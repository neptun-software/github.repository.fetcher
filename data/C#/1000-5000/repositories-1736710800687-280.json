The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Query by sheet name\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.Query(path, sheetName: \"SheetName\");\n//or\nstream.Query(sheetName: \"SheetName\");\n```\n\n#### 6. Query all sheet name and rows\n\n```csharp\nvar sheetNames = MiniExcel.GetSheetNames(path);\nforeach (var sheetName in sheetNames)\n{\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, sheetName: sheetName);\n}\n```\n\n#### 7. Get Columns\n\n```csharp\nvar columns = MiniExcel.GetColumns(path); // e.g result : [\"A\",\"B\"...]\n\nvar cnt = columns.Count;  // get column count\n```\n\n#### 8. Dynamic Query cast row to `IDictionary<string,object>`\n\n```csharp\nforeach(IDictionary<string,object> row in MiniExcel.Query(path))\n{\n    //..\n}\n\n// or\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(path).Cast<IDictionary<string,object>>();\n// or Query specified ranges (capitalized)\n// A2 represents the second row of column A, C3 represents the third row of column C\n// If you don't want to restrict rows, just don't include numbers\nvar rows = MiniExcel.QueryRange(path, startCell: \"A2\", endCell: \"C3\").Cast<IDictionary<string, object>>();\n```\n\n\n\n#### 9. Query Excel return DataTable\n\nNot recommended, because DataTable will load all data into memory and lose MiniExcel's low memory consumption feature.\n\n```C#\nvar table = MiniExcel.QueryAsDataTable(path, useHeaderRow: true);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116673475-07917200-a9d6-11eb-947e-a6f68cce58df.png)\n\n\n\n#### 10. Specify the cell to start reading data\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.Query(path,useHeaderRow:true,startCell:\"B3\")\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117260316-8593c400-ae81-11eb-9877-c087b7ac2b01.png)\n\n\n\n#### 11. Fill Merged Cells\n\nNote: The efficiency is slower compared to `not using merge fill`\n\nReason: The OpenXml standard puts mergeCells at the bottom of the file, which leads to the need to foreach the sheetxml twice\n\n```csharp\n    var config = new OpenXmlConfiguration()\n    {\n        FillMergedCells = true\n    };\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117973630-3527d500-b35f-11eb-95c3-bde255f8114e.png)\n\nsupport variable length and width multi-row and column filling\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117973820-6d2f1800-b35f-11eb-88d8-555063938108.png)\n\n#### 12. Reading big file by disk-base cache (Disk-Base Cache - SharedString)\n\nIf the SharedStrings size exceeds 5 MB, MiniExcel default will use local disk cache, e.g, [10x100000.xlsx](https://github.com/MiniExcel/MiniExcel/files/8403819/NotDuplicateSharedStrings_10x100000.xlsx)(one million rows data), when disable disk cache the maximum memory usage is 195MB, but able disk cache only needs 65MB. Note, this optimization needs some efficiency cost, so this case will increase reading time from 7.4 seconds to 27.2 seconds, If you don't need it that you can disable disk cache with the following code:\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration { EnableSharedStringCache = false };\nMiniExcel.Query(path,configuration: config)\n```\n\nYou can use `SharedStringCacheSize ` to change the sharedString file size beyond the specified size for disk caching\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration { SharedStringCacheSize=500*1024*1024 };\nMiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config);\n```\n\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/161411851-1c3f72a7-33b3-4944-84dc-ffc1d16747dd.png)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/161411825-17f53ec7-bef4-4b16-b234-e24799ea41b0.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Create/Export Excel  <a name=\"getstart2\"></a>\n\n1. Must be a non-abstract type with a public parameterless constructor .\n\n2. MiniExcel support parameter IEnumerable Deferred Execution, If you want to use least memory, please do not call methods such as ToList\n\ne.g : ToList or not memory usage\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/112587389-752b0b00-8e38-11eb-8a52-cfb76c57e5eb.png)\n\n\n\n#### 1. Anonymous or strongly type [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/w5WD1J)\n\n```csharp\nvar path = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), $\"{Guid.NewGuid()}.xlsx\");\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, new[] {\n    new { Column1 = \"MiniExcel\", Column2 = 1 },\n    new { Column1 = \"Github\", Column2 = 2}\n});\n```\n\n#### 2. `IEnumerable<IDictionary<string, object>>`\n\n```csharp\nvar values = new List<Dictionary<string, object>>()\n{\n    new Dictionary<string,object>{{ \"Column1\", \"MiniExcel\" }, { \"Column2\", 1 } },\n    new Dictionary<string,object>{{ \"Column1\", \"Github\" }, { \"Column2\", 2 } }\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, values);\n```\n\nCreate File Result :\n\n| Column1 | Column2 |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| MiniExcel     | 1     |\n| Github     | 2     |\n\n\n#### 3.  IDataReader\n- `Recommended`, it can avoid to load all data into memory\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, reader);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/121275378-149a5e80-c8bc-11eb-85fe-5453552134f0.png)\n\nDataReader export multiple sheets (recommand by Dapper ExecuteReader)\n\n```csharp\nusing (var cnn = Connection)\n{\n    cnn.Open();\n    var sheets = new Dictionary<string,object>();\n    sheets.Add(\"sheet1\", cnn.ExecuteReader(\"select 1 id\"));\n    sheets.Add(\"sheet2\", cnn.ExecuteReader(\"select 2 id\"));\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(\"Demo.xlsx\", sheets);\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### 4. Datatable\n\n- `Not recommended`, it will load all data into memory\n\n- DataTable use Caption for column name first, then use columname\n\n```csharp\nvar path = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), $\"{Guid.NewGuid()}.xlsx\");\nvar table = new DataTable();\n{\n    table.Columns.Add(\"Column1\", typeof(string));\n    table.Columns.Add(\"Column2\", typeof(decimal));\n    table.Rows.Add(\"MiniExcel\", 1);\n    table.Rows.Add(\"Github\", 2);\n}\n\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, table);\n```\n\n####  5. Dapper Query\n\nThanks @shaofing #552 , please use `CommandDefinition + CommandFlags.NoCache`\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = GetConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    var rows = connection.Query(\n        new CommandDefinition(\n            @\"select 'MiniExcel' as Column1,1 as Column2 union all select 'Github',2\"\n            , flags: CommandFlags.NoCache)\n        );\n    // Note: QueryAsync will throw close connection exception\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, rows);\n}\n```\n\nBelow code will load all data into memory\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = GetConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    var rows = connection.Query(@\"select 'MiniExcel' as Column1,1 as Column2 union all select 'Github',2\");\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, rows);\n}\n```\n\n\n#### 6.

Create Multiple Sheets\n\n```csharp\n// 1. Dictionary<string,object>\nvar users = new[] { new { Name = \"Jack\", Age = 25 }, new { Name = \"Mike\", Age = 44 } };\nvar department = new[] { new { ID = \"01\", Name = \"HR\" }, new { ID = \"02\", Name = \"IT\" } };\nvar sheets = new Dictionary<string, object>\n{\n    [\"users\"] = users,\n    [\"department\"] = department\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, sheets);\n\n// 2.

TableStyles Options\n\nDefault style\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/138234373-cfa97109-b71f-4711-b7f5-0eaaa4a0a3a6.png)\n\nWithout style configuration\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration()\n{\n     TableStyles = TableStyles.None\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value,configuration:config);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/118784917-f3e57700-b8c2-11eb-8718-8d955b1bc197.png)\n\n\n#### 9. AutoFilter\n\nSince v0.19.0  `OpenXmlConfiguration.AutoFilter` can en/unable AutoFilter , default value is `true`, and setting AutoFilter way:\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value, configuration: new OpenXmlConfiguration() { AutoFilter = false });\n```\n\n\n\n#### 10. Create Image\n\n```csharp\nvar value = new[] {\n    new { Name=\"github\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/github_logo.png\"))},\n    new { Name=\"google\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/google_logo.png\"))},\n    new { Name=\"microsoft\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/microsoft_logo.png\"))},\n    new { Name=\"reddit\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/reddit_logo.png\"))},\n    new { Name=\"statck_overflow\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/statck_overflow_logo.png\"))},\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/150462383-ad9931b3-ed8d-4221-a1d6-66f799743433.png)\n\n\n\n#### 11. Byte Array File Export\n\nSince 1.22.0, when value type is `byte[]` then system will save file path at cell by default, and when import system can be converted to `byte[]`. And if you don't want to use it, you can set  `OpenXmlConfiguration.EnableConvertByteArray` to `false`, it can improve the system efficiency.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/153702334-c3b834f4-6ae4-4ddf-bd4e-e5005d5d8c6a.png)\n\nSince 1.22.0, when value type is `byte[]` then system will save file path at cell by default, and when import system can be converted to `byte[]`.

Each statement should be new line.\n4. Single space should be added before and after operators.\n5. There shouldn't be new line inside of statements.\n6. Cell should be in exact format as below.\n\n```csharp\n@if(name == Jack)\n{{employees.name}}\n@elseif(name == Neo)\nTest {{employees.name}}\n@else\n{{employees.department}}\n@endif\n```\n\nBefore\n\n![if_before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38832863/235360606-ca654769-ff55-4f5b-98d2-d2ec0edb8173.PNG)\n\nAfter\n\n![if_after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38832863/235360609-869bb960-d63d-45ae-8d64-9e8b0d0ab658.PNG)\n\n#### 9. DataTable as parameter\n\n```csharp\nvar managers = new DataTable();\n{\n    managers.Columns.Add(\"name\");\n    managers.Columns.Add(\"department\");\n    managers.Rows.Add(\"Jack\", \"HR\");\n    managers.Rows.Add(\"Loan\", \"IT\");\n}\nvar value = new Dictionary<string, object>()\n{\n    [\"title\"] = \"FooCompany\",\n    [\"managers\"] = managers,\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAsByTemplate(path, templatePath, value);\n```\n#### 10. Formulas \n\n##### 1. Example\nPrefix your formula with `$` and use `$enumrowstart` and `$enumrowend` to mark references to the enumerable start and end rows:\n\n![image](docs/images/template-formulas-1.png)\n\nWhen the template is rendered, the `$` prefix will be removed and `$enumrowstart` and `$enumrowend` will be replaced with the start and end row numbers of the enumerable:\n\n![image](docs/images/template-formulas-2.png)\n\n##### 2. Other Example Formulas:\n\n|            |                                                                                         |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Sum         |`$=SUM(C{{$enumrowstart}}:C{{$enumrowend}})`                                             |\n|Alt. Average|`$=SUM(C{{$enumrowstart}}:C{{$enumrowend}}) / COUNT(C{{$enumrowstart}}:C{{$enumrowend}})`|\n|Range       |`$=MAX(C{{$enumrowstart}}:C{{$enumrowend}}) - MIN(C{{$enumrowstart}}:C{{$enumrowend}})`  |\n\n\n#### 11. Other\n\n##### 1. Checking template parameter key\n\nSince V1.24.0 , default ignore template missing parameter key and replace it with empty string, `IgnoreTemplateParameterMissing` can control throwing exception or not.\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration()\n{\n    IgnoreTemplateParameterMissing = false,\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAsByTemplate(path, templatePath, value, config)\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/157464332-e316f829-54aa-4c84-a5aa-9aef337b668d.png)\n\n\n\n### Excel Column Name/Index/Ignore Attribute <a name=\"getstart4\"></a>\n\n\n\n#### 1. Specify the column name, column index, column ignore\n\nExcel Example\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/114230869-3e163700-99ac-11eb-9a90-2039d4b4b313.png)\n\nCode\n\n```csharp\npublic class ExcelAttributeDemo\n{\n    [ExcelColumnName(\"Column1\")]\n    public string Test1 { get; set; }\n    [ExcelColumnName(\"Column2\")]\n    public string Test2 { get; set; }\n    [ExcelIgnore]\n    public string Test3 { get; set; }\n    [ExcelColumnIndex(\"I\")] // system will convert \"I\" to 8 index\n    public string Test4 { get; set; }\n    public string Test5 { get; } //wihout set will ignore\n    public string Test6 { get; private set; } //un-public set will ignore\n    [ExcelColumnIndex(3)] // start with 0\n    public string Test7 { get; set; }\n}\n\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query<ExcelAttributeDemo>(path).ToList();\nAssert.Equal(\"Column1\", rows[0].Test1);\nAssert.Equal(\"Column2\", rows[0].Test2);\nAssert.Null(rows[0].Test3);\nAssert.Equal(\"Test7\", rows[0].Test4);\nAssert.Null(rows[0].Test5);\nAssert.Null(rows[0].Test6);\nAssert.Equal(\"Test4\", rows[0].Test7);\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### 2. Custom Format (ExcelFormatAttribute)\n\nSince V0.21.0 support class which contains `ToString(string content)` method format\n\nClass\n\n```csharp\npublic class Dto\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n\n    [ExcelFormat(\"MMMM dd, yyyy\")]\n    public DateTime InDate { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nCode\n\n```csharp\nvar value = new Dto[] {\n    new Issue241Dto{ Name=\"Jack\",InDate=new DateTime(2021,01,04)},\n    new Issue241Dto{ Name=\"Henry\",InDate=new DateTime(2020,04,05)},\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value);\n```\n\nResult\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/118910788-ab2bcd80-b957-11eb-8d42-bfce36621b1b.png)\n\nQuery supports custom format conversion\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/118911286-87b55280-b958-11eb-9a88-c8ff403d240a.png)\n\n#### 3. Set Column Width(ExcelColumnWidthAttribute)\n\n```csharp\npublic class Dto\n{\n    [ExcelColumnWidth(20)]\n    public int ID { get; set; }\n    [ExcelColumnWidth(15.50)]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Multiple column names mapping to the same property.\n\n```csharp\npublic class Dto\n{\n    [ExcelColumnName(excelColumnName:\"EmployeeNo\",aliases:new[] { \"EmpNo\",\"No\" })]\n    public string Empno { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### 5. System.ComponentModel.DisplayNameAttribute = ExcelColumnName.excelColumnNameAttribute\n\nSince 1.24.0, system supports System.ComponentModel.DisplayNameAttribute = ExcelColumnName.excelColumnNameAttribute\n\n```C#\npublic class TestIssueI4TXGTDto\n{\n    public int ID { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    [DisplayName(\"Specification\")]\n    public string Spc { get; set; }\n    [DisplayName(\"Unit Price\")]\n    public decimal Up { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### 6. ExcelColumnAttribute\n\nSince V1.26.0, multiple attributes can be simplified like :\n```csharp\n        public class TestIssueI4ZYUUDto\n        {\n            [ExcelColumn(Name = \"ID\",Index =0)]\n            public string MyProperty { get; set; }\n            [ExcelColumn(Name = \"CreateDate\", Index = 1,Format =\"yyyy-MM\",Width =100)]\n            public DateTime MyProperty2 { get; set; }\n        }\n```\n\n\n\n#### 7. DynamicColumnAttribute\n\nSince V1.26.0, we can set the attributes of Column dynamically\n```csharp\n            var config = new OpenXmlConfiguration\n            {\n                DynamicColumns = new DynamicExcelColumn[] {\n                    new DynamicExcelColumn(\"id\"){Ignore=true},\n                    new DynamicExcelColumn(\"name\"){Index=1,Width=10},\n                    new DynamicExcelColumn(\"createdate\"){Index=0,Format=\"yyyy-MM-dd\",Width=15},\n                    new DynamicExcelColumn(\"point\"){Index=2,Name=\"Account Point\"},\n                }\n            };\n            var path = PathHelper.GetTempPath();\n            var value = new[] { new { id = 1, name = \"Jack\", createdate = new DateTime(2022, 04, 12) ,point = 123.456} };\n            MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value, configuration: config);\n```\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/164510353-5aecbc4e-c3ce-41e8-b6cf-afd55eb23b68.png)\n\n#### 8. DynamicSheetAttribute\n\nSince V1.31.4 we can set the attributes of Sheet dynamically. We can set sheet name and state (visibility).\n```csharp\n            var configuration = new OpenXmlConfiguration\n            {\n                DynamicSheets = new DynamicExcelSheet[] {\n                    new DynamicExcelSheet(\"usersSheet\") { Name = \"Users\", State = SheetState.Visible },\n                    new DynamicExcelSheet(\"departmentSheet\") { Name = \"Departments\", State = SheetState.Hidden }\n                }\n            };\n\n            var users = new[] { new { Name = \"Jack\", Age = 25 }, new { Name = \"Mike\", Age = 44 } };\n            var department = new[] { new { ID = \"01\", Name = \"HR\" }, new { ID = \"02\", Name = \"IT\" } };\n            var sheets = new Dictionary<string, object>\n            {\n                [\"usersSheet\"] = users,\n                [\"departmentSheet\"] = department\n            };\n\n            var path = PathHelper.GetTempPath();\n            MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, sheets, configuration: configuration);\n```\n\nWe can also use new attribute ExcelSheetAttribute:\n\n```C#\n   [ExcelSheet(Name = \"Departments\", State = SheetState.Hidden)]\n   private class DepartmentDto\n   {\n      [ExcelColumn(Name = \"ID\",Index = 0)]\n      public string ID { get; set; }\n      [ExcelColumn(Name = \"Name\",Index = 1)]\n      public string Name { get; set; }\n   }\n```\n\n### Add, Delete, Update\n\n#### Add\n\nv1.28.0 support CSV insert N rows data after last row\n\n```csharp\n// Origin\n{\n    var value = new[] {\n          new { ID=1,Name =\"Jack\",InDate=new DateTime(2021,01,03)},\n          new { ID=2,Name =\"Henry\",InDate=new DateTime(2020,05,03)},\n    };\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value);\n}\n// Insert 1 rows after last\n{\n    var value = new { ID=3,Name = \"Mike\", InDate = new DateTime(2021, 04, 23) };\n    MiniExcel.Insert(path, value);\n}\n// Insert N rows after last\n{\n    var value = new[] {\n          new { ID=4,Name =\"Frank\",InDate=new DateTime(2021,06,07)},\n          new { ID=5,Name =\"Gloria\",InDate=new DateTime(2022,05,03)},\n    };\n    MiniExcel.Insert(path, value);\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/191023733-1e2fa732-db5c-4a3a-9722-b891fe5aa069.png)\n\n\n\n#### Delete(waiting)\n\n#### Update(waiting)\n\n\n\n### Excel Type Auto Check <a name=\"getstart5\"></a>\n\n- MiniExcel will check whether it is xlsx or csv based on the `file extension` by default, but there may be inaccuracy, please specify it manually.\n- Stream cannot be know from which excel, please specify it manually.\n\n```csharp\nstream.SaveAs(excelType:ExcelType.CSV);\n//or\nstream.SaveAs(excelType:ExcelType.XLSX);\n//or\nstream.Query(excelType:ExcelType.CSV);\n//or\nstream.Query(excelType:ExcelType.XLSX);\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### CSV\n\n#### Note\n\n- Default return `string` type, and value will not be converted to numbers or datetime, unless the type is defined by strong typing generic.\n\n\n\n#### Custom separator\n\nThe default is `,` as the separator, you can modify the `Seperator` property for customization\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new MiniExcelLibs.Csv.CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    Seperator=';'\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, values,configuration: config);\n```\n\nSince V1.30.1 support function to custom separator (thanks @hyzx86)\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    SplitFn = (row) => Regex.Split(row, $\"[\\t,](?=(?:[^\\\"]|\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\")*$)\")\n        .Select(s => Regex.Replace(s.Replace(\"\\\"\\\"\", \"\\\"\"), \"^\\\"|\\\"$\", \"\")).ToArray()\n};\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config).ToList();\n```\n\n\n\n#### Custom line break\n\nThe default is `\\r\\n` as the newline character, you can modify the `NewLine` property for customization\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new MiniExcelLibs.Csv.CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    NewLine='\\n'\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, values,configuration: config);\n```\n\n\n\n#### Custom coding\n\n- The default encoding is \"Detect Encoding From Byte Order Marks\"  (detectEncodingFromByteOrderMarks: true)\n- f you have custom encoding requirements, please modify the StreamReaderFunc / StreamWriterFunc  property\n\n```csharp\n// Read\nvar config = new MiniExcelLibs.Csv.CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    StreamReaderFunc = (stream) => new StreamReader(stream,Encoding.GetEncoding(\"gb2312\"))\n};\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, true,excelType:ExcelType.CSV,configuration: config);\n\n// Write\nvar config = new MiniExcelLibs.Csv.CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    StreamWriterFunc = (stream) => new StreamWriter(stream, Encoding.GetEncoding(\"gb2312\"))\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value,excelType:ExcelType.CSV, configuration: config);\n```\n\n#### Read empty string as null\n\nBy default, empty values are mapped to string.Empty. You can modify this behavior\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new MiniExcelLibs.Csv.CsvConfiguration()\n{\n   ReadEmptyStringAsNull = true\n};\n```\n\n\n### DataReader\n\n#### 1. GetReader\nSince 1.23.0, you can GetDataReader\n\n```csharp\n    using (var reader = MiniExcel.GetReader(path,true))\n    {\n        while (reader.Read())\n        {\n            for (int i = 0; i < reader.FieldCount; i++)\n            {\n                var value = reader.GetValue(i);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n\n\n###  Async\n\n- v0.17.0 support Async (thanks isdaniel ( SHIH,BING-SIOU)](https://github.com/isdaniel))\n\n```csharp\npublic static Task SaveAsAsync(string path, object value, bool printHeader = true, string sheetName = \"Sheet1\", ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, IConfiguration configuration = null)\npublic static Task SaveAsAsync(this Stream stream, object value, bool printHeader = true, string sheetName = \"Sheet1\", ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.XLSX, IConfiguration configuration = null)\npublic static Task<IEnumerable<dynamic>> QueryAsync(string path, bool useHeaderRow = false, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null)\npublic static Task<IEnumerable<T>> QueryAsync<T>(this Stream stream, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null) where T : class, new()\npublic static Task<IEnumerable<T>> QueryAsync<T>(string path, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null) where T : class, new()\npublic static Task<IEnumerable<IDictionary<string, object>>> QueryAsync(this Stream stream, bool useHeaderRow = false, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null)\npublic static Task SaveAsByTemplateAsync(this Stream stream, string templatePath, object value)\npublic static Task SaveAsByTemplateAsync(this Stream stream, byte[] templateBytes, object value)\npublic static Task SaveAsByTemplateAsync(string path, string templatePath, object value)\npublic static Task SaveAsByTemplateAsync(string path, byte[] templateBytes, object value)\npublic static Task<DataTable> QueryAsDataTableAsync(string path, bool useHeaderRow = true, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null)\n```\n\n-  v1.25.0 support `cancellationToken`。\n\n\n\n### Others\n\n#### 1. Enum\n\nBe sure excel & property name same, system will auto mapping (case insensitive)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116210595-9784b100-a775-11eb-936f-8e7a8b435961.png)\n\nSince V0.18.0 support Enum Description\n\n```csharp\npublic class Dto\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public I49RYZUserType UserType { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic enum Type\n{\n    [Description(\"General User\")]\n    V1,\n    [Description(\"General Administrator\")]\n    V2,\n    [Description(\"Super Administrator\")]\n    V3\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/133116630-27cc7161-099a-48b8-9784-cd1e443af3d1.png)\n\nSince 1.30.0 version support excel Description to Enum , thanks @KaneLeung\n\n#### 2. Convert CSV to XLSX or Convert XLSX to CSV\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.ConvertXlsxToCsv(xlsxPath, csvPath);\nMiniExcel.ConvertXlsxToCsv(xlsxStream, csvStream);\nMiniExcel.ConvertCsvToXlsx(csvPath, xlsxPath);\nMiniExcel.ConvertCsvToXlsx(csvStream, xlsxStream);\n```\n```csharp\nusing (var excelStream = new FileStream(path: filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))\nusing (var csvStream = new MemoryStream())\n{\n   MiniExcel.ConvertXlsxToCsv(excelStream, csvStream);\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Custom CultureInfo\n\nSince 1.22.0, you can custom CultureInfo like below, system default `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`.\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    Culture = new CultureInfo(\"fr-FR\"),\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value, configuration: config);\n\n// or\nMiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config);\n```\n\n\n#### 4. Custom Buffer Size\n```csharp\n    public abstract class Configuration : IConfiguration\n    {\n        public int BufferSize { get; set; } = 1024 * 512;\n    }\n```\n\n#### 5. FastMode\n\nSystem will not control memory, but you can get faster save speed.\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration() { FastMode = true };\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, reader,configuration:config);\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Examples:\n\n#### 1. SQLite & Dapper `Large Size File` SQL Insert Avoid OOM\n\nnote : please don't call ToList/ToArray methods after Query, it'll load all data into memory\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = new SQLiteConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())\n    using (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n    {\n       var rows = stream.Query();\n       foreach (var row in rows)\n             connection.Execute(\"insert into T (A,B) values (@A,@B)\", new { row.A, row.B }, transaction: transaction);\n       transaction.Commit();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nperformance:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/111072579-2dda7b80-8516-11eb-9843-c01a1edc88ec.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Dynamic i18n multi-language and role authority management\n\nLike the example, create a method to handle i18n and permission management, and use `yield return to return IEnumerable<Dictionary<string, object>>` to achieve dynamic and low-memory processing effects\n\n```csharp\nvoid Main()\n{\n    var value = new Order[] {\n        new Order(){OrderNo = \"SO01\",CustomerID=\"C001\",ProductID=\"P001\",Qty=100,Amt=500},\n        new Order(){OrderNo = \"SO02\",CustomerID=\"C002\",ProductID=\"P002\",Qty=300,Amt=400},\n    };\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"en-Us and Sales role\");\n    {\n        var path = Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid() + \".xlsx\";\n        var lang = \"en-US\";\n        var role = \"Sales\";\n        MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, GetOrders(lang, role, value));\n        MiniExcel.Query(path, true).Dump();\n    }\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"zh-CN and PMC role\");\n    {\n        var path = Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid() + \".xlsx\";\n        var lang = \"zh-CN\";\n        var role = \"PMC\";\n        MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, GetOrders(lang, role, value));\n        MiniExcel.Query(path, true).Dump();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate IEnumerable<Dictionary<string, object>> GetOrders(string lang, string role, Order[] orders)\n{\n    foreach (var order in orders)\n    {\n        var newOrder = new Dictionary<string, object>();\n\n        if (lang == \"zh-CN\")\n        {\n            newOrder.Add(\"客户编号\", order.CustomerID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"订单编号\", order.OrderNo);\n            newOrder.Add(\"产品编号\", order.ProductID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"数量\", order.Qty);\n            if (role == \"Sales\")\n                newOrder.Add(\"价格\", order.Amt);\n            yield return newOrder;\n        }\n        else if (lang == \"en-US\")\n        {\n            newOrder.Add(\"Customer ID\", order.CustomerID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"Order No\", order.OrderNo);\n            newOrder.Add(\"Product ID\", order.ProductID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"Quantity\", order.Qty);\n            if (role == \"Sales\")\n                newOrder.Add(\"Amount\", order.Amt);\n            yield return newOrder;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new InvalidDataException($\"lang {lang} wrong\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Order\n{\n    public string OrderNo { get; set; }\n    public string CustomerID { get; set; }\n    public decimal Qty { get; set; }\n    public string ProductID { get; set; }\n    public decimal Amt { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/118939964-d24bc480-b982-11eb-88dd-f06655f6121a.png)\n\n\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Q: Excel header title not equal class property name, how to mapping?\n\nA. Please use ExcelColumnName attribute\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116020475-eac50980-a678-11eb-8804-129e87200e5e.png)\n\n#### Q. How to query or export multiple-sheets?\n\nA. `GetSheetNames` method with  Query  sheetName parameter.\n\n\n\n```csharp\nvar sheets = MiniExcel.GetSheetNames(path);\nforeach (var sheet in sheets)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"sheet name : {sheet} \");\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path,useHeaderRow:true,sheetName:sheet);\n    Console.WriteLine(rows);\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116199841-2a1f5300-a76a-11eb-90a3-6710561cf6db.png)\n\n#### Q. How to query or export information about sheet visibility?\n\nA. `GetSheetInformations` method.\n\n\n\n```csharp\nvar sheets = MiniExcel.GetSheetInformations(path);\nforeach (var sheetInfo in sheets)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"sheet index : {sheetInfo.Index} \"); // next sheet index - numbered from 0\n    Console.WriteLine($\"sheet name : {sheetInfo.Name} \");   // sheet name\n    Console.WriteLine($\"sheet state : {sheetInfo.State} \"); // sheet visibility state - visible / hidden\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Q. Whether to use Count will load all data into the memory?\n\nNo, the image test has 1 million rows*10 columns of data, the maximum memory usage is <60MB, and it takes 13.65 seconds\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117118518-70586000-adc3-11eb-9ce3-2ba76cf8b5e5.png)\n\n#### Q. How does Query use integer indexs?\n\nThe default index of Query is the string Key: A,B,C.... If you want to change to numeric index, please create the following method to convert\n\n```csharp\nvoid Main()\n{\n    var path = @\"D:\\git\\MiniExcel\\samples\\xlsx\\TestTypeMapping.xlsx\";\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path,true);\n    foreach (var r in ConvertToIntIndexRows(rows))\n    {\n        Console.Write($\"column 0 : {r[0]} ,column 1 : {r[1]}\");\n        Console.WriteLine();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate IEnumerable<Dictionary<int, object>> ConvertToIntIndexRows(IEnumerable<object> rows)\n{\n    ICollection<string> keys = null;\n    var isFirst = true;\n    foreach (IDictionary<string,object> r in rows)\n    {\n        if(isFirst)\n        {\n            keys = r.Keys;\n            isFirst = false;\n        }\n\n        var dic = new Dictionary<int, object>();\n        var index = 0;\n        foreach (var key in keys)\n            dic[index++] = r[key];\n        yield return dic;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Q. No title empty excel is generated when the value is empty when exporting Excel\n\nBecause MiniExcel uses a logic similar to JSON.NET to dynamically get type from values to simplify API operations, type cannot be knew without data. You can check [issue #133](https://github.com/shps951023/MiniExcel/issues/133) for understanding.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/122639771-546c0c00-d12e-11eb-800c-498db27889ca.png)\n\n> Strong type & DataTable will generate headers, but Dictionary are still empty Excel\n\n#### Q. How to stop the foreach when blank row?\n\nMiniExcel can be used with `LINQ TakeWhile` to stop foreach iterator.\n\n![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/130209137-162621c2-f337-4479-9996-beeac65bc4d4.png)\n\n#### Q.

Query 查询 Excel 返回`Dynamic` IEnumerable 数据 [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/w5WD1J)\n\n* Key 系统预设为 `A,B,C,D...Z`\n\n| MiniExcel     | 1     |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| Github     | 2     |\n\n```csharp\n\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(path).ToList();\n\n// or\nusing (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n{\n    var rows = stream.Query().ToList();\n\n    Assert.Equal(\"MiniExcel\", rows[0].A);\n    Assert.Equal(1, rows[0].B);\n    Assert.Equal(\"Github\", rows[1].A);\n    Assert.Equal(2, rows[1].B);\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. 查询数据以第一行数据当Key [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/w5WD1J)\n\n注意 : 同名以右边数据为准\n\nInput Excel :\n\n| Column1 | Column2 |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| MiniExcel     | 1     |\n| Github     | 2     |\n\n\n```csharp\n\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(useHeaderRow:true).ToList();\n\n// or\n\nusing (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n{\n    var rows = stream.Query(useHeaderRow:true).ToList();\n\n    Assert.Equal(\"MiniExcel\", rows[0].Column1);\n    Assert.Equal(1, rows[0].Column2);\n    Assert.Equal(\"Github\", rows[1].Column1);\n    Assert.Equal(2, rows[1].Column2);\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Query 查询支援延迟加载(Deferred Execution)，能配合LINQ First/Take/Skip办到低消耗、高效率复杂查询\n\n举例 : 查询第一笔数据\n\n```csharp\nvar row = MiniExcel.Query(path).First();\nAssert.Equal(\"HelloWorld\", row.A);\n\n// or\n\nusing (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n{\n    var row = stream.Query().First();\n    Assert.Equal(\"HelloWorld\", row.A);\n}\n```\n\n与其他框架效率比较 :\n\n![queryfirst](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/111072392-6037a900-8515-11eb-9693-5ce2dad1e460.gif)\n\n#### 5. 查询指定 Sheet 名称\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.Query(path, sheetName: \"SheetName\");\n//or\nstream.Query(sheetName: \"SheetName\");\n```\n\n#### 6. 查询所有 Sheet 名称跟数据\n\n```csharp\nvar sheetNames = MiniExcel.GetSheetNames(path);\nforeach (var sheetName in sheetNames)\n{\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, sheetName: sheetName);\n}\n```\n\n#### 7. 查询所有栏(列)\n\n```csharp\nvar columns = MiniExcel.GetColumns(path); // e.g result : [\"A\",\"B\"...]\n\nor\n\nvar columns = MiniExcel.GetColumns(path, useHeaderRow: true);\n// e.g result : [\"excel表实际的列名称\",\"excel表实际的列名称\"...]\n\nvar cnt = columns.Count;  // get column count\n```\n\n#### 8. Dynamic Query 转成 `IDictionary<string,object>` 数据\n\n```csharp\nforeach(IDictionary<string,object> row in MiniExcel.Query(path))\n{\n    //..\n}\n\n// or\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(path).Cast<IDictionary<string,object>>();\n// or 查询指定范围（要大写才生效哦）\n// A2（左上角）代表A列的第二行，C3（右下角）代表C列的第三行\n// 如果你不想限制行，就不要包含数字\nvar rows = MiniExcel.QueryRange(path, startCell: \"A2\", endCell: \"C3\").Cast<IDictionary<string, object>>();\n```\n\n#### 9. Query 读 Excel 返回 DataTable\n\n提醒 : 不建议使用，因为DataTable会将数据`全载入内存`，失去MiniExcel低内存消耗功能。\n\n```C#\nvar table = MiniExcel.QueryAsDataTable(path, useHeaderRow: true);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116673475-07917200-a9d6-11eb-947e-a6f68cce58df.png)\n\n#### 10. 指定单元格开始读取数据\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.Query(path,useHeaderRow:true,startCell:\"B3\")\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117260316-8593c400-ae81-11eb-9877-c087b7ac2b01.png)\n\n#### 11. 合并的单元格填充\n\n注意 : 效率相对于`没有使用合并填充`来说差\n底层原因 : OpenXml 标准将 mergeCells 放在文件最下方，导致需要遍历两次 sheetxml\n\n```csharp\n    var config = new OpenXmlConfiguration()\n    {\n        FillMergedCells = true\n    };\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117973630-3527d500-b35f-11eb-95c3-bde255f8114e.png)\n\n\n支持不固定长宽多行列填充\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117973820-6d2f1800-b35f-11eb-88d8-555063938108.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n#### 12. 读取大文件硬盘缓存 (Disk-Base Cache - SharedString)\n\n概念 : MiniExcel 当判断文件 SharedString 大小超过 5MB，预设会使用本地缓存，如 [10x100000.xlsx](https://github.com/MiniExcel/MiniExcel/files/8403819/NotDuplicateSharedStrings_10x100000.xlsx)(一百万笔数据)，读取不开启本地缓存需要最高内存使用约195MB，开启后降为65MB。但要特别注意，此优化是以`时间换取内存减少`，所以读取效率会变慢，此例子读取时间从 7.4 秒提高到 27.2 秒，假如不需要能用以下代码关闭硬盘缓存\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration { EnableSharedStringCache = false };\nMiniExcel.Query(path,configuration: config)\n```\n\n也能使用 SharedStringCacheSize 调整 sharedString 文件大小超过指定大小才做硬盘缓存\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration { SharedStringCacheSize=500*1024*1024 };\nMiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config);\n```\n\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/161411851-1c3f72a7-33b3-4944-84dc-ffc1d16747dd.png)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/161411825-17f53ec7-bef4-4b16-b234-e24799ea41b0.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n### 写/导出 Excel  <a name=\"getstart2\"></a>\n\n1. 必须是非abstract 类别有公开无参数构造函数\n2. MiniExcel SaveAs 支援 `IEnumerable参数延迟查询`，除非必要请不要使用 ToList 等方法读取全部数据到内存\n\n图片 : 是否呼叫 ToList 的内存差别\n\n#### ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/112587389-752b0b00-8e38-11eb-8a52-cfb76c57e5eb.png)1. 支持集合<匿名类别>或是<强型别> [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/w5WD1J)\n\n```csharp\nvar path = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), $\"{Guid.NewGuid()}.xlsx\");\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, new[] {\n    new { Column1 = \"MiniExcel\", Column2 = 1 },\n    new { Column1 = \"Github\", Column2 = 2}\n});\n```\n\n\n\n#### 2. `IEnumerable<IDictionary<string, object>>`\n\n```csharp\nvar values = new List<Dictionary<string, object>>()\n{\n    new Dictionary<string,object>{{ \"Column1\", \"MiniExcel\" }, { \"Column2\", 1 } },\n    new Dictionary<string,object>{{ \"Column1\", \"Github\" }, { \"Column2\", 2 } }\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, values);\n```\n\noutput :\n\n| Column1   | Column2 |\n| --------- | ------- |\n| MiniExcel | 1       |\n| Github    | 2       |\n\n\n\n#### 3.  IDataReader\n\n- 推荐使用，可以避免载入全部数据到内存\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, reader);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/121275378-149a5e80-c8bc-11eb-85fe-5453552134f0.png)\n\n推荐 DataReader 多表格导出方式(建议使用 Dapper ExecuteReader )\n\n```csharp\nusing (var cnn = Connection)\n{\n    cnn.Open();\n    var sheets = new Dictionary<string,object>();\n    sheets.Add(\"sheet1\", cnn.ExecuteReader(\"select 1 id\"));\n    sheets.Add(\"sheet2\", cnn.ExecuteReader(\"select 2 id\"));\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(\"Demo.xlsx\", sheets);\n}\n```\n\n\n\n####  4. Datatable\n\n- 不推荐使用，会将数据全载入内存\n- 优先使用 Caption 当栏位名称\n\n```csharp\nvar path = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), $\"{Guid.NewGuid()}.xlsx\");\nvar table = new DataTable();\n{\n    table.Columns.Add(\"Column1\", typeof(string));\n    table.Columns.Add(\"Column2\", typeof(decimal));\n    table.Rows.Add(\"MiniExcel\", 1);\n    table.Rows.Add(\"Github\", 2);\n}\n\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, table);\n```\n\n####  5. Dapper Query\n\n感谢 @shaofing #552 更正，低内存请使用 `CommandDefinition + CommandFlags.NoCache`，如下\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = GetConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    var rows = connection.Query(\n        new CommandDefinition(\n            @\"select 'MiniExcel' as Column1,1 as Column2 union all select 'Github',2\"\n            , flags: CommandFlags.NoCache)\n        );\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, rows);\n}\n```\n上面的方法已知的问题：不能使用异步QueryAsync的方法，会报连接已经关闭的异常\n\n以下写法会将数据全载入内存\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = GetConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    var rows = connection.Query(@\"select 'MiniExcel' as Column1,1 as Column2 union all select 'Github',2\");\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, rows);\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### 6. SaveAs 支持 Stream，生成文件不落地 [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/JOen0e)\n\n```csharp\nusing (var stream = new MemoryStream()) //支持 FileStream,MemoryStream..等\n{\n    stream.SaveAs(values);\n}\n```\n\n像是 API 导出 Excel\n\n```csharp\npublic IActionResult DownloadExcel()\n{\n    var values = new[] {\n        new { Column1 = \"MiniExcel\", Column2 = 1 },\n        new { Column1 = \"Github\", Column2 = 2}\n    };\n\n    var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\n    memoryStream.SaveAs(values);\n    memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n    return new FileStreamResult(memoryStream, \"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\")\n    {\n        FileDownloadName = \"demo.xlsx\"\n    };\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### 7. 创建多个工作表(Sheet)\n\n```csharp\n// 1. Dictionary<string,object>\nvar users = new[] { new { Name = \"Jack\", Age = 25 }, new { Name = \"Mike\", Age = 44 } };\nvar department = new[] { new { ID = \"01\", Name = \"HR\" }, new { ID = \"02\", Name = \"IT\" } };\nvar sheets = new Dictionary<string, object>\n{\n    [\"users\"] = users,\n    [\"department\"] = department\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, sheets);\n\n// 2.

DynamicColumnAttribute 动态设定 Column\n\n从 1.26.0 版本开始，可以动态设定 Column 的属性\n```csharp\n            var config = new OpenXmlConfiguration\n            {\n                DynamicColumns = new DynamicExcelColumn[] {\n                    new DynamicExcelColumn(\"id\"){Ignore=true},\n                    new DynamicExcelColumn(\"name\"){Index=1,Width=10},\n                    new DynamicExcelColumn(\"createdate\"){Index=0,Format=\"yyyy-MM-dd\",Width=15},\n                    new DynamicExcelColumn(\"point\"){Index=2,Name=\"Account Point\"},\n                }\n            };\n            var path = PathHelper.GetTempPath();\n            var value = new[] { new { id = 1, name = \"Jack\", createdate = new DateTime(2022, 04, 12) ,point = 123.456} };\n            MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value, configuration: config);\n```\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/164510353-5aecbc4e-c3ce-41e8-b6cf-afd55eb23b68.png)\n\n\n\n### 新增、删除、修改\n\n#### 新增\n\nv1.28.0 开始支持 CSV 插入新增，在最后一行新增N笔数据\n\n```csharp\n// 原始数据\n{\n    var value = new[] {\n          new { ID=1,Name =\"Jack\",InDate=new DateTime(2021,01,03)},\n          new { ID=2,Name =\"Henry\",InDate=new DateTime(2020,05,03)},\n    };\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value);\n}\n// 最后一行新增一行数据\n{\n    var value = new { ID=3,Name = \"Mike\", InDate = new DateTime(2021, 04, 23) };\n    MiniExcel.Insert(path, value);\n}\n// 最后一行新增N行数据\n{\n    var value = new[] {\n          new { ID=4,Name =\"Frank\",InDate=new DateTime(2021,06,07)},\n          new { ID=5,Name =\"Gloria\",InDate=new DateTime(2022,05,03)},\n    };\n    MiniExcel.Insert(path, value);\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/191023733-1e2fa732-db5c-4a3a-9722-b891fe5aa069.png)\n\n\n\n#### 删除(未完成)\n\n#### 修改(未完成)\n\n### Excel 类别自动判断 <a name=\"getstart5\"></a>\n\n- MiniExcel 预设会根据`文件扩展名`判断是 xlsx 还是 csv，但会有失准时候，请自行指定。\n- Stream 类别无法判断来源于哪种 excel 请自行指定\n\n```csharp\nstream.SaveAs(excelType:ExcelType.CSV);\n//or\nstream.SaveAs(excelType:ExcelType.XLSX);\n//or\nstream.Query(excelType:ExcelType.CSV);\n//or\nstream.Query(excelType:ExcelType.XLSX);\n```\n\n\n\n### CSV\n\n#### 概念\n\n- 预设全以字串类型返回，预设不会转换为数字或者日期，除非有强型别定义泛型\n\n\n\n#### 自定分隔符\n\n预设以 `,` 作为分隔符，自定义请修改 `Seperator` 属性\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new MiniExcelLibs.Csv.CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    Seperator=';'\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, values,configuration: config);\n```\n\n\n\n#### 自定义换行符\n\n预设以 `\\r\\n` 作为换行符，自定义请修改 `NewLine` 属性\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new MiniExcelLibs.Csv.CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    NewLine='\\n'\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, values,configuration: config);\n```\n\n在 V1.30.1 版本开始支持动态更换换行符 (thanks @hyzx86)\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    SplitFn = (row) => Regex.Split(row, $\"[\\t,](?=(?:[^\\\"]|\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\")*$)\")\n        .Select(s => Regex.Replace(s.Replace(\"\\\"\\\"\", \"\\\"\"), \"^\\\"|\\\"$\", \"\")).ToArray()\n};\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config).ToList();\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n#### 自定义编码\n\n- 预设编码为「从Byte顺序标记检测编码」(detectEncodingFromByteOrderMarks: true)\n- 有自定义编码需求，请修改 StreamReaderFunc /  StreamWriterFunc 属性\n\n```csharp\n// Read\nvar config = new MiniExcelLibs.Csv.CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    StreamReaderFunc = (stream) => new StreamReader(stream,Encoding.GetEncoding(\"gb2312\"))\n};\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, true,excelType:ExcelType.CSV,configuration: config);\n\n// Write\nvar config = new MiniExcelLibs.Csv.CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    StreamWriterFunc = (stream) => new StreamWriter(stream, Encoding.GetEncoding(\"gb2312\"))\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value,excelType:ExcelType.CSV, configuration: config);\n```\n\n\n\n### DataReader\n\n#### 1. GetReader\n\n从 1.23.0 版本开始能获取 DataReader\n\n```csharp\n    using (var reader = MiniExcel.GetReader(path,true))\n    {\n        while (reader.Read())\n        {\n            for (int i = 0; i < reader.FieldCount; i++)\n            {\n                var value = reader.GetValue(i);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### 异步 Async\n\n- 从 v0.17.0 版本开始支持异步 (感谢[isdaniel ( SHIH,BING-SIOU)](https://github.com/isdaniel))\n\n```csharp\npublic static Task SaveAsAsync(string path, object value, bool printHeader = true, string sheetName = \"Sheet1\", ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, IConfiguration configuration = null)\npublic static Task SaveAsAsync(this Stream stream, object value, bool printHeader = true, string sheetName = \"Sheet1\", ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.XLSX, IConfiguration configuration = null)\npublic static Task<IEnumerable<dynamic>> QueryAsync(string path, bool useHeaderRow = false, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null)\npublic static Task<IEnumerable<T>> QueryAsync<T>(this Stream stream, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null) where T : class, new()\npublic static Task<IEnumerable<T>> QueryAsync<T>(string path, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null) where T : class, new()\npublic static Task<IEnumerable<IDictionary<string, object>>> QueryAsync(this Stream stream, bool useHeaderRow = false, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null)\npublic static Task SaveAsByTemplateAsync(this Stream stream, string templatePath, object value)\npublic static Task SaveAsByTemplateAsync(this Stream stream, byte[] templateBytes, object value)\npublic static Task SaveAsByTemplateAsync(string path, string templatePath, object value)\npublic static Task SaveAsByTemplateAsync(string path, byte[] templateBytes, object value)\npublic static Task<DataTable> QueryAsDataTableAsync(string path, bool useHeaderRow = true, string sheetName = null, ExcelType excelType = ExcelType.UNKNOWN, string startCell = \"A1\", IConfiguration configuration = null)\n```\n\n- 从 v1.25.0 开始支持 `cancellationToken`。\n\n\n\n### 其他\n\n#### 1. 映射枚举(enum)\n\n系统会自动映射(注意:大小写不敏感)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116210595-9784b100-a775-11eb-936f-8e7a8b435961.png)\n\n从V0.18.0版本开始支持Enum Description\n\n```csharp\npublic class Dto\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public Type UserType { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic enum Type\n{\n    [Description(\"General User\")]\n    V1,\n    [Description(\"General Administrator\")]\n    V2,\n    [Description(\"Super Administrator\")]\n    V3\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/133116630-27cc7161-099a-48b8-9784-cd1e443af3d1.png)\n\n从 1.30.0 版本开始支持由 Description 转回 Enum 功能，感谢 @KaneLeung\n\n\n\n#### 2. CSV 转 XLSX 或是 XLSX 转 CSV\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.ConvertXlsxToCsv(xlsxPath, csvPath);\nMiniExcel.ConvertXlsxToCsv(xlsxStream, csvStream);\nMiniExcel.ConvertCsvToXlsx(csvPath, xlsxPath);\nMiniExcel.ConvertCsvToXlsx(csvStream, xlsxStream);\n```\n```csharp\nusing (var excelStream = new FileStream(path: filePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))\nusing (var csvStream = new MemoryStream())\n{\n   MiniExcel.ConvertXlsxToCsv(excelStream, csvStream);\n}\n```\n#### 3. 自定义 CultureInfo\n\n从 1.22.0 版本开始，可以使用以下代码自定义文化信息，系统预设 `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`。\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new CsvConfiguration()\n{\n    Culture = new CultureInfo(\"fr-FR\"),\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value, configuration: config);\n\n//or\nMiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config);\n```\n\n#### 4. 导出自定义 Buffer Size\n```csharp\n    public abstract class Configuration : IConfiguration\n    {\n        public int BufferSize { get; set; } = 1024 * 512;\n    }\n```\n\n#### 5. FastMode\n\n系统不会限制内存，达到更快的效率\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration() { FastMode = true };\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, reader,configuration:config);\n```\n\n\n\n### 例子\n\n#### 1. SQLite & Dapper 读取大数据新增到数据库\n\nNote : 请不要呼叫 call ToList/ToArray 等方法，这会将所有数据读到内存内\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = new SQLiteConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())\n    using (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n    {\n       var rows = stream.Query();\n       foreach (var row in rows)\n             connection.Execute(\"insert into T (A,B) values (@A,@B)\", new { row.A, row.B }, transaction: transaction);\n       transaction.Commit();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n效能:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/111072579-2dda7b80-8516-11eb-9843-c01a1edc88ec.png)\n\n\n#### 2.

WebForm不落地导出Excel\n\n```csharp\nvar fileName = \"Demo.xlsx\";\nvar sheetName = \"Sheet1\";\nHttpResponse response = HttpContext.Current.Response;\nresponse.Clear();\nresponse.ContentType = \"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\";\nresponse.AddHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", $\"attachment;filename=\\\"{fileName}\\\"\");\nvar values = new[] {\n    new { Column1 = \"MiniExcel\", Column2 = 1 },\n    new { Column1 = \"Github\", Column2 = 2}\n};\nvar memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\nmemoryStream.SaveAs(values, sheetName: sheetName);\nmemoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\nmemoryStream.CopyTo(Response.OutputStream);\nresponse.End();\n```\n\n\n\n#### 5. 动态 i18n 多国语言跟权限管理\n\n像例子一样，建立一个方法处理 i18n 跟权限管理，并搭配 `yield return 返回 IEnumerable<Dictionary<string, object>>`，即可达到动态、低内存处理效果\n\n```csharp\nvoid Main()\n{\n    var value = new Order[] {\n        new Order(){OrderNo = \"SO01\",CustomerID=\"C001\",ProductID=\"P001\",Qty=100,Amt=500},\n        new Order(){OrderNo = \"SO02\",CustomerID=\"C002\",ProductID=\"P002\",Qty=300,Amt=400},\n    };\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"en-Us and Sales role\");\n    {\n        var path = Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid() + \".xlsx\";\n        var lang = \"en-US\";\n        var role = \"Sales\";\n        MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, GetOrders(lang, role, value));\n        MiniExcel.Query(path, true).Dump();\n    }\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"zh-CN and PMC role\");\n    {\n        var path = Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid() + \".xlsx\";\n        var lang = \"zh-CN\";\n        var role = \"PMC\";\n        MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, GetOrders(lang, role, value));\n        MiniExcel.Query(path, true).Dump();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate IEnumerable<Dictionary<string, object>> GetOrders(string lang, string role, Order[] orders)\n{\n    foreach (var order in orders)\n    {\n        var newOrder = new Dictionary<string, object>();\n\n        if (lang == \"zh-CN\")\n        {\n            newOrder.Add(\"客户编号\", order.CustomerID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"订单编号\", order.OrderNo);\n            newOrder.Add(\"产品编号\", order.ProductID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"数量\", order.Qty);\n            if (role == \"Sales\")\n                newOrder.Add(\"价格\", order.Amt);\n            yield return newOrder;\n        }\n        else if (lang == \"en-US\")\n        {\n            newOrder.Add(\"Customer ID\", order.CustomerID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"Order No\", order.OrderNo);\n            newOrder.Add(\"Product ID\", order.ProductID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"Quantity\", order.Qty);\n            if (role == \"Sales\")\n                newOrder.Add(\"Amount\", order.Amt);\n            yield return newOrder;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new InvalidDataException($\"lang {lang} wrong\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Order\n{\n    public string OrderNo { get; set; }\n    public string CustomerID { get; set; }\n    public decimal Qty { get; set; }\n    public string ProductID { get; set; }\n    public decimal Amt { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/118939964-d24bc480-b982-11eb-88dd-f06655f6121a.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### FAQ 常见问题\n\n#### Q: Excel 表头标题名称跟 class 属性名称不一致，如何对应?\n\nA. 请使用 ExcelColumnName 作 mapping\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116020475-eac50980-a678-11eb-8804-129e87200e5e.png)\n\n#### Q. 多工作表(sheet)如何导出/查询数据?\n\nA. 使用 `GetSheetNames `方法搭配 Query 的 sheetName 参数\n\n\n\n```csharp\nvar sheets = MiniExcel.GetSheetNames(path);\nforeach (var sheet in sheets)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"sheet name : {sheet} \");\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path,useHeaderRow:true,sheetName:sheet);\n    Console.WriteLine(rows);\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116199841-2a1f5300-a76a-11eb-90a3-6710561cf6db.png)\n\n\n\n#### Q. 是否使用 Count 会载入全部数据到内存\n\n不会，图片测试一百万行*十列数据，简单测试，内存最大使用 < 60MB，花费13.65秒\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117118518-70586000-adc3-11eb-9ce3-2ba76cf8b5e5.png)\n\n\n\n#### Q. Query如何使用整数索引取值?\n\nQuery 预设索引为字串Key : A,B,C....，想要改为数字索引，请建立以下方法自行转换\n\n```csharp\nvoid Main()\n{\n    var path = @\"D:\\git\\MiniExcel\\samples\\xlsx\\TestTypeMapping.xlsx\";\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path,true);\n    foreach (var r in ConvertToIntIndexRows(rows))\n    {\n        Console.Write($\"column 0 : {r[0]} ,column 1 : {r[1]}\");\n        Console.WriteLine();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate IEnumerable<Dictionary<int, object>> ConvertToIntIndexRows(IEnumerable<object> rows)\n{\n    ICollection<string> keys = null;\n    var isFirst = true;\n    foreach (IDictionary<string,object> r in rows)\n    {\n        if(isFirst)\n        {\n            keys = r.Keys;\n            isFirst = false;\n        }\n\n        var dic = new Dictionary<int, object>();\n        var index = 0;\n        foreach (var key in keys)\n            dic[index++] = r[key];\n        yield return dic;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Q. 导出时数组为空时生成没有标题空 Excel\n\n因为 MiniExcel 使用类似 JSON.NET 动态从值获取类别机制简化 API 操作，没有数据就无法获取类别。可以查看[ issue #133](https://github.com/shps951023/MiniExcel/issues/133) 了解。\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/122639771-546c0c00-d12e-11eb-800c-498db27889ca.png)\n\n> 强型别和 DataTable 会生成表头，但 Dicionary 依旧是空 Excel\n\n#### Q. 如何人为空白行中止遍历?\n\n常发生人为不小心在最后几行留下空白行情况，MiniExcel可以搭配 `LINQ TakeWhile`实现空白行中断遍历。\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/130209137-162621c2-f337-4479-9996-beeac65bc4d4.png)\n\n\n\n#### Q. 不想要空白行如何去除?\n\n\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/137873865-7107d8f5-eb59-42db-903a-44e80589f1b2.png)\n\n\n\nIEnumerable版本\n\n```csharp\npublic static IEnumerable<dynamic> QueryWithoutEmptyRow(Stream stream, bool useHeaderRow, string sheetName, ExcelType excelType, string startCell, IConfiguration configuration)\n{\n    var rows = stream.Query(useHeaderRow,sheetName,excelType,startCell,configuration);\n    foreach (IDictionary<string,object> row in rows)\n    {\n        if(row.Keys.Any(key=>row[key]!=null))\n            yield return row;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nDataTable版本\n\n```csharp\npublic static DataTable QueryAsDataTableWithoutEmptyRow(Stream stream, bool useHeaderRow, string sheetName, ExcelType excelType, string startCell, IConfiguration configuration)\n{\n    if (sheetName == null && excelType != ExcelType.CSV) /*Issue #279*/\n        sheetName = stream.GetSheetNames().First();\n\n    var dt = new DataTable(sheetName);\n    var first = true;\n    var rows = stream.Query(useHeaderRow,sheetName,excelType,startCell,configuration);\n    foreach (IDictionary<string, object> row in rows)\n    {\n        if (first)\n        {\n\n            foreach (var key in row.Keys)\n            {\n                var column = new DataColumn(key, typeof(object)) { Caption = key };\n                dt.Columns.Add(column);\n            }\n\n            dt.BeginLoadData();\n            first = false;\n        }\n\n        var newRow = dt.NewRow();\n        var isNull=true;\n        foreach (var key in row.Keys)\n        {\n            var _v = row[key];\n            if(_v!=null)\n                isNull = false;\n            newRow[key] = _v;\n        }\n\n        if(!isNull)\n            dt.Rows.Add(newRow);\n    }\n\n    dt.EndLoadData();\n    return dt;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### Q. 保存如何取代MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value)，文件存在系统会报已存在错误?\n\n请改以Stream自行管控Stream行为，如\n\n```C#\n    using (var stream = File.Create(\"Demo.xlsx\"))\n        MiniExcel.SaveAs(stream,value);\n```\n\n从V1.25.0版本开始，支持 overwriteFile 參數，方便調整是否要覆蓋已存在文件\n\n```csharp\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value, overwriteFile: true);\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### 局限与警告\n\n- 目前不支援 xls (97-2003) 或是加密文件\n- xlsm 只支持查询\n\n\n\n### 参考\n\n[ExcelDataReader](https://github.com/ExcelDataReader/ExcelDataReader)  / [ClosedXML](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML) / [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper) / [ExcelNumberFormat](https://github.com/andersnm/ExcelNumberFormat)\n\n\n\n### 感谢名单\n\n####  [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)\n\n![jetbrains-variant-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/123997015-8456c180-da02-11eb-829a-aec476fe8e94.png)\n\n感谢提供免费IDE支持此项目 ([License](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/123988233-6ab17c00-d9fa-11eb-8739-2a08c6a4a263.png))\n\n\n\n### 收益流水\n目前收益 https://github.com/mini-software/MiniExcel/issues/560#issue-2080619180\n\n\n### Contributors\n\n![](https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=shps951023/MiniExcel)\n\n"

簡單、高效避免OOM的.NET處理Excel查、寫、填充工具。\n\n目前主流框架大多需要將資料全載入到記憶體方便操作，但這會導致記憶體消耗問題，MiniExcel 嘗試以 Stream 角度寫底層算法邏輯，能讓原本1000多MB占用降低到幾MB，避免記憶體不夠情況。\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/113084691-1804d000-9211-11eb-9b08-cbb89d9ecdc2.png)\n\n### 特點\n- 低記憶體耗用，避免OOM、頻繁 Full GC 情況\n- 支持`即時`操作每行資料\n- 兼具搭配 LINQ 延遲查詢特性，能辦到低消耗、快速分頁等複雜查詢\n- 輕量，不需要安裝 Microsoft Office、COM+，DLL小於150KB\n- 簡便操作的 API 風格\n\n\n\n### 快速開始\n\n- [導入、讀取 Excel](#getstart1)\n- [導出 、創建 Excel](#getstart2)\n- [模板填充、創建 Excel](#getstart3)\n- [Excel Column Name/Index/Ignore Attribute](#getstart4)\n- [例子](#getstart5)\n\n\n### 安裝\n\n請查看 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MiniExcel)\n\n### 更新日誌\n\n請查看 [Release Notes](docs)\n\n### TODO\n\n請查看 [TODO](https://github.com/shps951023/MiniExcel/projects/1?fullscreen=true)\n\n### 性能比較、測試\n\nBenchmarks  邏輯可以在 [MiniExcel.Benchmarks](benchmarks/MiniExcel.Benchmarks/Program.cs) 查看或是提交 PR，運行指令\n\n```bash\ndotnet run -p .\\benchmarks\\MiniExcel.Benchmarks\\ -c Release -f netcoreapp3.1 -- -f * --join\n```\n\n最後一次運行規格、結果 :\n\n```bash\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.12.1, OS=Windows 10.0.19042\nIntel Core i7-7700 CPU 3.60GHz (Kaby Lake), 1 CPU, 8 logical and 4 physical cores\n  [Host]     : .NET

name=\"getstart1\"></a>\n\n- 支持任何 stream 类型 : FileStream,MemoryStream\n\n\n\n#### 1. Query 查詢 Excel 返回`強型別` IEnumerable 資料 [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/w5WD1J)\n\n```csharp\npublic class UserAccount\n{\n    public Guid ID { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public DateTime BoD { get; set; }\n    public int Age { get; set; }\n    public bool VIP { get; set; }\n    public decimal Points { get; set; }\n}\n\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query<UserAccount>(path);\n\n// or\n\nusing (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n    var rows = stream.Query<UserAccount>();\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/111107423-c8c46b80-8591-11eb-982f-c97a2dafb379.png)\n\n\n#### 2. Query 查詢 Excel 返回`Dynamic` IEnumerable 資料 [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/w5WD1J)\n\n* Key 系統預設為 `A,B,C,D...Z`\n\n| MiniExcel     | 1     |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| Github     | 2     |\n\n```csharp\n\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(path).ToList();\n\n// or\nusing (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n{\n    var rows = stream.Query().ToList();\n\n    Assert.Equal(\"MiniExcel\", rows[0].A);\n    Assert.Equal(1, rows[0].B);\n    Assert.Equal(\"Github\", rows[1].A);\n    Assert.Equal(2, rows[1].B);\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. 查詢資料以第一行數據當Key [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/w5WD1J)\n\n注意 : 同名以右邊數據為準\n\nInput Excel :\n\n| Column1 | Column2 |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| MiniExcel     | 1     |\n| Github     | 2     |\n\n\n```csharp\n\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(useHeaderRow:true).ToList();\n\n// or\n\nusing (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n{\n    var rows = stream.Query(useHeaderRow:true).ToList();\n\n    Assert.Equal(\"MiniExcel\", rows[0].Column1);\n    Assert.Equal(1, rows[0].Column2);\n    Assert.Equal(\"Github\", rows[1].Column1);\n    Assert.Equal(2, rows[1].Column2);\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Query 查詢支援延遲加載(Deferred Execution)，能配合LINQ First/Take/Skip辦到低消耗、高效率複雜查詢\n\n舉例 : 查詢第一筆資料\n\n```csharp\nvar row = MiniExcel.Query(path).First();\nAssert.Equal(\"HelloWorld\", row.A);\n\n// or\n\nusing (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n{\n    var row = stream.Query().First();\n    Assert.Equal(\"HelloWorld\", row.A);\n}\n```\n\n與其他框架效率比較 :\n\n![queryfirst](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/111072392-6037a900-8515-11eb-9693-5ce2dad1e460.gif)\n\n#### 5. 查詢指定 Sheet 名稱\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.Query(path, sheetName: \"SheetName\");\n//or\nstream.Query(sheetName: \"SheetName\");\n```\n\n#### 6. 查詢所有 Sheet 名稱跟資料\n\n```csharp\nvar sheetNames = MiniExcel.GetSheetNames(path);\nforeach (var sheetName in sheetNames)\n{\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, sheetName: sheetName);\n}\n```\n\n#### 7. 查詢所有欄(列)\n\n```csharp\nvar columns = MiniExcel.GetColumns(path); // e.g result : [\"A\",\"B\"...]\n\nvar cnt = columns.Count;  // get column count\n```\n\n#### 8. Dynamic Query 轉成 `IDictionary<string,object>` 資料\n\n```csharp\nforeach(IDictionary<string,object> row in MiniExcel.Query(path))\n{\n    //..\n}\n\n// or\nvar rows = MiniExcel.Query(path).Cast<IDictionary<string,object>>();\n// or 査詢指定範圍（要大寫才生效哦）\n// A2（左上角）代表A列的第二行，C3（右下角）代表C列的第三行\n// 如果你不想限制行，就不要包含數位\nvar rows = MiniExcel.QueryRange(path, startCell: \"A2\", endCell: \"C3\").Cast<IDictionary<string, object>>();\n```\n\n\n\n#### 9. Query 讀 Excel 返回 DataTable\n\n提醒 : 不建議使用，因為DataTable會將數據`全載入內存`，失去MiniExcel低記憶體消耗功能。\n\n```C#\nvar table = MiniExcel.QueryAsDataTable(path, useHeaderRow: true);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116673475-07917200-a9d6-11eb-947e-a6f68cce58df.png)\n\n#### 10. 指定單元格開始讀取資料\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.Query(path,useHeaderRow:true,startCell:\"B3\")\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117260316-8593c400-ae81-11eb-9877-c087b7ac2b01.png)\n\n#### 11. 合併的單元格填充\n\n注意 : 效率相對於`沒有使用合併填充`來說差\n底層原因 : OpenXml 標准將 mergeCells 放在文件最下方，導致需要遍歷兩次 sheetxml\n\n```csharp\n    var config = new OpenXmlConfiguration()\n    {\n        FsillMergedCells = true\n    };\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117973630-3527d500-b35f-11eb-95c3-bde255f8114e.png)\n\n支持不固定長寬多行列填充\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117973820-6d2f1800-b35f-11eb-88d8-555063938108.png)\n\n\n#### 12. 讀取大文件硬碟緩存 (Disk-Base Cache - SharedString)\n\n概念 : MiniExcel 當判斷文件 SharedString 大小超過 5MB，預設會使用本地緩存，如 [10x100000.xlsx](https://github.com/MiniExcel/MiniExcel/files/8403819/NotDuplicateSharedStrings_10x100000.xlsx)(一百萬筆數據)，讀取不開啟本地緩存需要最高記憶體使用約195MB，開啟後降為65MB。但要特別注意，此優化是以`時間換取記憶體減少`，所以讀取效率會變慢，此例子讀取時間從 7.4 秒提高到 27.2 秒，假如不需要能用以下代碼關閉硬碟緩存\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration { EnableSharedStringCache = false };\nMiniExcel.Query(path,configuration: config)\n```\n\n也能使用 SharedStringCacheSize 調整 sharedString 文件大小超過指定大小才做硬碟緩存\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration { SharedStringCacheSize=500*1024*1024 };\nMiniExcel.Query(path, configuration: config);\n```\n\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/161411851-1c3f72a7-33b3-4944-84dc-ffc1d16747dd.png)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/161411825-17f53ec7-bef4-4b16-b234-e24799ea41b0.png)\n\n\n\n### 寫/導出 Excel  <a name=\"getstart2\"></a>\n\n1. 必須是非abstract 類別有公開無參數構造函數\n2. MiniExcel SaveAs 支援 `IEnumerable參數延遲查詢`，除非必要請不要使用 ToList 等方法讀取全部資料到記憶體\n\n圖片 : 是否呼叫 ToList 的記憶體差別\n\n#### ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/112587389-752b0b00-8e38-11eb-8a52-cfb76c57e5eb.png)\n\n\n\n#### 1. 支持集合<匿名類別>或是<強型別> [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/w5WD1J)\n\n```csharp\nvar path = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), $\"{Guid.NewGuid()}.xlsx\");\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, new[] {\n    new { Column1 = \"MiniExcel\", Column2 = 1 },\n    new { Column1 = \"Github\", Column2 = 2}\n});\n```\n\n\n\n#### 2. `IEnumerable<IDictionary<string, object>>`\n\n```csharp\nvar values = new List<Dictionary<string, object>>()\n{\n    new Dictionary<string,object>{{ \"Column1\", \"MiniExcel\" }, { \"Column2\", 1 } },\n    new Dictionary<string,object>{{ \"Column1\", \"Github\" }, { \"Column2\", 2 } }\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, values);\n```\n\noutput :\n\n| Column1   | Column2 |\n| --------- | ------- |\n| MiniExcel | 1       |\n| Github    | 2       |\n\n\n\n#### 3.  IDataReader\n\n- 推薦使用，可以避免載入全部數據到記憶體\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, reader);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/121275378-149a5e80-c8bc-11eb-85fe-5453552134f0.png)\n\n推薦 DataReader 多表格導出方式(建議使用 Dapper ExecuteReader )\n\n```csharp\nusing (var cnn = Connection)\n{\n    cnn.Open();\n    var sheets = new Dictionary<string,object>();\n    sheets.Add(\"sheet1\", cnn.ExecuteReader(\"select 1 id\"));\n    sheets.Add(\"sheet2\", cnn.ExecuteReader(\"select 2 id\"));\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(\"Demo.xlsx\", sheets);\n}\n```\n\n\n\n####  4. Datatable\n\n- `不推薦使用`，會將數據全載入記憶體\n- 優先使用 Caption 當欄位名稱\n\n```csharp\nvar path = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), $\"{Guid.NewGuid()}.xlsx\");\nvar table = new DataTable();\n{\n    table.Columns.Add(\"Column1\", typeof(string));\n    table.Columns.Add(\"Column2\", typeof(decimal));\n    table.Rows.Add(\"MiniExcel\", 1);\n    table.Rows.Add(\"Github\", 2);\n}\n\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, table);\n```\n\n####  5. Dapper Query\n\n感謝 @shaofing #552 更正，低內存請使用 `CommandDefinition + CommandFlags.NoCache`，如下\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = GetConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    var rows = connection.Query(\n        new CommandDefinition(\n            @\"select 'MiniExcel' as Column1,1 as Column2 union all select 'Github',2\"\n            , flags: CommandFlags.NoCache)\n        );\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, rows);\n}\n```\n上面的方法已知的問題：不能使用異步QueryAsync的方法，會報連接已經關閉的異常\n\n以下寫法會將數據全載入內存\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = GetConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    var rows = connection.Query(@\"select 'MiniExcel' as Column1,1 as Column2 union all select 'Github',2\");\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, rows);\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### 6. SaveAs 支持 Stream，生成文件不落地 [[Try it]](https://dotnetfiddle.net/JOen0e)\n\n```csharp\nusing (var stream = new MemoryStream()) //支持 FileStream,MemoryStream..等\n{\n    stream.SaveAs(values);\n}\n```\n\n像是 API 導出 Excel\n\n```csharp\npublic IActionResult DownloadExcel()\n{\n    var values = new[] {\n        new { Column1 = \"MiniExcel\", Column2 = 1 },\n        new { Column1 = \"Github\", Column2 = 2}\n    };\n\n    var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\n    memoryStream.SaveAs(values);\n    memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n    return new FileStreamResult(memoryStream, \"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\")\n    {\n        FileDownloadName = \"demo.xlsx\"\n    };\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### 7. 創建多個工作表(Sheet)\n\n```csharp\n// 1. Dictionary<string,object>\nvar users = new[] { new { Name = \"Jack\", Age = 25 }, new { Name = \"Mike\", Age = 44 } };\nvar department = new[] { new { ID = \"01\", Name = \"HR\" }, new { ID = \"02\", Name = \"IT\" } };\nvar sheets = new Dictionary<string, object>\n{\n    [\"users\"] = users,\n    [\"department\"] = department\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, sheets);\n\n// 2. DataSet\nvar sheets = new DataSet();\nsheets.Add(UsersDataTable);\nsheets.Add(DepartmentDataTable);\n//..\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, sheets);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/118130875-6e7c4580-b430-11eb-9b82-22f02716bd63.png)\n\n#### 8. 表格樣式選擇\n\n預設樣式\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/138234373-cfa97109-b71f-4711-b7f5-0eaaa4a0a3a6.png)\n\n不需要樣式\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration()\n{\n    TableStyles = TableStyles.None\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value,configuration:config);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/118784917-f3e57700-b8c2-11eb-8718-8d955b1bc197.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n#### 9. AutoFilter 篩選\n\n從 0.19.0 支持，可藉由 OpenXmlConfiguration.AutoFilter 設定，預設為True。關閉 AutoFilter 方式 :\n\n```csharp\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value, configuration: new OpenXmlConfiguration() { AutoFilter = false });\n```\n\n\n\n#### 10. 圖片生成\n\n```csharp\nvar value = new[] {\n    new { Name=\"github\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/github_logo.png\"))},\n    new { Name=\"google\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/google_logo.png\"))},\n    new { Name=\"microsoft\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/microsoft_logo.png\"))},\n    new { Name=\"reddit\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/reddit_logo.png\"))},\n    new { Name=\"statck_overflow\",Image=File.ReadAllBytes(PathHelper.GetFile(\"images/statck_overflow_logo.png\"))},\n};\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/150462383-ad9931b3-ed8d-4221-a1d6-66f799743433.png)\n\n\n\n#### 11. Byte Array 文件導出\n\n從 1.22.0 開始，當值類型為 `byte[]` 系統預設會轉成保存文件路徑以便導入時轉回 `byte[]`，如不想轉換可以將 `OpenXmlConfiguration.EnableConvertByteArray` 改為 `false`，能提升系統效率。\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/153702334-c3b834f4-6ae4-4ddf-bd4e-e5005d5d8c6a.png)\n\n#### 12. 垂直合併相同的單元格\n\n只支持 `xlsx` 格式合併單元格\n\n```csharp\nvar mergedFilePath = Path.Combine(Path.GetTempPath(), $\"{Guid.NewGuid().ToString()}.xlsx\");\n\nvar path = @\"../../../../../samples/xlsx/TestMergeSameCells.xlsx\";\n\nMiniExcel.MergeSameCells(mergedFilePath, path);\n```\n\n```csharp\nvar memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\n\nvar path = @\"../../../../../samples/xlsx/TestMergeSameCells.xlsx\";\n\nmemoryStream.MergeSameCells(path);\n```\n\n合併前後對比\n\n![before_merge_cells](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38832863/219970175-913b3d04-d714-4279-a7a4-6cefb7aa6ce8.PNG)\n![after_merge_cells](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38832863/219970176-e78c491a-2f90-45a7-a4a2-425c5708d38c.PNG)\n\n\n\n#### 13. 是否寫入 null values cell\n\n預設:\n\n```csharp\nDataTable dt = new DataTable();\n\n/* ... */\n\nDataRow dr = dt.NewRow();\n\ndr[\"Name1\"] = \"Somebody once\";\ndr[\"Name2\"] = null;\ndr[\"Name3\"] = \"told me.\";\n\ndt.Rows.Add(dr);\n\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(@\"C:\\temp\\Book1.xlsx\", dt);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31481586/241419441-c4f27e8f-3f87-46db-a10f-08665864c874.png)\n\n```xml\n<x:row r=\"2\">\n    <x:c r=\"A2\" t =\"str\" s=\"2\">\n        <x:v>Somebody once</x:v>\n    </x:c>\n    <x:c r=\"B2\" t =\"str\" s=\"2\">\n        <x:v></x:v>\n    </x:c>\n    <x:c r=\"C2\" t =\"str\" s=\"2\">\n        <x:v>told me.</x:v>\n    </x:c>\n</x:row>\n```\n\n設定不寫入:\n\n```csharp\nOpenXmlConfiguration configuration = new OpenXmlConfiguration()\n{\n     EnableWriteNullValueCell = false // Default value is true.\n};\n\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(@\"C:\\temp\\Book1.xlsx\", dt, configuration: configuration);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31481586/241419455-3c0aec8a-4e5f-4d83-b7ec-6572124c165d.png)\n\n\n```xml\n<x:row r=\"2\">\n    <x:c r=\"A2\" t =\"str\" s=\"2\">\n        <x:v>Somebody once</x:v>\n    </x:c>\n    <x:c r=\"B2\" s=\"2\"></x:c>\n    <x:c r=\"C2\" t =\"str\" s=\"2\">\n        <x:v>told me.</x:v>\n    </x:c>\n</x:row>\n```\n\n\n\n### 模板填充 Excel <a name=\"getstart3\"></a>\n\n- 宣告方式類似 Vue 模板 `{{變量名稱}}`, 或是集合渲染 `{{集合名稱.欄位名稱}}`\n- 集合渲染支持 IEnumerable/DataTable/DapperRow\n\n\n\n#### 1. 基本填充\n\n模板:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/114537556-ed8d2b00-9c84-11eb-8303-a69f62c41e5b.png)\n\n最終效果:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/114537490-d8180100-9c84-11eb-8c69-db58692f3a85.png)\n\n代碼:\n```csharp\n// 1.

FastMode\n\n系統不會限制記憶體，達到更快的效率\n\n```csharp\nvar config = new OpenXmlConfiguration() { FastMode = true };\nMiniExcel.SaveAs(path, reader,configuration:config);\n```\n\n\n\n### 範例\n\n#### 1. SQLite & Dapper 讀取大數據新增到資料庫\n\nNote : 請不要呼叫 call ToList/ToArray 等方法，這會將所有資料讀到記憶體內\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = new SQLiteConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())\n    using (var stream = File.OpenRead(path))\n    {\n       var rows = stream.Query();\n       foreach (var row in rows)\n             connection.Execute(\"insert into T (A,B) values (@A,@B)\", new { row.A, row.B }, transaction: transaction);\n       transaction.Commit();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n效能:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/111072579-2dda7b80-8516-11eb-9843-c01a1edc88ec.png)\n\n\n#### 2. ASP.NET Core 3.1 or MVC 5 下載/上傳 Excel Xlsx API Demo [Try it](tests/MiniExcel.Tests.AspNetCore)\n\n```csharp\npublic class ApiController : Controller\n{\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        return new ContentResult\n        {\n            ContentType = \"text/html\",\n            StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.OK,\n            Content = @\"<html><body>\n<a href='api/DownloadExcel'>DownloadExcel</a><br>\n<a href='api/DownloadExcelFromTemplatePath'>DownloadExcelFromTemplatePath</a><br>\n<a href='api/DownloadExcelFromTemplateBytes'>DownloadExcelFromTemplateBytes</a><br>\n<p>Upload Excel</p>\n<form method='post' enctype='multipart/form-data' action='/api/uploadexcel'>\n    <input type='file' name='excel'> <br>\n    <input type='submit' >\n</form>\n</body></html>\"\n        };\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult DownloadExcel()\n    {\n        var values = new[] {\n            new { Column1 = \"MiniExcel\", Column2 = 1 },\n            new { Column1 = \"Github\", Column2 = 2}\n        };\n        var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\n        memoryStream.SaveAs(values);\n        memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n        return new FileStreamResult(memoryStream, \"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\")\n        {\n            FileDownloadName = \"demo.xlsx\"\n        };\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult DownloadExcelFromTemplatePath()\n    {\n        string templatePath = \"TestTemplateComplex.xlsx\";\n\n        Dictionary<string, object> value = new Dictionary<string, object>()\n        {\n            [\"title\"] = \"FooCompany\",\n            [\"managers\"] = new[] {\n                new {name=\"Jack\",department=\"HR\"},\n                new {name=\"Loan\",department=\"IT\"}\n            },\n            [\"employees\"] = new[] {\n                new {name=\"Wade\",department=\"HR\"},\n                new {name=\"Felix\",department=\"HR\"},\n                new {name=\"Eric\",department=\"IT\"},\n                new {name=\"Keaton\",department=\"IT\"}\n            }\n        };\n\n        MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\n        memoryStream.SaveAsByTemplate(templatePath, value);\n        memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n        return new FileStreamResult(memoryStream, \"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\")\n        {\n            FileDownloadName = \"demo.xlsx\"\n        };\n    }\n\n    private static Dictionary<string, Byte[]> TemplateBytesCache = new Dictionary<string, byte[]>();\n\n    static ApiController()\n    {\n        string templatePath = \"TestTemplateComplex.xlsx\";\n        byte[] bytes = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(templatePath);\n        TemplateBytesCache.Add(templatePath, bytes);\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult DownloadExcelFromTemplateBytes()\n    {\n        byte[] bytes = TemplateBytesCache[\"TestTemplateComplex.xlsx\"];\n\n        Dictionary<string, object> value = new Dictionary<string, object>()\n        {\n            [\"title\"] = \"FooCompany\",\n            [\"managers\"] = new[] {\n                new {name=\"Jack\",department=\"HR\"},\n                new {name=\"Loan\",department=\"IT\"}\n            },\n            [\"employees\"] = new[] {\n                new {name=\"Wade\",department=\"HR\"},\n                new {name=\"Felix\",department=\"HR\"},\n                new {name=\"Eric\",department=\"IT\"},\n                new {name=\"Keaton\",department=\"IT\"}\n            }\n        };\n\n        MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\n        memoryStream.SaveAsByTemplate(bytes, value);\n        memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\n        return new FileStreamResult(memoryStream, \"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\")\n        {\n            FileDownloadName = \"demo.xlsx\"\n        };\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult UploadExcel(IFormFile excel)\n    {\n        var stream = new MemoryStream();\n        excel.CopyTo(stream);\n\n        foreach (var item in stream.Query(true))\n        {\n            // do your logic etc.\n        }\n\n        return Ok(\"File uploaded successfully\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n####  3. 分頁查詢\n\n```csharp\nvoid Main()\n{\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path);\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"==== No.1 Page ====\");\n    Console.WriteLine(Page(rows,pageSize:3,page:1));\n    Console.WriteLine(\"==== No.50 Page ====\");\n    Console.WriteLine(Page(rows,pageSize:3,page:50));\n    Console.WriteLine(\"==== No.5000 Page ====\");\n    Console.WriteLine(Page(rows,pageSize:3,page:5000));\n}\n\npublic static IEnumerable<T> Page<T>(IEnumerable<T> en, int pageSize, int page)\n{\n    return en.Skip(page * pageSize).Take(pageSize);\n}\n```\n\n![20210419](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/114679083-6ef4c400-9d3e-11eb-9f78-a86daa45fe46.gif)\n\n#### 4. WebForm不落地導出Excel\n\n```csharp\nvar fileName = \"Demo.xlsx\";\nvar sheetName = \"Sheet1\";\nHttpResponse response = HttpContext.Current.Response;\nresponse.Clear();\nresponse.ContentType = \"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\";\nresponse.AddHeader(\"Content-Disposition\", $\"attachment;filename=\\\"{fileName}\\\"\");\nvar values = new[] {\n    new { Column1 = \"MiniExcel\", Column2 = 1 },\n    new { Column1 = \"Github\", Column2 = 2}\n};\nvar memoryStream = new MemoryStream();\nmemoryStream.SaveAs(values, sheetName: sheetName);\nmemoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);\nmemoryStream.CopyTo(Response.OutputStream);\nresponse.End();\n```\n\n#### 5. 動態 i18n 多國語言跟權限管理\n\n像例子一樣，建立一個方法處理 i18n 跟權限管理，並搭配 `yield return 返回 IEnumerable<Dictionary<string, object>>`，即可達到動態、低記憶體處理效果\n\n```csharp\nvoid Main()\n{\n    var value = new Order[] {\n        new Order(){OrderNo = \"SO01\",CustomerID=\"C001\",ProductID=\"P001\",Qty=100,Amt=500},\n        new Order(){OrderNo = \"SO02\",CustomerID=\"C002\",ProductID=\"P002\",Qty=300,Amt=400},\n    };\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"en-Us and Sales role\");\n    {\n        var path = Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid() + \".xlsx\";\n        var lang = \"en-US\";\n        var role = \"Sales\";\n        MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, GetOrders(lang, role, value));\n        MiniExcel.Query(path, true).Dump();\n    }\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"zh-CN and PMC role\");\n    {\n        var path = Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid() + \".xlsx\";\n        var lang = \"zh-CN\";\n        var role = \"PMC\";\n        MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, GetOrders(lang, role, value));\n        MiniExcel.Query(path, true).Dump();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate IEnumerable<Dictionary<string, object>> GetOrders(string lang, string role, Order[] orders)\n{\n    foreach (var order in orders)\n    {\n        var newOrder = new Dictionary<string, object>();\n\n        if (lang == \"zh-CN\")\n        {\n            newOrder.Add(\"客戶編號\", order.CustomerID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"訂單編號\", order.OrderNo);\n            newOrder.Add(\"產品編號\", order.ProductID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"數量\", order.Qty);\n            if (role == \"Sales\")\n                newOrder.Add(\"價格\", order.Amt);\n            yield return newOrder;\n        }\n        else if (lang == \"en-US\")\n        {\n            newOrder.Add(\"Customer ID\", order.CustomerID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"Order No\", order.OrderNo);\n            newOrder.Add(\"Product ID\", order.ProductID);\n            newOrder.Add(\"Quantity\", order.Qty);\n            if (role == \"Sales\")\n                newOrder.Add(\"Amount\", order.Amt);\n            yield return newOrder;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new InvalidDataException($\"lang {lang} wrong\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Order\n{\n    public string OrderNo { get; set; }\n    public string CustomerID { get; set; }\n    public decimal Qty { get; set; }\n    public string ProductID { get; set; }\n    public decimal Amt { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/118939964-d24bc480-b982-11eb-88dd-f06655f6121a.png)\n\n\n\n### FAQ 常見問題\n\n#### Q: Excel 表頭標題名稱跟 class 屬性名稱不一致，如何對應?\n\nA. 請使用 ExcelColumnName 作 mapping\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116020475-eac50980-a678-11eb-8804-129e87200e5e.png)\n\n\n\n#### Q. 多工作表(sheet)如何導出/查詢資料?\n\nA. 使用 `GetSheetNames `方法搭配 Query 的 sheetName 參數\n\n\n\n```csharp\nvar sheets = MiniExcel.GetSheetNames(path);\nforeach (var sheet in sheets)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"sheet name : {sheet} \");\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path,useHeaderRow:true,sheetName:sheet);\n    Console.WriteLine(rows);\n}\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/116199841-2a1f5300-a76a-11eb-90a3-6710561cf6db.png)\n\n\n\n#### Q. 是否使用 Count 會載入全部數據到記憶體\n\n不會，圖片測試一百萬行*十列資料，簡單測試，內存最大使用 < 60MB，花費13.65秒\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/117118518-70586000-adc3-11eb-9ce3-2ba76cf8b5e5.png)\n\n#### Q. Query如何使用整數索引取值?\n\nQuery 預設索引為字串Key : A,B,C....，想要改為數字索引，請建立以下方法自行轉換\n\n```csharp\nvoid Main()\n{\n    var path = @\"D:\\git\\MiniExcel\\samples\\xlsx\\TestTypeMapping.xlsx\";\n    var rows = MiniExcel.Query(path,true);\n    foreach (var r in ConvertToIntIndexRows(rows))\n    {\n        Console.Write($\"column 0 : {r[0]} ,column 1 : {r[1]}\");\n        Console.WriteLine();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate IEnumerable<Dictionary<int, object>> ConvertToIntIndexRows(IEnumerable<object> rows)\n{\n    ICollection<string> keys = null;\n    var isFirst = true;\n    foreach (IDictionary<string,object> r in rows)\n    {\n        if(isFirst)\n        {\n            keys = r.Keys;\n            isFirst = false;\n        }\n\n        var dic = new Dictionary<int, object>();\n        var index = 0;\n        foreach (var key in keys)\n            dic[index++] = r[key];\n        yield return dic;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Q. 導出時數組為空時生成沒有標題空 Excel\n\n因為 MiniExcel 使用類似 JSON.NET 動態從值獲取類別機制簡化 API 操作，沒有數據就無法獲取類別。可以查看[ issue #133](https://github.com/shps951023/MiniExcel/issues/133) 了解。\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/122639771-546c0c00-d12e-11eb-800c-498db27889ca.png)\n\n> 強型別和 DataTable 會生成表頭，但 Dicionary 依舊是空 Excel\n\n#### Q. 如何人為空白行中止遍歷?\n\n常發生人為不小心在最後幾行留下空白行情況，MiniExcel可以搭配 `LINQ TakeWhile`實現空白行中斷遍歷。\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/130209137-162621c2-f337-4479-9996-beeac65bc4d4.png)\n\n#### Q. 不想要空白行如何去除?\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/137873865-7107d8f5-eb59-42db-903a-44e80589f1b2.png)\n\n\nIEnumerable版本\n\n```csharp\npublic static IEnumerable<dynamic> QueryWithoutEmptyRow(Stream stream, bool useHeaderRow, string sheetName, ExcelType excelType, string startCell, IConfiguration configuration)\n{\n    var rows = stream.Query(useHeaderRow,sheetName,excelType,startCell,configuration);\n    foreach (IDictionary<string,object> row in rows)\n    {\n        if(row.Keys.Any(key=>row[key]!=null))\n            yield return row;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nDataTable版本\n\n```csharp\npublic static DataTable QueryAsDataTableWithoutEmptyRow(Stream stream, bool useHeaderRow, string sheetName, ExcelType excelType, string startCell, IConfiguration configuration)\n{\n    if (sheetName == null && excelType != ExcelType.CSV) /*Issue #279*/\n        sheetName = stream.GetSheetNames().First();\n\n    var dt = new DataTable(sheetName);\n    var first = true;\n    var rows = stream.Query(useHeaderRow,sheetName,excelType,startCell,configuration);\n    foreach (IDictionary<string, object> row in rows)\n    {\n        if (first)\n        {\n\n            foreach (var key in row.Keys)\n            {\n                var column = new DataColumn(key, typeof(object)) { Caption = key };\n                dt.Columns.Add(column);\n            }\n\n            dt.BeginLoadData();\n            first = false;\n        }\n\n        var newRow = dt.NewRow();\n        var isNull=true;\n        foreach (var key in row.Keys)\n        {\n            var _v = row[key];\n            if(_v!=null)\n                isNull = false;\n            newRow[key] = _v;\n        }\n\n        if(!isNull)\n            dt.Rows.Add(newRow);\n    }\n\n    dt.EndLoadData();\n    return dt;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### Q. 保存如何取代MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value)，文件存在系統會報已存在錯誤?\n\n請改以Stream自行管控Stream行為，如\n\n```C#\n    using (var stream = File.Create(\"Demo.xlsx\"))\n        MiniExcel.SaveAs(stream,value);\n```\n\n\n\n從V1.25.0版本開始，支持 overwriteFile 參數，方便調整是否要覆蓋已存在文件\n\n```csharp\n    MiniExcel.SaveAs(path, value, overwriteFile: true);\n```\n\n\n\n### 侷限與警告\n\n- 目前不支援 xls (97-2003) 或是加密檔案\n- xlsm 只支持查詢\n\n\n\n### 參考\n\n[ExcelDataReader](https://github.com/ExcelDataReader/ExcelDataReader)  / [ClosedXML](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML) / [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper) / [ExcelNumberFormat](https://github.com/andersnm/ExcelNumberFormat)\n\n\n\n### 感謝名單\n\n####  [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)\n\n![jetbrains-variant-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/123997015-8456c180-da02-11eb-829a-aec476fe8e94.png)\n\n感謝提供免費IDE支持此專案 ([License](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/123988233-6ab17c00-d9fa-11eb-8739-2a08c6a4a263.png))\n\n### 收益流水\n目前收益 https://github.com/mini-software/MiniExcel/issues/560#issue-2080619180\n\n\n\n### Contributors\n\n![](https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=shps951023/MiniExcel)"
