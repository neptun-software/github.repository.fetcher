Currently building against Steamworks SDK 1.60.\n\n* Author: [Riley Labrecque](https://github.com/rlabrecque)\n* License: [MIT](https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n* [Documentation](https://steamworks.github.io/)\n* [Discussion Thread](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/discussions/0/666827974770212954/)\n* [Reporting Issues](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/issues)\n  Note that only Steamworks.NET specific issues should be reported, general API questions/issues should be asked on the [Steamworks discussion board](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/discussions).\n\n[![Support via Paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YFZZER8VNXKRC)\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can find the installation instructions [here](https://steamworks.github.io/installation/).\n\n## Samples\n\nCheck out these sample projects to get started:\n\n* [Steamworks.NET Example](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-Example)\n* [Steamworks.NET Test](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-Test)\n* [Steamworks.NET ChatClient](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-ChatClient)\n* [Steamworks.NET GameServerTest](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-GameServerTest)\n"
