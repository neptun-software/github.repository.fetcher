If you change them, please make sure your changed files are formatted correctly.\n\nMake sure clang-format version 12.0.0 and above version is used.\n\n### IDE integration\nClangFormat describes a set of tools that are built on top of LibFormat. It can support your workflow in a variety of ways including a standalone tool and editor integrations. For details, refer to https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html\n\n### Format with script\nTwo scripts are provided to help you format files.\n- Windows user only: use FormatSource.ps1. This script use clang-format.exe which is built into Visual Studio by default.\n\n\tExecute below command in the root folder of the project\n\n\t```\n\tPowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass scripts\\FormatSource.ps1 -ModifiedOnly $False\n\t```\n\nIf it's the first time to run the script, make sure clang-format version 12.0.0 or above in the output. Otherwise you may need to upgrade Visual Studio or use your own clang-format binaries.\n```\n[clang-format] Version is:\nclang-format version 12.0.0\n```\n\n- Both Windows and MAC users: Use clang-format npmjs package\n\n\tExecute below command in source/nodejs\n\n\t```\n\tnpm run format\n\t``` \n\nMake sure `npm install` is run before.\n\n### Use Git pre-commit hook\n`git pre-commit hook` is an optional process. When you run `git commit`, it will automatically do the format check and auto fix the format if error detected.\n\nFirst make sure clang-format binary is installed in your dev enviroment.\nThen modify scripts/hooks/pre-commit to make sure clangFormat is point to the correct path.\nAnd finally setup the git hook.\n\nTwo ways to setup the hook:\n1. Copy `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` to `.git/hooks`\n2. `git config --local core.hooksPath scripts/hooks`\n\n## End User License Agreement for our binary packages\nConsumption of the AdaptiveCards binary packages are subject to the Microsoft EULA (End User License Agreement).

These releases are a good choice for applications in active development, giving you access to the latest features and improvements. You need to upgrade to later releases more often to stay in support. Current releases are typically supported for 3 months after a subsequent Current or LTS release.\n- **Maintenance** releases are in the last stage of the lifecycle. During Maintenance, a release will receive security updates and critical functionality issues.\n- **Community** releases are not officially supported by Microsoft and are actively maintained by the community and third-parties. In most cases they are in active development and bugs are addressed where possible.\n\nCurrent and Maintenance releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security or reliability. You must stay up to date with the latest patches to qualify for support.\n\n## End of support\n\nEnd of support refers to the date when Microsoft no longer provides fixes, updates, or online technical assistance. End of support may also be referred to as \"end of life\" or abbreviated \"EOL\". This is the time to make sure you have the latest available update installed.\n\nUpdates are cumulative, with each update built upon all of the updates that preceded it. A device needs to install the latest update to remain supported. Updates may include new features, fixes (security and/or non-security), or a combination of both. Not all features in an update will work on all devices. Update availability may vary, for example by country, region, network connectivity, or hardware capabilities (including, for example, free disk space).\n\n## Out of support versions\n\nVersions `1.x` of the **Renderer** and **Serialization** libraries are no longer supported. Please upgrade to the `2.x` releases.\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
