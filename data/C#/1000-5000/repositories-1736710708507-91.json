You can\ncontrol the Editor using natural language prompts.\n\n## How to try it\n\nYou have to generate an API key to use the ChatGPT API. Please generate it on\nyour [account page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and set it on\nthe Project Settings page (Edit > Project Settings > AI Command > API Key).\n\n**CAUTION** - The API key is stored in `UserSettings/AICommandSettings.asset`.\nYou must exclude the directory when sharing your project with others.\n\nYou can open the AI Command window from Window > AI Command.\n\n## System requirements\n\nUnity 2022.2 or later\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### Is it practical?\n\n**Definitely no!** I created this proof-of-concept and proved that it doesn't\nwork yet. It works nicely in some cases and fails very poorly in others. I got\nseveral ideas from those successes and failures, which is this project's main\naim.\n\n### Can I install this to my project?\n\nThis is just a proof-of-concept project, so there is no standard way to install\nit in other projects. If you want to try it with your project anyway, you can\nsimply copy the `Assets/Editor` directory to your project.\n\n### AICommandWindow throws NullReferenceException\n\nProbably your OpenAI trial period has expired. Please check your billing status.\nSee [AIShader issue #1] for details.\n\n[AIShader Issue #1]: https://github.com/keijiro/AIShader/issues/1\n\n### I pressed the \"Run\" button, resulting in compilation errors.\n\nIn many cases, ChatGPT fails to implement your command correctly. You might get\nthe correct one by repeatedly pressing the \"Run\" button.\n\n(That's why I think this PoC is impractical...)\n"
