the 1.2 and includes the following in preparation for the next LTS:\n* OS support changes\n* System modules based on .NET 6 with Alpine as the base layer\n* Required use of TLS 1.2 by default\n* Ability to configure device identity, EST identity, and Edge CA certificate auto-renewal before expiration using `config.toml`, addresses https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/issues/5787, https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/issues/5788, and https://github.com/Azure/iot-identity-service/issues/300\n* Added a check for `iotedge config apply` to detect hostname changes to prevent mismatch between configuration and _edgeHub_ server certificate, addresses https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/issues/5773 and https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/issues/6276\n* Updates to the rust-based components to use tokio 1.0\n* Various bug fixes\n\n**With this release the 1.2.x is no longer serviced with bug fixes and security patches.**\n\n## Upgrade notes\n\n### Require TLS 1.2 by default\n\nYou can configure Edge Hub to still accept TLS 1.0 or 1.1 connections via the [SslProtocols environment variable](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/main/doc/EnvironmentVariables.md#edgehub).  Please note that support for [TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in IoT Hub is considered legacy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-tls-deprecating-1-0-and-1-1) and may also be removed from Edge Hub in future releases. To avoid future issues, use TLS 1.2 as the only TLS version when connecting to Edge Hub or IoT Hub.\n\n### MQTT broker preview removed\n\nThe preview for the experimental MQTT broker in Edge Hub 1.2 has ended and is not included in Edge Hub 1.3. We are continuing to refine our plans for an MQTT broker based on feedback received. In the meantime, if you need a standards-compliant MQTT broker on IoT Edge, consider deploying an open-source broker like [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) as an IoT Edge module.\n\n### Certificate renewal feature detail\n\nYou can have IoT Edge proactively renew device identity (for authentication to IoT Hub and DPS), Edge CA, and EST identity certificates by configuring a few basic options in the `config.toml`. Use this feature along with an EST server like [GlobalSign IoT Edge Enroll](https://www.globalsign.com/en/iot-edge-enroll) or [DigiCert IoT Device Manager](https://www.digicert.com/iot/iot-device-manager) to automate certificate renewals customized to your needs.\n\nFor example, adding the below configuration enables device identity certificate auto-renewal when the certificate is at 80% of its lifetime, retry at increment of 4% of lifetime, and rotate the private key:\n\n```\n[provisioning.attestation.identity_cert.auto_renew]\nrotate_key = true\nthreshold = \"80%\"\nretry = \"4%\"\n```\n\nTo enable the certificate renewal feature, changes were made to consolidate and improve IoT Edge's certificate management system. There are some important differences in 1.3 compared to 1.2:\n- All modules restart when Edge CA certificate is renewed. This is necessary so that each module receives the updated trust bundle with the new CA certificate. By default, and when there's no specific `auto_renew` configuration, Edge CA renews at 80% certificate lifetime and so modules would restart at that time.\n- The device identity certificate no longer renews when reprovisioned within 1 day of certificate expiry. This old behavior in 1.2 is removed because it causes authentication errors with IoT Hub or DPS when using X.509 thumbprint authentication, since the new certificate comes with a new thumbprint that the user must manually update in Azure. In 1.3, device identity automatic renewal must be explicitly enabled similar to example above and should only be used with DPS X.509 CA authentication.\n- The device identity certificate no longer renews when reprovisioned after certificate expiry. The reason for this change is same as above: device identity certificates do not renew by default since it causes issues with X.509 thumbprint authentication. \n\n## OS support\n* Adding RedHat Enterprise Linux 8 for AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures.\n* Adding Debian 11 (Bullseye) for ARM32v7 ( [Generally available: Azure IoT Edge supports Debian Bullseye on ARM32v7](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-iot-edge-supports-debian-bullseye-arm32v7/) )\n\n### Retirement\n* Debian 9 (Stretch) for ARMHF ( [Update your IoT Edge devices on Raspberry Pi OS Stretch](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/update-rpios-stretch-to-latest/) )\n\n### Compatibility script (Under development)\nThe IoT Edge compatibility script performs a variety of checks to determine whether a platform has the necessary capabilities to run IoT Edge. This stand-alone script is still considered under development, but we invite anyone to give it a try and send us your feedback by posting in the Issues. Go [here ](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/main/platform-validation/docs/aziot-compatibility-get-started.md) to learn more about the checks it performs and how to use it.\n\n### Known issue: Debian 10 (Buster) on ARMv7\nWe recommend using Bullseye instead of Buster as the host OS.  Seccomp on Buster may not be aware of new system calls used by your container resulting in crashes.\n\nIf you need to use Buster, then apply the following workaround to change the default seccomp profile for Moby's `defaultAction` to `SCMP_ACT_TRACE`:\n1. Make sure you are runing latest docker and latest seccomp package from oldstable channel\n2. Download [Moby's default seccomp profile](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json) and put it somewhere. \n4. On line 2 change the value for _defaultAction_ from `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` to `SCMP_ACT_TRACE`\n5. Edit file _/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service_ to have it contain: `--seccomp-profile=/path/to/default.json`\n6. Restart your container engine by running:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n   sudo systemctl restart docker\n   ```\n\n\n## Edge Agent\n* Remove unused plan runner and planner  ( [2159dfad3](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/2159dfad36f04c61ed1df6df4afd69ea57439650) )\n* Flatten additional properties of metrics  ( [dbc6af347](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/dbc6af347adef00a3091be7ae188a1c75fb58181) )\n* Update Device SDK to the latest LTS version  ( [90e5b3264](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/90e5b3264ac0befe1eeebce898f01635f4ac7d14) )\n* Update ARM32 and ARM64 images to use Alpine  ( [059aaea2d](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/059aaea2d23d11bfb5b46dac3b28f9a563395647) )\n* Migrate to Dotnet 6  ( [37234e02b](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/37234e02b500e6930d389275ac09a5aee80f7445) )\n* Device product information  ( [9faf5a5c0](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/9faf5a5c09fd3ef058201075f813da2a0a81cdd6) )\n* Update references to the default branch  ( [04ee9751f](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/04ee9751f08691b1bff157829a1498fc71998ab5) )\n* Update Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client from 1.36.3 to 1.36.4  ( [19beaae55](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/19beaae556897a2b0676c455523df136ea016e73) )\n* Remove k8s projects from master  ( [d81a032bc](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/d81a032bcb740bccccff3a13c809547d2ca62362) )\n* Fix underflow possibility on ColumnFamilyDbStore  ( [bc78f1c](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/bc78f1c0b0ab0dfa305b817c030b82cea035f6e0) )\n* Remove BouncyCastle dependency  ( [aa2237988](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/aa22379885dff7cbb89cbdf1e4c870460f6f5576) )\n* Fix Workload socket issue for concurrent module create  ( [26bbf7145](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/26bbf7145b1cd76fd55cb7b7d990a3907616ac5a) )\n* Handle Return Code From Get Module Logs Failure  ( [5015eca6d](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/5015eca6d497e317a28ed0dc3bc013315c34b53b) )\n* Update SDK from 1.36.2 to 1.36.3 to fix connectivity issues  ( [865b275b4](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/865b275b4703cd6c41c2f63623994b133d3e3827) )\n* Restrict EdgeAgent parallel calls to edged to 5   ( [3bb4c8f7f](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/3bb4c8f7fc2bb90a5db6c26d36d16f8fbc3b3c50) )\n* Recreate edgeAgent when not `Running`, `Stopped`, or `Failed`  ( [6b21874fe](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/6b21874fee75ef49d497b5f635048e34a7f2ca9f) )\n* Add `RocksDB_MaxManifestFileSize` env var  ( [2c878635c](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/2c878635c75d3eaddd55c06ae5fd9229d9fe463b) )\n* Update SDK references to fix `Dotnetty` bug  ( [0750a4414](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/0750a44146c81ea3cce9bc447016b535612502fc) )\n* Update k8s client  ( [edad631d7](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/edad631d7d2d3b0043b59e652577055efb30d783) )\n* Fix edgeAgent creates rogue `ModuleClients` in case of error  ( [e3892eb4a](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/e3892eb4aae8b59bf9f5be02a34af693f9f23dc9) )\n* Fix various RUSTSEC  ( [89917f1bb](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/commit/89917f1bb59fe98c9872c16aea5cab855fa6e139) )\n* Make sure to dispose `HttpContentStream` when done reading module logs.

It separates out the daemon's functionality for provisioning and providing cryptographic services for Linux-based devices into a set of stand-alone system services. Details on these individual system services can be found in the [Overview](https://azure.github.io/iot-identity-service) of the related github repository in which they reside.\n\n### Impact to Edge modules\nEvery attempt has been made to ensure that the APIs on which Edge modules depend will remain unaffected and backward compatible. Issues affecting Edge modules will be treated with the highest priority.\n\n### Impact to installing / configuring IoT Edge\nThe refactoring does affect the packaging and installation of IoT Edge. While we've attempted to minimize the impact of these there are expected differences. For more details on these changes please refer to the discussion of [Packaging](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/main/doc/packaging.md).\n\n\n## Edge Agent\n### Bug Fixes\n* Update Base Images

SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.

APPLICABLE LAW.\na.    United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.\nb.    Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.\n10.  LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights.

Si votre pays nâautorise pas lâexclusion ou la limitation de responsabilitÃ© pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou lâexclusion ci-dessus ne sâappliquera pas Ã  votre Ã©gard.\nEFFET JURIDIQUE. Le prÃ©sent contrat dÃ©crit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir dâautres droits prÃ©vus par les lois de votre pays. Le prÃ©sent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confÃ¨rent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.\n\n***\n\nmgeisler/textwrap\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Martin Geisler\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\nthe right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\nmoral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\npublicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\nrights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\nrights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\ndatabase rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\nother similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\nNo trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\nAffirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\nAffirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\nAffirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.\n\n***\n\ncore-foundation-rs\nCopyright (c) 2012-2013 Mozilla Foundation\nPortions Copyright 2013 The Servo Project Developers\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By downloading or using this software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this License, please do not download or use the software.\n1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other work which Apple Computer, Inc. (\"Apple\") makes publicly available and which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or work as \"Original Code\" and stating that it is subject to the terms of this Apple Public Source License version 2.0 (\"License\"). As used in this License:\n1.1 \"Applicable Patent Rights\" mean: (a) in the case where Apple is the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.\n1.2 \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that creates orcontributes to the creation of Modifications.\n1.3 \"Covered Code\" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.\n1.4 \"Externally Deploy\" means: (a) to sublicense, distribute or otherwise make Covered Code available, directly or indirectly, to anyone other than You; and/or (b) to use Covered Code, alone or as part of a Larger Work, in any way to provide a service, including but not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication\nwith a client other than You.\n1.5 \"Larger Work\" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\n1.6 \"Modifications\" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is released as a series of files, a Modification is: (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.\n1.7 \"Original Code\" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as originally made available by Apple under this License, including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and originally made available by Apple under this License.\n1.8 \"Source Code\" means the human readable form of a program or other work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable (object code).\n1.9 \"You\" or \"Your\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this License. For legal entities, \"You\" or \"Your\" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where \"control\" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,\nwhether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.\n2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:\n2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:\n(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.\n2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions:\n(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code;\n(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and\n(c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in\nthis License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).\n2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the\nterms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.\n2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\nproperty rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.\n4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.\n5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole\nresponsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and  You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.\n7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \"APPLE\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.\nYou acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this\nLicense exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\n10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names \"Apple\", \"Apple Computer\", \"Mac\", \"Mac OS\", \"QuickTime\", \"QuickTime  Streaming Server\" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively \"Apple Marks\") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.\n11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple (\"Apple Modifications\"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\n12. Termination.\n12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:\n(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during\nthe term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.\n12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\n13. Miscellaneous.\n13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.\n13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may\ndevelop, produce, market or distribute.\n13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\n13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of\nthe Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\n13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rediges en anglais.\nEXHIBIT A.\n\"Portions Copyright (c) 1999-2003 Apple Computer, Inc.
