          "content": "# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\n\n## [Unreleased]\n\n## [25.1.0] - 2025-01-10\n### Added\n- Add `Reset All Playouts` button to top of playouts page\n- Add `rewind_on_reset` option to `wait_until` YAML playout instruction\n  - This option allows YAML playouts to start in the past\n- Add `advance` option to `epg_group` YAML playout instruction\n  - When set to `false`, this option will lock the guide group without starting a new guide group\n  - This can be helpful for \"post roll\" items that should be part of the previous item's guide group\n- Add `Song Video Mode` to channel settings\n  - `Default` - existing behavior\n  - `With Progress` - show animated progress bar at bottom of generated video\n    - Thanks to @JeckDev for the idea and the artwork\n- Add fallback album art image for songs that have no album art\n- Add `Vaapi Display` option to FFmpeg Profile\n  - Possible values will be install-specific and sourced from `vainfo`\n  - `drm` was the previous default value, and should be used in most cases\n- Test all `Vaapi Display` values in `Troubleshooting` > `VAAPI Capabilities`\n- Add `tag_full` field to search index\n  - This field contains the same values as the existing `tag` field, but it is not analyzed or tokenized\n\n### Changed\n- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Change channel identifiers used in XMLTV to work around bad behavior in Plex\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix startup error with MySql backend caused by database cleaner\n- Fix emptying trash with ElasticSearch backend\n- Fix double loading of trash UI elements, and fix reloading of all UI elements after emptying trash\n- Fix destroying channel preview player when preview dialog is closed\n  - This bug made it difficult to \"stop\" a channel after previewing it\n- Fix bug where deco default filler would never use hardware acceleration\n- Fix deleting local libraries with MySql backend\n- Fix `Scaling Behavior` `Crop` when content is smaller than FFmpeg Profile resolution\n  - Now, content will properly scale beyond the desired resolution before cropping\n- Fix displaying playout item durations that are greater than 24 hours\n- Fix building playouts when playlist has been changed to have fewer items\n- Fix selecting audio stream with preferred title\n- Fix synchronizing Plex collections\n  - If this breaks collection sync for you, you will need to update your Plex server\n- Fix guide group generation for `duration` YAML instructions\n- Fix default song background when targeting 4:3 resolutions\n  - Previously the background was always 16:9 and was padded, now it will fill 4:3\n\n## [0.8.8-beta] - 2024-09-19\n### Added\n- Add support for Plex Other Video libraries\n  - These libraries will now appear as ETV Other Video libraries\n  - Items in these libraries will have tag metadata added from folders just like local Other Video libraries\n  - Thanks @raknam for adding this feature!\n- Add *experimental* support for `On Demand` channel progress\n  - With `On Demand` channel progress, the playout will only advance when the channel is being streamed\n  - When the channel is idle, the playout is unmodified and will be shifted forward as needed so no content is missed\n  - Setting a channel to `On Demand` progress will disable alternate schedules\n  - The `On Demand` setting will only be used for `Flood` playouts (NOT `Block` or `External JSON`)\n  - It is NOT recommended to use fixed start times with `On Demand` progress\n    - This will probably be disabled with a future update\n- Add `Default Filler` to `Deco` system\n  - After all blocks are scheduled/added to the playout, a second pass will be made to insert filler\n  - Default filler will be shuffled and inserted in all unscheduled time between blocks\n  - Default filler will stop scheduling when the next item would extend into primary content\n  - Alternatively, default filler can be configured to `Trim To Fit`\n    - In this case, the last item that would extend into primary content is trimmed to end exactly when the primary content starts\n- Add **experimental** playout type `YAML`\n  - This playout type uses a YAML file to declare content and describe how the playout should be built\n  - Content currently supports search queries\n  - Playout instructions currently include `count`, `pad to next`, and `repeat`\n    - `count`: add the specified number of items (from the referenced content) to the playout\n    - `duration`: play the referenced content for the specified duration\n    - `pad to next`: add items from the referenced content until the wall clock is a multiple of the specified minutes value\n    - `repeat`: continue building the playout from the first instruction in the YAML file\n- Add channel logo generation by @raknam\n  - Channels without custom uploaded logos will automatically generate a logo that includes the channel name\n- Add two new API endpoints\n  - Reset playout for channel\n    - POST `/api/channels/{channelNumber}/playout/reset`\n  - Scan library\n    - POST `/api/libraries/{libraryId}/scan`\n- Add Deco setting to `Use Watermark During Filler`\n  - This setting is turned OFF by default, meaning filler will NOT use the configured watermark unless this is manually turned on\n- Add `Random Count` filler mode by @embolon\n  - This mode will randomly schedule between zero and the provided count number of items\n  - e.g. random count 3 will schedule between 0 and 3 filler items\n- Add `Random Rotation` playback order for block scheduling by @embolon\n  - This playback order will pick a random item from a randomly selected group (show or artist)\n  - It is somewhat similar to the `Fill With Group` mode used in flood scheduling\n\n### Fixed\n- Add basic cache busting to XMLTV image URLs\n  - This should help with clients not showing correct channel logos or posters\n- Fix artwork in other video libraries by @raknam\n- Fix adding items to empty playlists\n- Fix filler preset editor and deco dead air fallback editor to only show supported collection types\n- Fix infinite loop caused by impossible schedule (all collection items longer than schedule item duration)\n- Fix selecting audio and subtitle streams with two-letter language codes\n- Fix adding pad filler to content that is less than one minute in duration\n- Generate unique identifier for virtual HDHomeRun tuner by @raknam\n  - This allows a single Plex server to connect to multiple ETV instances\n- Include *all* language codes from media library in preferred audio and subtitle language options\n  - Language codes where an English name cannot be found will be at the bottom of the list\n- Fix local libraries to detect external subtitle files with unrecognized language codes\n- Fix playback selection of subtitles with unrecognized language codes\n- Fix incorrectly removing block items that are hidden from EPG when deco filler is applied\n- Fix deco selection when deco is scheduled until midnight\n  - Previously, this deco item would be ignored so watermark and filler would be missing\n- Fix movies with missing medata by generating fallback metadata\n  - This allows these movies to appear in the Trash where they can be deleted\n- Fix synchronizing trakt lists from users with special characters in their username\n  - Note that these lists MUST be added as URLs; the short-form `user/list` will NOT work with special characters\n- Fix local subtitle scanner to detect non-lowercase extensions (e.g. `Movie (2000).EN.SRT`)\n- Fix adding a single image to a manual collection from search results\n- Fix loading manual collection view when collection contains images\n- Fix edge case where block playout history would get stuck and repeat an item\n- Fix adjusting watermark opacity when watermark already contains alpha channel (is already transparent)\n\n### Changed\n- Remove some unnecessary API calls related to media server scanning and paging\n- Improve trakt list URL validation; non-trakt URLs will no longer be requested\n- Prevent saving block templates when blocks are overlapping\n  - This can happen if block durations are changed for blocks that are already on the template\n- Redirect variant playlist request to proper URL for starting `HLS Segmenter` session when no session is active\n  - This can happen when some clients \"pause\" long enough for the session to stop in ETV\n  - When the client resumes playback, it requests the temp playlist URL which is now invalid e.g. `/iptv/session/1/hls.m3u8` (not the original URL `/iptv/channel/1.m3u8`)\n  - To fix, the client will be redirected back to the original URL in this case which will create a new session\n\n## [0.8.7-beta] - 2024-06-26\n### Added\n- Add `Active Date Range` to block playout template editor to allow limiting templates to a specific date range\n  - This is year-agnostic, meaning the Month/Day range will apply to every year\n  - This also supports wrapping the end of the year (e.g., start 12/1 and end 1/15)\n- Add new `Deco` system for \"decorating\" channels with non-primary content\n  - Decos currently contain\n    - Watermarks\n    - Dead Air Fallback (i.e. fallback filler)\n  - Similar to blocks, decos have deco groups for organization\n  - Similar to blocks, decos have deco templates for filling a \"day\" with decos\n  - In the playout template editor, playout template items can have *both* a block template and a deco template\n    - This allows watermarks and dead air fallback to change at different times than primary content\n  - Block playouts can also have a default deco\n    - This will apply whenever a deco template is missing, or when a deco template item cannot be found for the current time\n    - Effectively, this sets a default watermark and dead air fallback for the entire playout\n- Add `XMLTV Days To Build` setting, which is distinct from the existing `Playout Days To Build` setting\n  - The value for `XMLTV Days To Build` cannot be larger than `Playout Days To Build`\n  - This allows, for example, a week of playout data while optimizing XMLTV data to only a day or two\n- Add health check to detect config folder issue on MacOS\n  - ETV versions through v0.8.4-beta (using dotnet 7) stored config data in `$HOME/.local/share/ersatztv`\n  - ETV versions starting with v0.8.5-beta (using dotnet 8) store config data in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/ersatztv`\n  - If a dotnet 8 version of ETV has NOT been launched on MacOS, it will automatically migrate the config folder on startup\n  - If a dotnet 8 version of ETV *has* been launched on MacOS, a failing health check will display with instructions on how to resolve the config issue to restore data\n- Add `Video Profile` setting to `FFmpeg Profile` editor when `h264` format is selected\n- Add `Video Preset` setting to `FFmpeg Profile` editor for some combinations of acceleration and video format:\n  - `Nvenc` / `h264`\n  - `Nvenc` / `hevc`\n  - `Qsv` / `h264`\n  - `Qsv` / `hevc`\n  - `None` / `h264`\n  - `None` / `hevc`\n- Add *experimental* list type `Playlist`\n  - Playlists contain an ordered list of:\n    - Collections\n    - Multi-Collections\n    - Smart Collections\n    - TV Shows\n    - TV Seasons\n    - Artists\n    - Movies\n    - Episodes\n    - Music Videos\n    - Other Videos\n    - Songs\n    - Images\n  - Playlists can be added to schedules as a schedule item\n  - Each time through the playlist, one item will be scheduled from each playlist item (if `Play All` is unchecked)\n    - NB: This does not mean every collection will always schedule one item; the normal flood playout restrictions like duration and fixed start times still apply here\n  - If `Play All` is checked, that playlist item will play all of its items each time through the playlist\n    - This can be helpful if you want to play entire collections in a specific order, e.g.\n      - Every episode from Show 1 Season 2\n      - Every episode from Show 2 Season 3\n      - Every episode from Show 1 Season 3\n  - Playlist items with fewer media items will be re-shuffled (if applicable) before those with more media items\n- Add two new environment variables to customize config and transcode folder locations\n  - `ETV_CONFIG_FOLDER`\n  - `ETV_TRANSCODE_FOLDER`\n- Add checkbox to allow use of B-frames in FFmpeg Profile (disabled by default)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix some cases of 404s from Plex when files were replaced and scanning the library from ETV didn't help\n- Fix more wildcard search phrase queries (when wildcards are used in quotes, like `title:\"law & order*\"`)\n- Fix non-wildcard simple queries when asterisks are used in quotes, like `title:\"m*a*s*h\"`\n- Fix bug where channels would unnecessarily wait on each other\n  - e.g. in-progress streams would delay responding with a playlist when new streams were starting\n- Update Plex show title in ETV when changed in Plex\n- Reindex seasons and episodes when show is updated from media server\n  - This is needed to keep `show_*` tags accurate in the search index (e.g., `show_title`, `show_studio`)\n- Fix external subtitle detection to support forced/sdh subtitles with language tag before and after forced/sdh tag:\n  - `Something.forced.en.srt`\n  - `Something.sdh.en.srt`\n  - `Something.en.forced.srt`\n  - `Something.en.sdh.srt`\n- Fix playback from Jellyfin 10.9 by allowing playlist HTTP HEAD requests\n- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` segment duration (previously 10s, now 4s)\n- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` error video generation\n- Fix MySql database migrations\n- Fix Plex library scans with MySql/MariaDB\n- Fix block playout playback when no deco is configured\n- Fix `HLS Segmenter V2` to delete old segments (use less disk space while channel is active)\n- Fix template and deco template editors to prevent items that go beyond midnight\n- Fix block playout random seeds\n  - Different blocks within a single playout will now correctly use different random seeds (shuffles)\n  - Erasing block playout history will also generate new random seeds for the playout\n- Fix building playouts that use mid-roll filler and have content without chapter markers\n  - When this happens, mid-roll will be treated as post-roll\n- Fix VAAPI decoder capability check\n  - This caused some streams to incorrectly use software decoding\n- Fix scheduling loop/failure caused by some duration schedule items\n- Fix `video_bit_depth` search field for Plex media\n- Fix template and deco template editors with MariaDB/MySql backend\n- Fix transcoding 10-bit source content using QSV acceleration on Windows\n\n### Changed\n- Show health checks at top of home page; scroll release notes if needed\n- Improve `HLS Segmenter V2` compliance by:\n  - Serving fmp4 segments when `hevc` video format is selected\n    - > 1.5. The container format for HEVC video MUST be fMP4.\n  - Using accurate BANDWIDTH value in multi-variant playlist\n  - Using proper MIME types for statically-served `.m3u8` and `.ts` files\n  - Serving playlists with gzip compression\n- Use `HLS Segmenter V2` for channel preview when channel is configured for `HLS Segmenter V2`\n- Detect and use `/dev/dri/card*` devices in addition to `/dev/dri/render*` devices\n- Change default folder locations in docker using new environment variables\n    - `ETV_CONFIG_FOLDER` - now defaults to `/config`\n    - `ETV_TRANSCODE_FOLDER` - now defaults to `/transcode`\n    - If the old locations are still present in docker, these variables will be ignored, so you can migrate at your own pace\n      - Old config location: `/root/.local/share/ersatztv`\n      - Old transcode location: `/root/.local/share/etv-transcode`\n\n## [0.8.6-beta] - 2024-04-03\n### Added\n- Add `show_studio` and `show_content_rating` to search index for seasons and episodes\n- Add two new global subtitle settings:\n  - `Use embedded subtitles`\n    - Default value: `true`\n    - When disabled, embedded subtitles will not be considered for extraction (text subtitles), or playback (all embedded subtitles)\n  - `Extract and use embedded (text) subtitles`\n    - Default value: `false`\n    - When enabled, embedded text subtitles will be periodically extracted, and considered for playback\n- Add `sub_language` and `sub_language_tag` fields to search index\n- Add `/iptv` request logging in its own log category at debug level\n- Add channel guide (XMLTV) template system\n  - Templates should be copied from `_channel.sbntxt`, `_movie.sbntxt`, `_episode.sbntxt`, `_musicVideo.sbntxt`, `_song.sbntxt`, or `_otherVideo.sbntxt` which are located in the config subfolder `templates/channel-guide`\n    - Copy the file, remove the leading underscore from the name, and only make edits to the copied file\n  - The default templates will be extracted and overwritten every time ErsatzTV is started\n  - The templates use [scribian](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/tree/master/doc) template syntax\n  - The templates contain comments describing which fields are available for use in the templates\n- Add *experimental* and *incomplete* `Images` library kind\n  - Image libraries have fallback metadata added like Other Video libraries (every folder is a tag)\n  - Image library items currently default to a duration of 15 seconds\n    - The `Media` > `Images` page can be used to configure image durations at a folder level\n    - Child folders with unset durations will inherit the closest ancestor's duration\n- Add *experimental* new streaming mode `HLS Segmenter V2`\n  - In my initial testing, this streaming mode produces significantly fewer playback warnings/errors\n  - If it tests well for others, it *may* replace the current `HLS Segmenter` in a future release\n- Add setting to change XMLTV data from `Local` time zone to `UTC`\n  - This is needed because some clients (incorrectly) ignore time zone specifier and require UTC times\n- Support `.ogv` video files in local libraries\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix antiforgery error caused by reusing existing browser tabs across docker container restarts\n  - Data protection keys will now be persisted under ErsatzTV's config folder instead of being recreated at startup\n- Fix bug updating/replacing Jellyfin movies\n  - A deep scan can be used to fix all movies, otherwise any future updates made to JF movies will correctly sync to ETV\n- Automatically generate JWT tokens to allow channel previews of protected streams\n- Fix bug applying music video fallback metadata\n- Fix playback of media items with no audio streams\n- Fix timestamp continuity in `HLS Segmenter` sessions\n  - This should make *some* clients happier\n- Fix `Other Video`, `Song` and `Image` fallback metadata tags to always include parent folder (folder added to library)\n- Allow playback of items with any positive duration, including less than one second\n- Fix VAAPI transcoding of OTA content containing A53 CC data\n- Fix AV1 software decoder priority (`libdav1d`, `libaom-av1`, `av1`)\n- Fix some stream failures caused by loudnorm filter\n- Fix multi-collection editor improperly disabling collections/smart collections that haven't already been added to the multi-collection\n- Fix path replacement logic when media server paths use inconsistent casing (e.g. `\\\\SERVERNAME` AND `\\\\ServerName`)\n- Fix *many* search queries, including actors with the name `Will`\n- Fix sqlite `database is locked` error that would crash ETV on startup after search index corruption\n- Fix bug where replacing files in Plex would be missed by subsequent ETV library scans\n  - This fix will require a one-time re-scan of each Plex library in full\n  - After the initial full scan, incremental scans will behave as normal\n- Fix edge case where some local episodes, music videos, other videos, songs, images would not automatically be restored from trash\n- Fix `MPEG-TS` playback when JWT tokens are enabled for streaming endpoints\n\n### Changed\n- Log search index updates under scanner category at debug level, to indicate a potential cause for the UI being out of date\n- Batch search index updates to keep pace with library scans\n  - Previously, search index updates would slowly process over minutes/hours after library scans completed\n  - Search index updates should now complete at the same time as library scans\n- Do not unnecessarily update the search index during media server library scans\n- Use different library for reading song metadata that supports multiple tag entries\n- Update `/iptv` routing to make UI completely inaccessible from that path prefix\n- Use CUDA 11 instead of CUDA 12 in NVIDIA docker image to significantly lower required driver version\n- Allow block durations with 5-minute increments (e.g., 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, etc.)\n\n## [0.8.5-beta] - 2024-01-30\n### Added\n- Respect browser's `Accept-Language` header for date time display\n- Add new schedule item setting `Fill With Group Mode`\n  - This setting is only available when a `Collection`, `Multi-Collection` or `Smart Collection` is scheduled with `Duration` or `Multiple` playout modes\n  - Use this setting when you want to schedule a collection containing groups (show or artists), with only videos from a single group (show or artist) being used in each rotation\n  - The options are `None`, `Ordered Groups` and `Shuffled Groups`:\n    - `None`: no change to scheduling behavior - all groups (shows and artists) will be shuffled/ordered together\n    - `Ordered Groups`: each time this item is scheduled, the entire `Duration` or `Multiple` will be filled with a single group, and the groups will rotate in a fixed order\n    - `Shuffled Groups`: each time this item is scheduled, the entire `Duration` or `Multiple` will be filled with a single group, and the groups will rotate in a shuffled order\n- Add new playout type `External Json`\n  - Use this playout type when you want to manage the channel schedule using DizqueTV\n  - You must point ErsatzTV to the channel number json file from DizqueTV, e.g. `channels/1.json`\n  - For playback, ErsatzTV will first check for the appropriate media file file locally\n    - If found, ErsatzTV will run ffprobe to get statistics immediately before streaming from disk\n  - When local files are unavailable, ErsatzTV must be logged into the same Plex server as DizqueTV\n    - ErsatzTV will ask Plex for statistics immediately before streaming from Plex\n- Add new *experimental* playout type `Block`\n  - **This playout type is under active development and updates may reset or delete related playout data**\n  - Many planned features are missing, incomplete, or result in errors. This is expected.\n  - Block playouts consist of:\n    - `Blocks` - ordered list of items to play within the specified duration\n    - `Templates` - a generic \"day\" that consists of blocks scheduled at specific times\n    - `Playout Templates` - templates to schedule using the specified criteria. Only one template will be selected each day\n  - Much more to come on this feature as development continues\n- Show chapter markers in movie and episode media info\n- Add two new API endpoints for interacting with transcoding sessions (MPEG-TS and HLS Segmenter):\n  - GET `/api/sessions`\n    - Show brief info about all active sessions\n  - DELETE `/api/session/{channel-number}`\n    - Stop the session for the given channel number\n- Add channel preview (web-based video player)\n  - Channels MUST use `H264` video format and `AAC` audio format\n  - Channels MUST use `MPEG-TS` or `HLS Segmenter` streaming modes\n    - Since `MPEG-TS` uses `HLS Segmenter` under the hood, the preview player will use `HLS Segmenter`, so it's not 100% equivalent, but it should be representative\n- Add button to stop transcoding session for each channel that has an active session\n- Add more log levels to `Settings` page, allowing more specific debug logging as needed\n    - Default Minimum Log Level (applies when no other categories/level overrides match)\n    - Scanning Minimum Log Level\n    - Scheduling Minimum Log Level\n    - Streaming Minimum Log Level\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix error loading path replacements when using MySql\n- Fix tray icon shortcut to open logs folder on Windows\n- Unlock playout when playout build fails\n- Ignore errors deleting old HLS segments; this should improve stream reliability\n- Update show year when changed within Plex\n- Fix crop scale behavior with NVIDIA, QSV acceleration\n- Fix bug that corrupted uploaded images (watermarks, channel logos)\n  - Re-uploading images should fix them\n- Recreate XMLTV channel list (including logos) when channels are edited in ErsatzTV\n  - This bug caused the ErsatzTV logo to be used instead of channel logos in some cases\n- Update drop down search results in main search bar when items are created/edited/removed\n- Fix green line at bottom of video when NVIDIA accel is used with intermittent watermark\n- Fix error starting streaming session when subtitles are still being extracted for the current item\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade from .NET 7 to .NET 8\n- In schedule items, disambiguate seasons from shows with the same title by including show year\n  - Old format: `Show Title (Season Number)`\n  - New format: `Show Title (Show Year) - Season Number`\n- Remove FFmpeg Profile `Normalize Loudness` option `dynaudnorm` as it often caused streams to fail to start\n- Disable loudness normalization by default in new FFmpeg Profiles\n- Use AAC audio format by default in new FFmpeg Profiles\n\n## [0.8.4-beta] - 2023-12-02\n### Fixed\n- Fix playout builder crash with improperly configured pad filler preset\n- Properly validate filler preset mode pad to require `filler pad to nearest minute` value\n- Fix bug where previously-synchronized collection tags would disappear\n  - This bug affected Jellyfin, Emby and Plex collections\n- Fix detection of AMF hardware acceleration on Windows\n\n## [0.8.3-beta] - 2023-11-22\n### Added\n- Add `Scaling Behavior` option to FFmpeg Profile\n  - `Scale and Pad`: the default behavior and will maintain aspect ratio of all content\n  - `Stretch`: a new mode that will NOT maintain aspect ratio when normalizing source content to the desired resolution\n  - `Crop`: a new mode that will scale beyond the desired resolution (maintaining aspect ratio), and crop to desired resolution\n    - **This mode does NOT detect black and intelligently crop**\n    - The goal is to fill the canvas by over-scaling and cropping, instead of minimally scaling and padding\n- Include `inputstream.ffmpegdirect` properties in channels.m3u when requested by Kodi\n- Log playout item title and path when starting a stream\n  - This will help with media server libraries where the URL passed to ffmpeg doesn't indicate which file is streaming\n- Add QSV Capabilities to Troubleshooting page\n- Add `language_tag` and `seconds` fields to search index\n- Allow synchronizing Plex `TV Show` libraries that use `Personal Media Shows` agent\n- Include Noto CJK Fonts in docker images to support those characters in generated subtitles like songs and music video credits\n- Support show fallback metadata with folder names like `Show.Name(1992)`\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix playout bug that caused some schedule items with fixed start times to be pushed to the next day\n- Fix playout bug that prevented padded durations from fitting within a schedule item of the same duration\n  - For example, filler that padded to 30 minutes would often not fit in a 30 minute duration schedule item\n- Fix VAAPI transcoding 8-bit source content to 10-bit\n- Fix NVIDIA subtitle scaling when `scale_npp` filter is unavailable\n- Remove ffmpeg and ffprobe as required dependencies for scanning media server libraries\n  - Note that ffmpeg is still *always* required for playback to work\n- Fix PGS subtitle pixel format with Intel VAAPI\n- Fix some cases where `Copy` button would fail to copy to clipboard\n- Fix some cases where ffmpeg process would remain running after properly closing ErsatzTV\n- Fix QSV HLS segment duration\n  - This behavior caused extremely slow QSV stream starts\n- Fix displaying multiple languages in UI for movies, artists, shows\n- Fix MySQL queries that could fail during media server library scans\n- Fix scanning Jellyfin libraries when library options and/or path infos are not returned from Jellyfin API\n- Fix error indexing music videos in `File Not Found` state\n- Fix bug scheduling duration filler when filler collection contains item with zero duration\n- Fix bug displaying television seasons for shows that have no year metadata\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade ffmpeg to 6.1, which is now *required* for all installs\n- Use new ffmpeg throttling method to minimize cpu/gpu use without impacting audio normalization\n- Change FFmpeg Profile `Normalize Loudness` setting from checkbox to dropdown\n  - `Off`: do not normalize loudness\n  - `loudnorm`: use `loudnorm` filter to normalize loudness (generally higher CPU use)\n  - `dynaudnorm`: use `dynaudnorm` filter to normalize loudness (generally lower CPU use)\n- Jellyfin collection scanning will no longer happen after every (automatic or forced) library scan\n    - Automatic/periodic scans will check collections one time after all libraries have been scanned\n    - There is a new table in the `Media` > `Libraries` page with a button to manually re-scan Jellyfin collections as needed\n- In FFmpeg Profile editor, only display hardware acceleration kinds that are supported by the configured ffmpeg\n- Test QSV acceleration if configured, and fallback to software mode if test fails\n- Detect QSV capabilities on Linux (supported decoders, encoders)\n- Use hardware acceleration for error messages/offline messages\n- Try to parse season number from season folder when Jellyfin does not provide season number\n  - This *may* fix issues where Jellyfin libraries show all season numbers as 0 (specials)\n- Rework Plex collection scanning\n    - Automatic/periodic scans will check collections one time after all libraries have been scanned\n    - There is a table in the `Media` > `Libraries` page with a button to manually re-scan Plex collections as needed\n    - Plex smart collections will now be synchronized as tags, similar to other Plex collections\n\n## [0.8.2-beta] - 2023-09-14\n### Added\n- Automatically rebuild search index after improper shutdown\n- Add *experimental* support for Elasticsearch as search index backend\n  - No query changes should be needed since ES is backed by lucene and supports the same query syntax\n  - This can be configured using the following env vars (note the double underscore separator `__`)\n    - `ELASTICSEARCH__URI` (e.g. `http://localhost:9200`)\n    - `ELASTICSEARCH__INDEXNAME` (default is `ersatztv`)\n- Add *experimental* support for MySQL/MariaDB database provider\n  - ***There is no functionality to migrate data between providers***\n  - This can be configured using the following env vars (note the double underscore separator `__`)\n    - `PROVIDER` - set to `MySql`\n    - `MYSQL__CONNECTIONSTRING` - (e.g. `Server=localhost;Database=ErsatzTV;Uid=root;Pwd=ersatztv;`)\n- Add option to use shared Plex servers, not just owned servers\n  - This can be enabled by setting the env var `ETV_ALLOW_SHARED_PLEX_SERVERS` to any non-empty value\n- Show Plex server names in Libraries page\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix subtitle scaling when using QSV hardware acceleration\n- Fix log viewer crash when log file contains invalid data\n- Clean channel guide cache on startup (delete channels that no longer exist)\n- Fix Emby movie libraries so local file access is not required\n- Fix adding alternate schedule\n- Fix parsing show title from NFO file that also contains season information\n\n### Changed\n- Optimize transcoding session to only work ahead (at max speed) for 3 minutes before throttling to realtime\n  - This should *greatly* reduce cpu/gpu use when joining a channel, particularly with long content\n- Allow manually editing (typing) schedule item fixed start time\n- Use different control for editing schedule item duration, and allow 24-hour duration\n  - This is needed if you want a default/fallback alternate schedule to fill the entire day with one schedule item\n  - The schedule item should have a fixed start time of midnight (00:00) and a duration of 24 hours\n- Use Direct3D 11 for QSV acceleration on Windows\n\n## [0.8.1-beta] - 2023-08-07\n### Added\n- Add custom resolution management to `Settings` page\n\n### Fixed\n- Only allow a single instance of ErsatzTV to run\n  - This fixes some cases where the search index would become unusable\n- Fix VAAPI rate control mode capability check\n\n### Changed\n- Rework startup process to show UI as early as possible\n  - A minimal UI will indicate when the database and search index are initializing\n  - The UI will automatically refresh when the initialization processes have completed\n- Force ffmpeg to use one thread when hardware acceleration is used since hardware acceleration does not support multiple threads\n\n## [0.8.0-beta] - 2023-06-23\n### Added\n- Disable playout buttons and show spinning indicator when a playout is being modified (built/extended, or subtitles are being extracted)\n- Automatically reload playout details table when playout build is complete\n- Add `Discard To Fill Attempts` setting to duration playout mode\n  - This setting only has an effect when it's configured to be greater than zero and when using `Shuffle` or `Random` playback order\n  - When the current item is longer than the remaining duration, it will be discarded and ETV will try to fit the next item in the collection, up to the configured number of times\n  - When the remaining duration is shorter than all items in the collection, the normal filler logic will be used\n- Add `Finish` column to playout detail table\n\n### Fixed\n- Skip checking for subtitles to extract when subtitles are not enabled on a channel/schedule item\n- Properly scale subtitles when using hardware acceleration\n- Fix color normalization of content with missing color metadata when using NVIDIA acceleration\n- `VAAPI`: explicitly use `CQP` rate control mode when it's the only compatible mode\n- Fix scaling anamorphic Emby content that Emby claims is not anamorphic\n\n### Changed\n- `HLS Direct` streaming mode\n    - Use `MPEG-TS` container/output format by default to maintain v0.7.8 compatibility\n      - `MP4` and `MKV` container/output format can still be configured in `Settings`\n    - Improve `MP4` compatibility with certain content\n- For `Pad` and `Duration` filler - prioritize filling the configured pad/duration\n  - This will skip filler that is too long in an attempt to avoid unscheduled time\n  - You may see the same filler more often, which means you may want to add more filler to your library so ETV has more options\n- Update ffmpeg, libraries and drivers in all docker images\n\n## [0.7.9-beta] - 2023-06-10\n### Added\n- Synchronize actor metadata from Jellyfin and Emby television libraries\n  - New libraries and new episodes will get actor data automatically\n  - Existing libraries can deep scan (one time) to retrieve actor data for existing episodes\n- `HLS Direct` streaming mode\n    - Use `MP4` container/output format by default, with new global option to use `MKV` container/output format\n    - `MP4` output format: stream copy dvd subtitles\n    - `MKV` output format: stream copy any embedded subtitles\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix extracting embedded text subtitles that had been incompletely extracted in the past\n- Fix fallback filler looping by forcing software mode for this content\n  - Other content will still use hardware acceleration as configured\n  - Hardware-accelerated fallback filler may be re-enabled in the future\n- Fix playout building when shuffle in order is used with a single media item\n- Fix pgs subtitle burn in from media server libraries\n- Fix subtitle and watermark overlays with RadeonSI VAAPI driver\n- Fix NVIDIA pipeline to use hardware-accelerated decoder with 8-bit h264 content\n\n### Changed\n- Timeout playout builds after 2 minutes; this should prevent playout bugs from blocking other functionality\n\n## [0.7.8-beta] - 2023-04-29\n### Added\n- Add `Season, Episode` playback order\n  - This is currently *only* available when a show is added directly to a schedule\n  - This will ignore release date and sort exclusively by season number and then by episode number\n- Add `Show Media Info` button to movie and episode detail pages for troubleshooting\n\n### Fixed\n- Limit `HLS Direct` streams to realtime speed\n- Fix `Reset Playout` button to use worker thread instead of UI thread\n  - This fixes potential UI hangs and database concurrency bugs\n- Maintain watermark alpha channel (built-in transparency) using QSV acceleration\n- Properly extract and burn in embedded text subtitles using Jellyfin, Emby and Plex libraries\n- Fix bug where deleting a channel would not remove its data from XMLTV\n- Fix colorspace filter for some files with invalid color metadata\n- Fix playback of external subtitles on Windows\n- Fix vobsub subtitle burn in from media server libraries\n\n### Changed\n- Remove duplicate items from smart collections before scheduling\n  - i.e. shows no longer need to be filtered out if search results also include episodes\n  - Certain multi-collection scenarios may still include duplicates across multiple collections\n- Use autocomplete fields for collection searching in schedule items editor\n  - This greatly improves the editor performance\n- Ignore dot underscore files\n\n## [0.7.7-beta] - 2023-04-07\n### Added\n- Use `plot` field from Other Video NFO metadata as XMLTV description\n- Add detailed warning log when a file is added to ErsatzTV more than once\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix updating (re-adding) Trakt lists to properly use new metadata ids that were not present when originally added\n- Fix local show library scanning with non-english season folder names, e.g. `Staffel 02`\n- Fix bug where local libraries would merge with media server libraries when the same file was added to both libraries\n- Fix transcoding some 10-bit content from media servers using VAAPI acceleration\n- Fix decoding of MPEG-4 Part 2 (e.g. DivX) content using NVIDIA acceleration\n- Fix color normalization from `bt470bg` to `bt709` using QSV acceleration\n- Fix adding files to search index with unknown video codec\n- Fix subtitle burn-in (embedded or external) using Jellyfin, Emby and Plex libraries\n    - **This requires a one-time full library scan, which may take a long time with large libraries.**\n\n### Changed\n- Use Poster artwork for XMLTV if available\n  - If Poster artwork is unavailable, use Thumbnail\n- Improve XMLTV response time by caching data as playouts are updated\n\n## [0.7.6-beta] - 2023-03-24\n### Added\n- Add `Troubleshooting` page with aggregated settings/hardware accel info for easy reference\n- Read `director` fields from music video NFO metadata\n- Pass `directors` and `studios` to music video credit templates\n- Add optional JSON Web Token (JWT) query string auth for streaming endpoints (everything under `/iptv`)\n  - This can be configured using the following env var (note the double underscore separator `__`)\n    - `JWT__ISSUERSIGNINGKEY`\n  - When configured, a JWT signed with the configured signing key is required to be passed in the query string as `access_token`, for example:\n    - `http://localhost:8409/iptv/channels.m3u?access_token=ABCDEF`\n    - `http://localhost:8409/iptv/xmltv.xml?access_token=ABCDEF`\n  - When channels are retrieved this way, the access token will automatically be passed through to all necessary urls\n  - Note that ONLY the `/iptv` endpoints will require auth when JWT is configured\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix scaling anamorphic content from non-local libraries\n- Fix direct streaming content from Jellyfin that has external subtitles\n  - Note that these subtitles are not currently supported in ETV, but they did cause a playback issue\n- Fix Jellyfin, Emby and Plex library scans that wouldn't work in certain timezones\n- Fix song normalization to match FFmpeg Profile bit depth\n- Fix bug playing some external subtitle files (e.g. with an apostrophe in the file name)\n- Fix bug detecting VAAPI capabilities when no device is selected in active FFmpeg Profile\n- Fix playout mode duration bugs in XMLTV\n  - Tail mode filler will properly include filler duration in XMLTV\n  - Duration that wraps across midnight will no longer have overlapping items in XMLTV\n- Maintain collection progress across all alternate schedules on a playout\n- Fix color normalization from `bt470bg` to `bt709`\n\n### Changed\n- Ignore case of video and audio file extensions in local folder scanner\n  - For example, the scanner will now find `movie.MKV` as well as `movie.mkv` on case-sensitive filesystems\n- Include multiple `display-name` entries in generated XMLTV\n  - Plex should now display the channel number instead of the channel id (e.g. `1.2` instead of `1.2.etv`)\n- Rework concurrency a bit\n  - Playout builds are no longer blocked by library scans\n  - Adding Trakt lists is no longer blocked by library scans\n  - All library scans (local and media servers) run sequentially\n- Emby collection scanning will no longer happen after every (automatic or forced) library scan\n  - Automatic/periodic scans will check collections one time after all libraries have been scanned\n  - There is a new table in the `Media` > `Libraries` page with a button to manually re-scan Emby collections as needed\n- For performance reasons, limit console log output to errors on Windows\n  - Other platforms are unchanged\n  - Log file behavior is unchanged\n\n## [0.7.5-beta] - 2023-03-05\n### Added\n- Use AV1 hardware-accelerated decoder with VAAPI, QSV, NVIDIA when available\n- Use VP9 hardware-accelerated decoder with VAAPI when available\n\n### Fixed\n- Align default docker image (no acceleration) with new images from [ErsatzTV-ffmpeg](https://github.com/ErsatzTV/ErsatzTV-ffmpeg)\n- Fix some transcoding pipelines that use software decoders\n- Improve VAAPI encoder capability detection on newer hardware\n- Fix trash page to properly display episodes with missing metadata or titles\n- Fix playback of content with yuv444p10le pixel format\n- Fix case where some multi-episode files from Plex would crash the scanner\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade all docker images and windows builds to ffmpeg 6.0\n- Plex, Jellyfin and Emby libraries now retrieve all metadata and statistics from the media server\n  - File systems will no longer be periodically scanned for libraries using these media sources\n- Plex, Jellyfin and Emby libraries now direct stream content when files are not found on ErsatzTV's file system\n  - Content will still be normalized according to the Channel and FFmpeg Profile settings\n  - Streaming from disk is preferred, so every playback attempt will first check the local file system\n- Use libvpl instead of libmfx to provide intel acceleration in vaapi docker images\n- Search queries no longer remove duplicate results as this was causing incorrect behavior\n- Prioritize audio streams that are flagged as \"default\" over number of audio channels\n    - For example, a video with a stereo commentary track and a mono \"default\" track will now prefer the \"default\" track\n- Support many more season folder names with local television libraries\n\n## [0.7.4-beta] - 2023-02-12\n### Added\n- Add button to copy/clone schedule from schedules table\n- Synchronize episode tags and genres from Jellyfin, Emby and Local show libraries\n- Add `Deep Scan` button to Jellyfin and Emby libraries\n  - This is now required to update some metadata for existing libraries, when targeted updates are not possible\n  - For example, if you already have tags and genres on your episodes in Jellyfin or Emby, you will need to deep scan each library to update that metadata on existing items in ErsatzTV\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix many QSV pipeline bugs\n- Fix MPEG2 video format with QSV and VAAPI acceleration\n- Fix playback of content with undefined colorspace\n- Fix NVIDIA color normalization with VP9 sources\n- Fix fallback filler looping\n- Fix bug where some libraries would never scan\n- Fix filler ordering so post-roll is properly scheduled after padded mid-roll\n- Fix pre/post-roll filler padding when used with mid-roll\n  - This caused overlapping schedule items, fallback filler that was too long, etc.\n\n### Changed\n- Merge generated `Other Video` folder tags with tags from sidecar NFO\n- Prioritize audio streams that are flagged as \"default\" when multiple candidate streams are available\n  - For example, a video with a stereo commentary track and a stereo \"default\" track will now prefer the \"default\" track\n\n## [0.7.3-beta] - 2023-01-25\n### Added\n- Attempt to release memory periodically\n- Add OpenID Connect (OIDC) support (e.g. Keycloak, Authelia, Auth0)\n  - This only protects the management UI; all streaming endpoints will continue to allow anonymous access\n  - This can be configured with the following env vars (note the double underscore separator `__`)\n    - `OIDC__AUTHORITY`\n    - `OIDC__CLIENTID`\n    - `OIDC__CLIENTSECRET`\n    - `OIDC__LOGOUTURI` (optional, needed for Auth0, use `https://{auth0-domain}/v2/logout?client_id={auth0-client-id}` with proper values for domain and client-id)\n- Add *experimental* alternate schedule system\n  - This allows a single playout to dynamically select a schedule based on date criteria, for example:\n    - Weekday vs weekend schedules\n    - Summer vs fall schedules\n    - Shark week schedules\n  - Alternate schedules can be managed by clicking the calendar icon in the playout list\n  - Playouts contain a prioritized (top to bottom) list of alternate schedules\n  - Whenever a playout is built for a given day, ErsatzTV will check for a matching schedule from top to bottom\n  - A given day must match all alternate schedule parameters; wildcards (`*any*`) will always match\n    - Day of week\n    - Day of month\n    - Month\n  - The lowest priority (bottom) item will always match all parameters, and can be considered a \"default\" or \"fallback\" schedule\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix schedule editor crashing due to bad music video artist data\n- Fix bug where playouts would not maintain smart collection progress on schedules that use multiple smart collections\n- Fix library scanning on osx-arm64\n- Fix ability to remove some media server libraries from ErsatzTV\n\n### Changed\n- Always use software pipeline for error display\n  - This ensures errors will display even when hardware acceleration is misconfigured\n- Call scanner process only when scanning is required based on library refresh interval\n- Use lower process priority for scanner process with unforced (automatic) library scans\n- Disable V2 UI and APIs by default\n  - V2 UI can be re-enabled by setting the env var `ETV_UI_V2` to any value\n\n## [0.7.2-beta] - 2023-01-05\n### Fixed\n- Fix VAAPI encoding in docker by switching to non-free driver\n\n### Changed\n- Rewrite log page to read directly from log files instead of sqlite\n\n## [0.7.1-beta] - 2023-01-03\n### Added\n- Add new music video credit templates\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix many transcoding failures caused by the colorspace filter\n- Fix song playback with VAAPI and NVENC\n- Fix edge case where some local movies would not automatically be restored from trash\n- Fix synchronizing Jellyfin and Emby collection items\n- Fix saving some external subtitle records to database\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade to dotnet 7\n- Upgrade all docker images to ubuntu jammy and ffmpeg 5.1.2\n- Limit library scan interval between 0 and 1,000,000\n  - 0 means do not automatically scan libraries\n  - 1 to 999,999 means scan if it has been that many hours since the last scan\n- Use new `ErsatzTV.Scanner` process for scanning all libraries\n  - This should reduce the ongoing memory footprint\n\n## [0.7.0-beta] - 2022-12-11\n### Fixed\n- Fix removing Jellyfin and Emby libraries that have been deleted from the source media server\n- Fix `Work-Ahead HLS Segmenter Limit` setting to properly limit number of channels that can work-ahead at once\n- Include base path value in generated channel playlist (M3U) and channel guide (XMLTV) links\n- Fix parsing song metadata from OGG audio files\n- Properly unlock/re-enable trakt list operations after an operation is canceled\n\n### Added\n- Add (required) bit depth normalization option to ffmpeg profile\n  - This can help if your card only supports e.g. h264 encoding, normalizing to 8 bits will allow the hardware encoder to be used\n- Extract font attachments after extracting text subtitles\n  - This should improve SubStation Alpha subtitle rendering\n- Detect VAAPI capabilities and fallback to software decoding/encoding as needed\n- Add audio stream selector scripts for episodes and movies\n  - This will let you customize which audio stream is selected for playback\n  - Episodes are passed the following data:\n    - `channelNumber`\n    - `channelName`\n    - `showTitle`\n    - `showGuids`: array of string ids like `imdb_1234` or `tvdb_1234`\n    - `seasonNumber`\n    - `episodeNumber`\n    - `episodeGuids`: array of string ids like `imdb_1234` or `tvdb_1234`\n    - `preferredLanguageCodes`: array of string preferred language codes configured for the channel\n    - `audioStreams`: array of audio stream data, each containing\n      - `index`: the stream's index number, this is what the function needs to return\n      - `channels`: the number of audio channels\n      - `codec`: the audio codec\n      - `isDefault`: bool indicating whether the stream is flagged as default\n      - `isForced`: bool indicating whether the stream is flagged as forced\n      - `language`: the stream's language\n      - `title`: the stream's title\n  - Movies are passed the following data:\n      - `channelNumber`\n      - `channelName`\n      - `title`\n      - `guids`: array of string ids like `imdb_1234` or `tvdb_1234`\n    - `preferredLanguageCodes`: array of string preferred language codes configured for the channel\n    - `audioStreams`: array of audio stream data, each containing\n        - `index`: the stream's index number, this is what the function needs to return\n        - `channels`: the number of audio channels\n        - `codec`: the audio codec\n        - `isDefault`: bool indicating whether the stream is flagged as default\n        - `isForced`: bool indicating whether the stream is flagged as forced\n        - `language`: the stream's language\n        - `title`: the stream's title\n- Add new fields to search index\n  - `video_codec`: the video codec\n  - `video_bit_depth`: the number of bits in the video stream's pixel format, e.g. 8 or 10\n  - `video_dynamic_range`: the video's dynamic range, either `sdr` or `hdr`\n\n### Changed\n- Change `Multi-Episode Shuffle` scripting system to use Javascript instead of Lua\n\n## [0.6.9-beta] - 2022-10-21\n### Fixed\n- Fix bug where tail or fallback filler would sometimes schedule much longer than expected\n  - This only happened with fixed start schedule items following a schedule item with tail or fallback filler\n- Fix NFO reader bug that caused inaccurate warning messages about invalid XML and incomplete metadata\n- Fix reverse proxy SSL termination support by supporting `X-Forwarded-Proto` header\n- Fix automatic playout reset scheduling\n  - Playouts would reset every 30 minutes between midnight and the configured time, instead of only at the configured time\n- XMLTV: properly group schedule items with `Custom Title` followed by item(s) with `Guide Mode` set to `Filler`\n\n### Added\n- Add music video credits template system\n  - Templates are selected in each channel's settings\n  - Templates should be copied from `_default.ass.sbntxt` which is located in the config subfolder `templates/music-video-credits`\n    - Copy the file, give it any name ending with `.ass.sbntext`, and only make edits to the copied file\n  - The default template will be extracted and overwritten every time ErsatzTV is started\n  - The template is an [Advanced SubStation Alpha](http://www.tcax.org/docs/ass-specs.htm) file using [scribian](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/tree/master/doc) template syntax\n  - The following fields are available for use in the template:\n    - `resolution`: the ffmpeg profile's resolution, which is used for margin calculations\n    - `title`: the title of the music video\n    - `track`: the music video's track number\n    - `album`: the music video's album\n    - `plot`: the music video's plot\n    - `release_date`: the music video's release date\n    - `artist`: the music videos artist (the parent folder)\n    - `all_artists`: a list of additional artists from the music video's sidecar NFO metadata file\n    - `duration`: the timespan duration of the music video, which can be used to calculate timing of additional subtitles\n    - `stream_seek`: the timespan that ffmpeg will seek into the media item before beginning playback\n- Add `Multi-Episode Shuffle` playout order for `Television Show` schedule items\n  - The purpose of this playout order is to improve randomization for shows that normally have intro, multiple episodes, and outro\n  - This playout order requires splitting the parts into individual files (e.g. splitting `s01e01-03.mkv` into `s01e01.mkv`, `s01e02.mkv` and `s01e03.mkv`)\n  - This playout order requires a lua script in the config subfolder `scripts/multi-episode-shuffle`\n  - The lua script should be named for the television show's guid, e.g. `tvdb_12345.lua` or `imdb_tt123456789.lua`\n  - The script defines the number of parts that each un-split file typically contains\n  - The script also defines a function to map each episode to a part number (or no part number i.e. `nil` if an episode has not been split)\n  - All groups of part numbers (i.e. all part 1s, all part 2s) will be shuffled\n  - The playout order will then schedule a random part 1 followed by a random part 2, etc\n    - Un-split (`nil`) episodes will be randomly placed between re-combined parts (e.g. part1, part2, part3, un-split, part1, part2, part3)\n- Add `ETV_BASE_URL` environment variable to support reverse proxies that use paths (e.g. `/ersatztv`)\n\n### Changed\n- No longer place watermarks within content by default (e.g. within 4:3 content padded to a 16:9 resolution)\n  - This can be re-enabled if desired using the `Place Within Source Content` checkbox in watermark settings\n\n## [0.6.8-beta] - 2022-10-05\n### Fixed\n- Fix typo introduced in `0.6.7-beta` that stopped QSV HEVC encoder from working\n- Fix scaling logic for `Nvidia` acceleration and software mode\n- Attempt to position watermarks within content (not over added black padding)\n- Fix search results for `Other Videos` when NFO metadata is used\n- Properly synchronize tags from Emby movies and shows\n- Properly sync updated file paths from Plex\n- Fix numeric range search queries (e.g. `minutes:[5 TO 10]`, `minutes:[* TO 3]`)\n\n### Added\n- Add `QSV Device` option to ffmpeg profile on linux\n- Add guids to search index (e.g. `imdb:tt000000`, `tvdb:12345`)\n\n## [0.6.7-beta] - 2022-09-05\n### Fixed\n- When all audio streams are selected with `HLS Direct`, explicitly copy them without transcoding\n  - This only happens when the channel does not have a `Preferred Audio Language`\n- Fix scanner crash caused by invalid mtime\n- `VAAPI`: Downgrade libva from 2.15 to 2.14\n- Fix bug with XMLTV that caused some filler to display with primary content details\n- Multiple fixes for content scaling with `Nvidia`, `Qsv` and `Vaapi` accelerations\n- Properly scale image-based subtitles\n- Fix bug where a schedule containing a single item (fixed start and flood) would never finish building a playout\n  - Logic was also added to detect infinite playout build loops in the future and stop them\n- Fix bug where `Other Videos` wouldn't be included in scheduling mode `Shuffle In Order`\n\n### Added\n- Add `Preferred Audio Title` feature\n    - Preference can be configured in channel settings and overridden on schedule items\n    - When a title is specified, audio streams that contain that title (case-insensitive search) will be prioritized\n    - This can be helpful for creating channels that use commentary tracks\n    - External tooling exists to easily update title/name metadata if your audio streams don't already have this metadata\n- Add `Amf` hardware acceleration option for AMD GPUs on Windows\n- Add `QSV Extra Hardware Frames` parameter for tuning QSV acceleration\n  - Performance may improve on some systems after doubling or halving the default value of `64`\n\n## [0.6.6-beta] - 2022-08-17\n### Fixed\n- Use MIME Type `application/x-mpegurl` for all playlists instead of `application/vnd.apple.mpegurl`\n- Replace `setsar` filter with `setdar` filter\n  - `setsar` caused issues scaling between two different aspect ratios\n    - For example, some 4:3 content would appear stretched when scaled to a 16:9 resolution\n  - `setdar` is now only used when aspect ratios match\n- Prioritize aspect ratio from container when video stream contains conflicting aspect ratio\n  - This is usually caused by bad authoring, but the change should improve scaling behavior for edge cases\n\n### Added\n- Support DSD audio file formats (DFF and DSF) in local song libraries\n- Support OGG audio file formats (OGG, OPUS, OGA, OGX, SPX) in local song libraries\n\n### Changed\n- Always return playlist after a maximum of 8 seconds while starting up an HLS Segmenter session\n- Use multi-variant playlists instead of redirects for HLS Segmenter sessions\n- Upgrade ffmpeg from 5.0 to 5.1 in most docker images (not ARM variants)\n    - Upgrading from 5.0 to 5.1 is also recommended for other installations (Windows, Linux)\n\n## [0.6.5-beta] - 2022-08-02\n### Fixed\n- Fix database initializer; fresh installs with v0.6.4-beta are missing some config data and should upgrade\n\n## [0.6.4-beta] - 2022-07-28\n### Fixed\n- Fix subtitle stream selection when subtitle language is different than audio language\n- Fix bug with unsupported AAC channel layouts\n- Fix NVIDIA second-gen maxwell capabilities detection\n- Return distinct search results for episodes and other videos that have the same title\n  - For example, two other videos both named `Trailer` would previously have displayed as one item in search results\n- Fix schedules that would begin to repeat the same content in the same order after a couple of days\n\n### Added\n- Add `640x480` resolution\n\n## [0.6.3-beta] - 2022-07-04\n### Fixed\n- Maintain stream continuity when playout is rebuilt for a channel that is actively being streamed\n- Properly apply changes to episode title, sort title, outline and plot from Plex\n- Fix search index for other videos and songs\n  - In previous versions, some libraries would incorrectly display only one item\n- Properly display old versions of renamed items in trash\n\n### Added\n- Add `Minimum Log Level` option to `Settings` page\n  - Other methods of configuring the log level will no longer work\n\n## [0.6.2-beta] - 2022-06-18\n### Fixed\n- Fix content repeating for up to a minute near the top of every hour\n- Check whether hardware-accelerated hevc codecs are supported by the NVIDIA card\n  - Software codecs will be used if they are unsupported by the NVIDIA card\n- Fix sorting of channel contents in EPG\n- Fix Jellyfin admin user id sync\n  - Ignore disabled admins and admins who do not have access to all libraries\n\n### Added\n- Add 32-bit `arm` docker tags (`develop-arm` and `latest-arm`)\n\n### Changed\n- Regularly delete old segments from transcode folder while content is actively transcoding\n  - This should help reduce required disk space\n  - To further minimize required disk space, set `Work-Ahead HLS Segmenter Limit` to `0` in `Settings`\n\n## [0.6.1-beta] - 2022-06-03\n### Fixed\n- Fix Jellyfin show library paging\n- Properly locate and identify multiple Plex servers\n- Properly restore `Unavailable`/`File Not Found` items when they are located on disk\n\n### Added\n- Add basic music video credits subtitle generation\n  - This can be enabled in channel settings\n\n## [0.6.0-beta] - 2022-06-01\n### Fixed\n- Additional fix for duplicate `Other Videos` entries; trash may need to be emptied one last time after upgrading\n- Fix watermark opacity in cultures where `,` is a decimal separator\n- Rework playlist filtering to avoid empty playlist responses\n- Fix some QSV/VAAPI memory errors by always requesting 64 extra hardware frames\n\n### Added\n- Enable QSV hardware acceleration for vaapi docker images\n\n### Changed\n- Use paging to synchronize all media from Plex, Jellyfin and Emby\n  - This will reduce memory use and improve reliability of synchronizing large libraries\n- Disable low power mode for `h264_qsv` and `hevc_qsv` encoders\n\n## [0.5.8-beta] - 2022-05-20\n### Fixed\n- Fix error display with `HLS Segmenter` and `MPEG-TS` streaming modes\n- Remove erroneous log messages about normalizing framerate on channels where framerate normalization is disabled\n- Fix unscheduled filler gaps that sometimes happen as playouts are automatically extended each hour\n\n### Added\n- Clean transcode cache folder on startup and after `HLS Segmenter` session terminates for any reason\n\n### Changed\n- Remove thread limitation for scenarios where it is not required\n  - This should give a performance boost to installations that don't use hardware acceleration\n- Use hardware acceleration to display error messages where configured\n\n## [0.5.7-beta] - 2022-05-14\n### Fixed\n- Reduce memory use due to library scan operations\n- Fix some instances of filler getting \"stuck\" when a filler item is encountered that's too long for the gap\n- Properly ignore Plex `Other Videos` libraries (`movie` libraries where agent is `com.plexapp.agents.none`)\n- Fix `Custom Title` for schedule items with `One`, `Multiple` and `Flood` playout modes\n- Fix scheduling bug where flood items would sometimes fail to continue after midnight\n\n### Added\n- Add `metadata_kind` field to search index to allow searching for items with a particular metdata source\n  - Valid metadata kinds are `fallback`, `sidecar` (NFO), `external` (from a media server) and `embedded` (songs)\n- Add autocomplete functionality to search bar to quickly navigate to channels, ffmpeg profiles, collections and schedules by name\n- Add global setting to skip missing (file-not-found or unavailable) items when building playouts\n- Add filler preset option to allow watermarks to overlay on top of filler (disabled by default)\n  - This option is applied when new items are added to a playout; rebuilding is needed if you want the change to take effect immediately\n- Read `track` field from music video NFO metadata and use it for chronological sorting (after release date)\n- Add `Random Start Point` option to schedules\n  - When this option is enabled, all `Chronological` or `Shuffle In Order` content groups will have their start points randomized\n  - When this option is disabled, all `Chronological` or `Shuffle In Order` content groups will start with the chronologically earliest item\n\n### Changed\n- Replace invalid (control) characters in NFO metadata with replacement character `ï¿½` before parsing\n- Store partial (incomplete) NFO metadata results when invalid XML is encountered\n  - Previously, no metadata would be stored if the XML within the NFO failed to validate\n\n## [0.5.6-beta] - 2022-05-06\n### Fixed\n- Fix processing local movie NFO metadata without a `year` value\n- Fix processing local movie fallback metadata\n- Fix search edge case where very recently added items (hours) would not be returned by relative date queries\n- Fix search index validation on startup; improper validation was causing a rebuild with every startup\n- Block library scanning until search index has been recreated/upgraded\n- Fix occasional erroneous log messages when HLS channel playback times out because all clients have left\n- Fix fallback filler playback\n- Fix stream continuity when error messages are displayed\n- Fix duplicate scanning within `Other Video` libraries (i.e. folders would be scanned multiple times)\n\n### Added\n- Add `show_genre` and `show_tag` to search index for seasons and episodes\n- Use `aired` value to source release date from music video nfo metadata\n- Add NFO metadata support to `Other Video` libraries\n  - `Other Video` NFO metadata must be in the movie NFO metadata format\n\n## [0.5.5-beta] - 2022-05-03\n### Fixed\n- Fix adding episodes with no title to the search index\n  - This behavior was preventing some items from being removed from the trash\n- Support combination NFO metadata for movies, shows, artists and music videos\n  - Note that ErsatzTV does not scrape any metadata; any URLs after the XML will be ignored\n- Fix bug causing some Jellyfin and Emby content to incorrectly show as unavailable\n- Fix extracting embedded `mov_text` subtitles\n- Properly extract embedded subtitles on playouts where subtitles are only enabled on schedule items (and not on the channel itself)\n\n### Added\n- Add experimental `arm64` docker tags (`develop-arm64` and `latest-arm64`)\n- Use `Sort Title` from Movie NFO metadata if available\n- Support multiple `Artist` entries in music video NFO metadata\n\n## [0.5.4-beta] - 2022-04-29\n### Fixed\n- Cleanly stop all library scans when service termination is requested\n- Fix health check crash when trash contains a show or a season\n- Fix ability of health check crash to crash home page\n- Remove and ignore Season 0/Specials from Plex shows that have no specials\n- Automatically delete and rebuild the search index on startup if it has become corrupt\n- Automatically scan Jellyfin and Emby libraries on startup and periodically\n- Properly remove un-synchronized Plex, Jellyfin and Emby items from the database and search index\n- Fix synchronizing movies within a collection from Jellyfin\n\n### Changed\n- Update Plex, Jellyfin and Emby movie and show library scanners to share a significant amount of code\n  - This should help maintain feature parity going forward\n- Optimize search-index rebuilding to complete 100x faster\n- **No longer use network paths to source content from Jellyfin and Emby**\n  - **If you previously used path replacements to convert network paths to local paths, you should remove them**\n\n### Added\n- Add `unavailable` state for Jellyfin and Emby movie and show libraries\n- Add `height` and `width` to search index for all videos\n- Add `season_number` and `episode_number` to search index for all episodes\n- Add `season_number` to search index for seasons\n- Add `show_title` to search index for seasons and episodes\n\n## [0.5.3-beta] - 2022-04-24\n### Fixed\n- Cleanly stop Plex library scan when service termination is requested\n- Fix bug introduced with 0.5.2-beta that prevented some Plex content from being played\n- Fix spammy subtitle error message\n- Fix generating blur hashes for song backgrounds in Docker\n\n### Changed\n- No longer remove Plex movies and episodes from ErsatzTV when they do not exist on disk\n  - Instead, a new `unavailable` media state will be used to indicate this condition\n  - After updating mounts, path replacements, etc - a library scan can be used to resolve this state\n\n## [0.5.2-beta] - 2022-04-22\n### Fixed\n- Fix unlocking libraries when scanning fails for any reason\n- Fix software overlay of actual size watermark\n\n### Added\n- Add support for burning in embedded and external text subtitles\n  - **This requires a one-time full library scan, which may take a long time with large libraries.**\n- Sync Plex, Jellyfin and Emby collections as tags on movies, shows, seasons and episodes\n  - This allows smart collections that use queries like `tag:\"Collection Name\"`\n  - Note that Emby has an outstanding collections bug that prevents updates when removing items from a collection\n- Sync Plex labels as tags on movies and shows\n  - This allows smart collections that use queries like `tag:\"Plex Label Name\"`\n- Add `Deep Scan` button for Plex libraries\n  - This scanning mode is *slow* but is required to detect some changes like labels\n\n### Changed\n- Improve the speed and change detection of the Plex library scanners\n\n## [0.5.1-beta] - 2022-04-17\n### Fixed\n- Fix subtitles edge case with NVENC\n- Only select picture subtitles (text subtitles are not yet supported)\n  - Supported picture subtitles are `hdmv_pgs_subtitle` and `dvd_subtitle`\n- Fix subtitles using software encoders, videotoolbox, VAAPI\n- Fix setting VAAPI driver name\n- Fix ffmpeg troubleshooting reports\n- Fix bug where filler would behave as if it were configured to pad even though a different mode was selected\n- Fix bug where mid-roll count filler would skip scheduling the final chapter in an episode\n\n### Added\n- Add `Empty Trash` button to `Trash` page\n\n## [0.5.0-beta] - 2022-04-13\n### Fixed\n- Fix `HLS Segmenter` bug where it would drift off of the schedule if a playout was changed while the segmenter was running\n- Ensure clients that use HDHomeRun emulation (like Plex) always get an `MPEG-TS` stream, regardless of the configured streaming mode\n- Fix scheduling bug that caused some days to be skipped when fixed start times were used with fallback filler\n\n### Added\n- Add `Preferred Subtitle Language` and `Subtitle Mode` to channel settings\n  - `Preferred Subtitle Language` will filter all subtitle streams based on language\n  - `Subtitle Mode` will further filter subtitle streams based on attributes (forced, default)\n  - If picture-based subtitles are found after filtering, they will be burned into the video stream\n- Detect non-zero ffmpeg exit code from `HLS Segmenter` and `MPEG-TS`, log error output and display error output on stream\n- Add `Watermark` setting to schedule items; this allows override the channel watermark. Watermark priority is:\n  - Schedule Item\n  - Channel\n  - Global\n\n### Changed\n- Remove legacy transcoder logic option; all channels will use the new transcoder logic\n- Renamed channel setting `Preferred Language` to `Preferred Audio Language`\n- Reworked playout build logic to maintain collection progress in some scenarios. There are now three build modes:\n  - `Continue` - add new items to the end of an existing playout\n    - This mode is used when playouts are automatically extended in the background\n  - `Refresh` - this mode will try to maintain collection progress while rebuilding the entire playout\n    - This mode is used when a schedule is updated, or when collection modifications trigger a playout rebuild\n  - `Reset` - this mode will rebuild the entire playout and will NOT maintain progress\n    - This mode is only used when the `Reset Playout` button is clicked on the Playouts page\n  - **This requires rebuilding all playouts, which will happen on startup after upgrading**\n- Use ffmpeg to resize images; this should help reduce ErsatzTV's memory use\n- Use ffprobe to check for animated logos and watermarks; this should help reduce ErsatzTV's memory use\n- Allow two decimals in channel numbers (e.g. `5.73`)\n\n## [0.4.5-alpha] - 2022-03-29\n### Fixed\n- Fix streaming mode inconsistencies when `mode` parameter is unspecified\n- Fix startup on Windows 7\n\n### Added\n- Add option to automatically deinterlace video when transcoding\n  - Previously, this was always enabled; the purpose of the option is to allow disabling any deinterlace filters\n  - Note that there is no performance gain to disabling the option with progressive content; filters are only ever applied to interlaced content\n\n### Changed\n- Change FFmpeg Profile video codec and audio codec text fields to select fields\n  - The appropriate video encoder will be determined based on the video format and hardware acceleration selections\n- Remove FFmpeg Profile `Transcode`, `Normalize Video` and `Normalize Audio` settings\n  - All content will be transcoded and have audio and video normalized\n  - The only exception to this rule is `HLS Direct` streaming mode, which directly copies video and audio streams\n- Always try to connect to Plex at `http://localhost:32400` even if that address isn't advertised by the Plex API\n  - If Plex isn't on the localhost, all other addresses will be checked as with previous releases\n\n## [0.4.4-alpha] - 2022-03-10\n### Fixed\n- Fix `HLS Direct` streaming mode\n- Fix bug with `HLS Segmenter` (and `MPEG-TS`) on Windows that caused errors at program boundaries\n\n### Added\n- Perform additional duration analysis on files with missing duration metadata\n- Add `nouveau` VAAPI driver option\n\n## [0.4.3-alpha] - 2022-03-05\n### Fixed\n- Fix song sorting with `Chronological` and `Shuffle In Order` playback orders\n- Fix watermark on scaled and/or padded video with NVIDIA acceleration\n- Fix playback of interlaced mpeg2video content with NVIDIA acceleration\n- Fix playback of all interlaced content with QSV acceleration\n- Fix adding songs to collections from search results page\n- Fix bug scheduling mid-roll filler with content that contains one chapter\n  - No mid-roll filler will be inserted for content with zero or one chapters\n- Fix thread sync bug with `HLS Segmenter` (and `MPEG-TS`) streaming modes\n- Fix path replacement bug when media server path is left blank\n\n### Added\n- Add automated error reporting via Bugsnag\n  - This can be disabled by editing the `appsettings.json` file or by setting the `Bugsnag:Enable` environment variable to `false`\n- Add `album_artist` to song metadata and to search index\n- Display `album_artist` on some song videos when it's different than the `artist`\n\n### Changed\n- Framerate normalization will never normalize framerate below 24fps\n  - Instead, content with a lower framerate will be normalized up to 24fps\n- `Shuffle In Order` will group songs by album artist instead of by track artist\n\n## [0.4.2-alpha] - 2022-02-26\n### Fixed\n- Add improved but experimental transcoder logic, which can be toggled on and off in `Settings`\n- Fix `HLS Segmenter` bug when source video packet contains no duration (`N/A`)\n- Fix green line at the bottom of some content scaled using QSV acceleration\n\n### Added\n- Add configurable channel group (M3U) and categories (XMLTV)\n- Add `Shuffle Schedule Items` option to schedule configuration\n  - When this is enabled, schedule items will be shuffled rather than looped in order\n  - **To support this, all playouts will be rebuilt (one time) after upgrading to this version**\n\n### Changed\n- Disable framerate normalization by default and on all ffmpeg profiles\n  - If framerate normalization is desired (not typically needed), it can be re-enabled manually\n- Show watermarks over songs\n- Hide unused local libraries\n\n## [0.4.1-alpha] - 2022-02-10\n### Fixed\n- Normalize smart quotes in search queries as they are unsupported by the search library\n- Fix incorrect watermark time calculations caused by working ahead in `HLS Segmenter`\n- Fix ui crash adding empty path to local library\n- Fix ui crash loading collection editor\n- Properly flag items as `File Not Found` when local library path (folder) is missing from disk\n- Fix playback bug with unknown pixel format\n- Fix playback of interlaced mpeg2video on NVIDIA, VAAPI\n\n### Added\n- Include `Series` category tag for all episodes in XMLTV\n- Include movie, episode (show), music video (artist) genres as `category` tags in XMLTV\n- Add framerate normalization to `HLS Segmenter` and `MPEG-TS` streaming modes\n- Add `HLS Segmenter Initial Segment Count` setting to allow segmenter to work ahead before allowing client playback\n\n### Changed\n- Intermittent watermarks will now fade in and out\n- Show collection name in some playout build error messages\n- Use hardware-accelerated filter for watermarks on NVIDIA\n- Use hardware-accelerated deinterlace for some content on NVIDIA\n\n## [0.4.0-alpha] - 2022-01-29\n### Fixed\n- Fix m3u `mode` query param to properly override streaming mode for all channels\n  - `segmenter` for `HLS Segmenter`\n  - `hls-direct` for `HLS Direct`\n  - `ts` for `MPEG-TS`\n  - `ts-legacy` for `MPEG-TS (Legacy)`\n  - omitting the `mode` parameter returns each channel as configured\n- Link `File Not Found` health check to `Trash` page to allow deletion\n- Fix `HLS Segmenter` streaming mode with multiple ffmpeg-based clients\n  - Jellyfin (web) and TiviMate (Android) were specifically tested\n\n### Added\n- Hide console window on macOS and Windows; tray menu can be used to access UI, logs and to stop the app\n- Also write logs to text files in the `logs` config subfolder\n- Add `added_date` to search index\n    - This requires rebuilding the search index and search results may be empty or incomplete until the rebuild is complete\n- Add `added_inthelast`, `added_notinthelast` search field for relative added date queries\n    - Syntax is a number and a unit (days, weeks, months, years) like `1 week` or `2 years`\n\n## [0.3.8-alpha] - 2022-01-23\n### Fixed\n- Fix issue preventing some versions of ffmpeg (usually 4.4.x) from streaming MPEG-TS (Legacy) channels at all\n  - The issue appears to be caused by using a thread count other than `1`\n  - Thread count is now forced to `1` for all streaming modes other than HLS Segmenter\n- Fix bug with HLS Segmenter in cultures where `.` is a group/thousands separator\n- Fix search results page crashing with some media kinds\n- Always use MPEG-TS or MPEG-TS (Legacy) streaming mode with HDHR (Plex)\n  - Other configured modes will fall back to MPEG-TS when accessed by Plex\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade ffmpeg from 4.4 to 5.0 in all docker images\n    - Upgrading from 4.4 to 5.0 is recommended for all installations\n\n## [0.3.7-alpha] - 2022-01-17\n### Fixed\n- Fix local folder scanners to properly detect removed/re-added folders with unchanged contents\n- Fix double-click startup on mac\n- Fix trakt list sync when show does not contain a year\n- Properly unlock libraries when a scan is unable to be performed because ffmpeg or ffprobe have not been found\n\n### Added\n- Add trash system for local libraries to maintain collection and schedule integrity through media share outages\n  - When items are missing from disk, they will be flagged and present in the `Media` > `Trash` page\n  - The trash page can be used to permanently remove missing items from the database\n  - When items reappear at the expected location on disk, they will be unflagged and removed from the trash\n- Add basic Mac hardware acceleration using VideoToolbox\n\n### Changed\n- Local libraries only: when items are missing from disk, they will be added to the trash and no longer removed from collections, etc.\n- Show song thumbnail in song list\n\n## [0.3.6-alpha] - 2022-01-10\n### Fixed\n- Properly index `minutes` field when adding new items during scan (vs when rebuilding index)\n- Fix some nvenc edge cases where only padding is needed for normalization\n- Properly overwrite environment variables for ffmpeg processes (`LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME`, `FFREPORT`)\n\n### Added\n- Add music video `artist` to search index\n  - This requires rebuilding the search index and search results may be empty or incomplete until the rebuild is complete\n\n### Changed\n- Remove `HLS Hybrid` streaming mode; all channels have been reconfigured to use the superior `HLS Segmenter` streaming mode\n- Update `MPEG-TS` streaming mode to internally use the HLS segmenter\n  -

`Work-Ahead HLS Segmenter Limit` - the number of segmenters (channels) that will work-ahead simultaneously (if multiple channels are being watched)\n    - \"working ahead\" means transcoding at full speed, which can take a lot of resources\n    - This setting must be greater than or equal to 0\n- Add more watermark locations (\"middle\" of each side)\n- Add `VAAPI Device` setting to ffmpeg profile to support installations with multiple video cards\n- Add *experimental* `RadeonSI` option for `VAAPI Driver` and include mesa drivers in vaapi docker image\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade ffmpeg from 4.3 to 4.4 in all docker images\n  -

To re-download a Trakt list, simply add it again (no need to delete)\n  - See `Logs` for unmatched item details\n  - Trakt lists can only be scheduled by using Smart Collections\n- Add seasons to search index\n  - This is needed because Trakt lists can contain seasons\n  - This requires rebuilding the search index and search results may be empty or incomplete until the rebuild is complete\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix local television scanner to properly update episode metadata when NFO files have been added/changed\n- Properly detect ffmpeg nvenc (cuda) support in Hardware Acceleration health check\n- Fix nvenc/cuda filter for some yuv420p content\n\n## [0.0.59-alpha] -

`Hardware Acceleration` checks whether channels that transcode are using acceleration methods that ffmpeg claims to support\n  - `Movie Metadata` checks whether all movies have metadata (fallback metadata counts as metadata)\n  - `Episode Metadata` checks whether all episodes have metadata (fallback metadata counts as metadata)\n  - `Zero Duration` checks whether all movies and episodes have a valid (non-zero) duration\n  - `VAAPI Driver` checks whether a vaapi driver preference is configured when using the vaapi docker image\n- Add setting to each playout to schedule an automatic daily rebuild\n  - This is useful if the playout uses a smart collection with `released_onthisday`\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix docker vaapi support for newer Intel platforms (Gen 8+)\n  - This includes a new setting to force a particular vaapi driver (`iHD` or `i965`), as some Gen 8 or 9 hardware that is supported by both drivers will perform better with one or the other\n- Fix scanning and indexing local movies and episodes without NFO metadata\n- Fix displaying seasons for shows with no year (in metadata or in folder name)\n- Fix \"direct play\" in MPEG-TS mode (copy audio and video stream when `Transcode` is unchecked)\n\n## [0.0.58-alpha] - 2021-09-15\n### Added\n- Add `released_notinthelast` search field for relative release date queries\n  - Syntax is a number and a unit (days, weeks, months, years) like `1 week` or `2 years`\n- Add `released_onthisday` search field for historical queries\n  -

Use fake image extension (`.jpg`) for artwork in M3U and XMLTV since Kodi detects MIME type from URL\n  - Enable HEAD requests for IPTV image paths since Kodi requires those\n\n## [0.0.56-alpha] - 2021-09-10\n### Added\n- Add Smart Collections\n  - Smart Collections use search queries and can be created from the search result page\n  - Smart Collections are re-evaluated every time playouts are extended or rebuilt to automatically include newly-matching items\n  - This requires rebuilding the search index and search results may be empty or incomplete until the rebuild is complete\n- Allow `Shuffle In Order` with Collections and Smart Collections\n  - Episodes will be grouped by show, and music videos will be grouped by artist\n  - All movies will be a single group (multi-collections are probably better if `Shuffle In Order` is desired for movies)\n  - All groups will be be ordered chronologically (custom ordering is only supported in multi-collections)\n\n### Fixed\n- Generate XMLTV that validates successfully\n  - Properly order elements\n  - Omit channels with no programmes\n  - Properly identify channels using the format number.etv like `15.etv`\n- Fix building playouts when multi-part episode grouping is enabled and episodes are missing metadata\n- Fix incorrect total items count in `Multi Collections` table\n\n## [0.0.55-alpha] -

This is useful for randomizing multiple collections/shows on a single channel, while each collection maintains proper ordering (custom or chronological)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix bug parsing ffprobe output in cultures where `.` is a group/thousands separator\n  - This bug likely prevented ETV from scheduling correctly or working at all in those cultures\n  - After installing a version with this fix, affected content will need to be removed from ETV and re-added\n\n## [0.0.53-alpha] - 2021-08-01\n### Fixed\n- Fix error message displayed after building empty playout\n- Fix Emby and Jellyfin links\n\n### Changed\n- Always proxy Jellyfin and Emby artwork; this fixes artwork in some networking scenarios\n\n## [0.0.52-alpha] -
