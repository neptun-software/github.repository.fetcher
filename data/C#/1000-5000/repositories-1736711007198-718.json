          "content": "# Statiq Licensing FAQs\n\n## How is Statiq licensed?\n\nStatiq is licensed differently depending on the particular project:\n\n- [Statiq Web](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Web) and other Statiq projects\n  that build on top of [Statiq Framework](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework) are dual-licensed under\n  a [public license](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Web/blob/main/LICENSE.md)\n  for public use and a [private license](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Web/blob/main/LICENSE-PRIVATE.md)\n  for commercial use.\n  Both licenses are similar to other open licenses like MIT, with additional restrictions on use.\n    - The public license limits commercial use to fewer than 10 total individuals\n      working as employees and independent contractors and less than 100,000 USD total revenue in the prior tax year.\n      It also has exceptions for non-commercial use and trial use.\n    - The private license is per-developer and is similar to open licenses such as MIT with additional limits on assignment and sublicensing.\n- [Statiq Framework](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework) and most other peripheral Statiq projects such as the [web site](https://github.com/statiqdev/statiqdev.github.io) are provided under a permissive MIT open-source license. This scheme is commonly referred to as \"[open-core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model)\" because the core of the project is available as open-source while expanded capabilities are offered under more restrictive terms.\n\n## How do I purchase a private license for one or more developers?\n\nPlease purchase licenses from the Statiq website at [https://www.statiq.dev/support/](https://www.statiq.dev/support/).\n\nIf you require an invoice, please [contact me](mailto:dave@daveaglick.com) and I can send you one that contains payment\ninstructions and a link for direct payment. Please include your billing name (or company name), billing email address,\nbilling postal address, how many licenses should be included on the invoice, and any other details.\n\n**Note that only commercial use requires a license**. If you are only using Statiq Framework or are using Statiq Web or other Statiq projects that are licensed under the public license but aren't exceeding the small business thresholds of employees and revenue, you don't need a private license. Other than the small business employee and revenue clause, the public license is essentially the same as any other permissive open-source license. Explicit exceptions are also provided in the public license for non-commercial and trial use to make that distinction clear.\n\n## How much is the license fee for the private license?\n\nThe license fee for a private license is currently $50 per developer, per major version.\nObtaining a private license for a particular major version of Statiq gives you the right\nto use that major version and all minor and patch versions after it for commercial purposes,\nforever, across all Statiq projects that are publicly licensed under the public license.\nIn addition,\nif a new major version of Statiq is released within a one year grace period of purchasing a private license,\na new private license covering the newly released major version will be provided.\nWhen a new major version of Statiq is released outside your one year grace period,\nyou must obtain a new license to continue using it commercially.\n\n## I still have concerns about the vagueness and lack of legalese in the license.\n\nThe simplicity of the license is intentional.\nIt uses everyday English specifically to make it easier for laypeople to understand and agree to.\nAn individual developer shouldn't have\nto enlist a lawyer every time they need to decide if they can use an open source project.\nLikewise,\nopen source projects should be free to choose more sophisticated licenses\nwithout resulting in complex legal review for users.\nMaking all projects\nadhere to traditional OSI/FSF licenses that cannot apply restrictions on use greatly limits the ability of projects\nto identify and use sustainability and funding strategies that work for them.\n\nHere's the thing: I get it. The license is short and in the absence of lots of comforting legal jargon, how can it possibly be sound? If you don't agree that simple licenses provide the necessarily legal protections, how about this: **I won't sue you**. The license is primarily designed to express intent. The intent is that if you are commercially benefiting from the work that I've performed, I would like to share in that prosperity. If the language of the license combined with my assurances here does not provide you adequate legal protection, then I suggest you purchase a private license which removes uncertainty.\n\n## What if I want to use Statiq on a server?\n\nThat's fine as long as all developers that created and provisioned everything have a license.\n\n## What if I work for a non-profit?\n\nThe public license addresses that directly:\n\n> Use by any charitable organization, educational institution,\npublic research organization, public safety or health\norganization, environmental protection organization,\nor government institution is use for a permitted purpose\nregardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting\nfrom the funding.\n\n## Do content writers and other people that work on the inputs to the tool need licenses?\n\nNo.\nUnless the user is running Statiq directly, using Statiq Web in a library or application,\nor instructing a server how to run Statiq they do not need a license because they are not a \"user\" of the project.\nIt's expected that at least one person in each entity subject to the small business clause would require a license.\n\n## What software does the private license cover?\n\nThe private license\ngranted upon paying the license fee covers all software and projects under the Statiq organization.\nFor example, it grants you the right to use both Statiq Web and Statiq Docs for commercial purposes.\nStatiq Framework, official themes,\nand other extensions are often licensed under more permissive terms and don't require a private license in any case.\n\nThere are no other additional rights or privileges granted under the private license. Specifically, it does not guarantee enhanced (or even any) support or priority issue resolution.\n\n## You mean after I pay the license fee I don't get support?\n\nThat's correct. This is still a notionally open-source project and a small licensing fee does not cover an increased support burden. That said, I do my best to respond to every support request eventually (if not right away).\n\n## If I purchase a license, do other users of the application I built with Statiq also require one?\n\nNo. In general the private license includes provisions for sublicensing to your users as long as they don't then use the tools to create their own software.\n\n## But this isn't actually open-source!\n\nYou're correct, at least for the \"official\" definition of open source.\nBoth the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated) explicitly exclude software that contains limits on use from the definition of \"open source\".\nFor this reason, the public license this project uses is not, and likely never will be, an OSI-approved license.\n\nI understand that \"free software\" and \"open source\" generate a lot of feelings. If you prefer to call this project proprietary because of the way it's licensed, so be it. This is _\"a proprietary project with freely available source code that can be used without restriction for non-commercial purposes and that engages with its community of users and accepts and encourages their contributions to source code, documentation, and support when they feel it's in their best interest to do so\"_. Call that model whatever you want.\n\n## Why not use a copyleft license instead?\n\nA copyleft license places restrictions on consumers that enforce the \"openness\" of the software. This is great if your goal is to further the reach of the openness but does nothing to address the sustainability problem. It also places these restrictions indiscriminately - it doesn't matter if you're using the project for commercial or non-commercial uses. When tied to a dual-licensing model in which a less restrictive private license can be purchased, the incentive for doing so is connected to an assumption that licensees have an interest in using the software in a less open environment such as closed-source.\n\nRather than tie funding to whether or not the consumer wants to also make their code open, it makes more sense to me to tie _paying_ money _for_ use to _getting_ money _from_ use. In other words, _if you're generating revenue in part because of the work done on this project, then you should share some of that with the person who did the work you're using to generate the revenue_.\n\nThere's also a practical matter in that copyleft licenses only work well with libraries because the license deals with what happens to code that consumes or uses the copyleft-licensed software. Statiq is generally used in an application so it's not usually integrated with other code for distribution, making the provisions of a copyleft license less applicable.\n\n## I want to contribute, why do you make me sign a CLA?\n\nWhen an open source project uses a non-permissive license the question of how to deal with contributions comes up.\nA contributor license agreement (CLA)\nclarifies what will happen to the contributed code and requires the contributor to agree to it,\nwaiving some of their own copyrights in the process.\nIt's unfortunate and does add a burden to the contribution process\nbut it's necessary to ensure the entire project stays properly licensed and contributions\ncan be licensed under the terms of the public license _and_ the private license.\nStatiq's Contributor Agreement](https://gist.github.com/daveaglick/c7cccacdf7f3d57d05462a64d578d0a5) is designed\nto be as simple as possible while granting the broadest rights to the project under a non-exclusive agreement\n(it was developed using [Contributor Agreements](http://contributoragreements.org/) and then slightly modified).\n\nI hope that you understand why a CLA is needed and that it doesn't keep you from contributing. That said, you need to decide if you derive enough value from submitting a contribution (such as adding support for a feature you need) to agree to the terms of the CLA. If not then I would caution you not to undertake performing work on the project.\n\n## What about the contributions back when Statiq was Wyam?\n\nWyam was licensed under a permissive MIT license\nand so all contributions prior to the release of Statiq would have also fallen under that license.\nTo put it another way, the MIT licensing of the project meant that anyone,\nincluding the project itself, could come along,\ntake the code, and do whatever they wanted with it including re-licensing or charging for it.\nI'm more than happy\nto grant a Waiver to anyone who previously contributed to Wyam\nand would like to remove the non-commercial clause of the public license."

`ValidateAbsoluteLinks`, `ValidateRelativeLinks`, and `ValidateLinksAsError` settings in favor of the new analyzers.\n  For example, to turn on absolute link validation with an error log level, set `Analyzers: ValidateAbsoluteLinks=Error` in your configuration file (or bootstrapper, etc.)\n- Added new `ValidateAbsoluteLinks` and `ValidateRelativeLinks` analyzers (replaces the `ValidateLinks` pipeline).\n- Removed the `ValidateLinks` pipeline.\n- Added a new `AnalyzeContent` pipeline.\n- Added base `HtmlAnalyzer` and `SyncHtmlAnalyzer` classes for analyzing HTML content.\n- Added `Bootstrapper.AnalyzeHtml()` extensions for defining delegate-based HTML analyzers.\n- Made the `PreviewCommand` and `ServeCommand` in Statiq.Web.Hosting public so you can call `IBootstrapper.AddCommand<PreviewCommand>()` directly without Statiq.Web.\n\n# 1.0.0-beta.7\n\n- Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.23](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.23).\n\n# 1.0.0-beta.6\n\n- Updated Statiq Framework to version

Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.21](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.21).\n- **Breaking change:** Removed the `IBootstrapper.SetDefaultTemplate()` extension given more general use of templates. The \"default\" template should now be specified\n  by setting a templates for the HTML media type (by default it's still Razor, so this breaking change won't really affect anyone right now).\n- **Breaking Change:** Removed the `AssetFiles`, `DataFiles`, and `ContentFiles` settings and replaced with a single `InputFiles` setting for finding all input files.\n  The target pipeline and content type are now determined from the media type and metadata of the document instead of via globbing patterns for each pipeline.\n  If you previously had asset files that started with an underscore (such as a `_redirects` file), you will need to explicitly add those to the `InputFiles` patterns\n  along with the default pattern: `.AddSetting(WebKeys.InputFiles, new [] { \"**/{!_,}*\", \"_redirects\" })`.\n- Added a `ClearDataContent` document setting that clears content from data documents (for example, to support passing the data file to layouts).\n  Set this for a single data document to clear it's content or globally with `.AddSetting(WebKeys.ClearDataContent, true)` to clear the content of all data files.\n- Made the concept of \"templates\" more general. They now essentially use the media type of a document (typically inferred from file extension) to determine which pipeline to\n  process the document in and what module to use for processing. Templates can now be defined for assets, data, and content and for the `Process` and `PostProcess` phases for each.\n- Added a `ContentType` document setting to override the calculated pipeline and processing for a document (values are `Asset`, `Data`, and `Content`).\n  For example, setting the `ContentType` of a file named \"foo.json\" to `Asset` will treat the file as an asset and will not process it's content as data.\n- Added a `MediaType` document setting to override the media type calculated from the file extension.\n- Added a `RemoveScriptExtension` document setting that will convert script file names like \"foo.json.csx\" to \"foo.json\" and reset their media types so the script output can be seamlessly\n  processed by the appropriate pipeline and modules (for example, \"foo.json.csx\" will get processed by the `Data` pipeline while \"foo.md.csx\" will get processed by the `Content` pipeline).\n  The default value is `true`.\n- Removed the `Isolated` flag from the `Assets` pipeline so the set of copied assets can be retrieved from other pipelines (I.e. to generate a list of images in a directory).\n- Added support for script files (`.csx` or `.cs`) to the `Archive` pipeline (I.e. to generate JSON APIs from a collection of documents or data).\n- Added a `Script` document setting that will treat a file as a C# script, even if the extension is not `.cs` or `.csx`.\n- Added a common `Inputs` pipeline that consolidates directory metadata, sidecar, and front matter parsing and supports evaluating scripts with a `.csx` or `.cs` extension.\n  Detailed script usage will be documented on the site, but generally if the script returns null the original input document is returned, if the script returns a string the content\n  of the document will be changed to the return value, or if the script returns a document(s) those will be added to the appropriate pipeline.\n- New `Statiq.Web.Templates` project with a Statiq Web templates for the `dotnet new` CLI command (#915, thanks @devlead).\n\n# 1.0.0-beta.3\n\n- **Breaking change:** Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.20](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.20).\n  This version of Statiq Framework contains breaking changes which Statiq Web will inherit.\n- The `Content` pipeline no longer creates any metadata-based tree structure (I.e. the metadata key `Children` is no longer set). Instead, consider\n  using methods from `Outputs` such as `Outputs.GetChildren(doc)` or the new `OutputPages` property (see the Statiq Framework 1.0.0-beta.20 release notes for more details).\n- Added a new `MinimumStatiqWebVersion` key to perform a check for the minimum allowed version of Statiq Web. If this is set to something higher than the current version\n  of Statiq Web, an error will be logged and execution will stop. Any setting that starts will this key will be considered, so it's recommended the use of this key be\n  suffixed with a unique identifier to avoid conflicts between components (for example `MinimumStatiqWebVersion-MySite`). While not required or typically necessary for sites,\n  it's recommended that themes set this in their theme settings file (for example `MinimumStatiqWebVersion-CleanBlog`).\n\n# 1.0.0-beta.2\n\n- Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.19](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.19).\n  This version of Statiq Framework includes internal refactoring that provides a big performance boost.\n- Added a `AssetFiles` settings to configure the globbing patterns used for copying assets.\n\n# 1.0.0-beta.1\n\n- **Breaking change:** Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.18](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.18).\n  This version of Statiq Framework contains breaking changes which Statiq Web will inherit.\n- **Breaking change:** The `Content` pipeline no longer nests output documents and instead all documents are now output.\n  `IEnumerable<IDocument>.FilterDestinations(\"*.html\")` or `Outputs[\"*.html\"]` can be used to get \"root\" documents.\n- Added a `MakeLinksAbsolute` setting to rewrite relative links to be absolute.\n- Added a `MakeLinksRootRelative` setting to rewrite relative links to be root-relative.\n- Suppressed archive output when there's no documents to archive.\n- Added the `CacheDocuments` module to additional pipelines for faster rebuild times.\n- Added an `ArchiveKeyComparer` metadata that allows specifying a specific comparer for use with archive groups (usually with script metadata).\n- Added ability for all pipelines to ensure every document gets a `Published` value, either from an existing value or from the file name or modified date.\n- Added a `PublishedUsesLastModifiedDate` setting to control whether a file modified date should be used for getting published dates.\n- Added `settings` as a default settings file name in themes (with support for JSON, YAML, or XML formats).\n- Added support for sidecar files in other input directories at the same relative path (I.e. themes).\n- Added support for `themesettings` and `statiq` YAML (`.yml` and `.yaml`) and XML (`.xml`) configuration files in themes.\n- Fixed a bug on engine reruns (I.e. the preview command).\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha.21\n\n- Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.17](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.17).\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha.20\n\n- Added `OutputPath` setting so the output path can be set from the command-line or configuration file.\n- Added `ExcludedPaths` setting so excluded paths can be set from the command-line or configuration file.\n- Added `InputPaths` setting so input paths can be set from the command-line or configuration file.\n- Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.16](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.16).\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha.19\n\n- Added the new `Statiq.Web.props` file to a `buildTransitive` folder in the package so it flows transitively to consumers.\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha.18\n\n- Bug fix for unclosed `<ItemGroup>` in the new props file (#909, thanks @drmathias).\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha.17\n\n- Added a `IncludeInSitemap` setting to control whether a document should be included in the sitemap (#907, thanks @drmathias).\n- Fixed a bug that required feed items to have URI IDs when the specification indicates they can also be arbitrary strings (#906).\n- Added a props file to the Statiq.Web package to automatically set the default theme, extensions, and archetypes MSBuild props.\n- Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.14](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.14).\n- Added a `GatherHeadingsLevel` key that can be used to adjust the headings level when gathering headings globally or per-document (#904).\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha.16\n\n- Updated Statiq Framework to version [1.0.0-beta.13](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.13).\n- Added support for reading `themesettings.json` and `statiq.json` from the theme paths.\n- Added support for theme paths and configuring them via the bootstrapper and/or settings.\n\n#

services like Gitpod).\n- Renamed the root namespaces of the extension libraries brought over from Statiq Framework to match new project names.\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha.12\n\n- Added a new `Bootstrapper.AddWeb()` extension to add Statiq Web functionality to an existing bootstrapper.\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha.11\n\n- Changed resource mirroring to be opt-in instead of opt-out (you now need to set
