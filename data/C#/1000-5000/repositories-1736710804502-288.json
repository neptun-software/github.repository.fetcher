          "content": "# Contributing Guidelines\n\nThank you for showing interest in the development of OpenTabletDriver!\n\nOur goal with this document is to describe how contributions to OpenTabletDriver should be made,\ndepending on what kind of change is being performed.\n\nWith any contribution you make, we ask that your commits are named sensibly and similarly to the ones in our [history](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/commits/master).\nAt the very least, sentence-case your commits, and do consider prefixing the commit message with a component name in similar fashion to `Updater: Add file IncludeList`.\nIf the reasoning for a commit is potentially cryptic, consider adding a commit description to it, succinctly explaining why it was needed.\n\n# Tablet Configuration Contributions\n\nTablet configurations define tablets OpenTabletDriver can detect and operate. They provide\nspecifications, functions, and initialization data which are all used to make a drawing tablet\ndevice, also referred to as a digitizer, functional.\n\n## Adding a Configuration\n\nDocumentation for the fields within configurations can be found on the official OpenTabletDriver\nwebsite, [here](https://opentabletdriver.net/Wiki/Development/Configurations).\n\nWhen adding a new tablet configuration file to the `OpenTabletDriver.Configurations` project, these\nrules must be followed:\n\n- The `TABLETS.md` file must be updated to include the newly added configuration, including any\n  quirks or missing features. Please also place the entry near others of its manufacturer, and in\n  alphabetical order from there.\n- The tablet name should follow the format `[Manufacturer] [Model Number/Product Name]`\n- The file name must be the tablet name, *without the manufacturer\n  name,* with a `.json` extension. Spaces are acceptable, and\n  preferable to underscores.\n- The file must be located in the directory dedicated to an individual manufacturer.\n- All trailing whitespace must be trimmed before committing.\n- The current formatting of the `TABLETS.md` document must be strictly followed as below:\n\n  | Column | Contents                                                                                          |\n  | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n  | Tablet | The name of the tablet, directly from the configuration.                                          |\n  | Status | The state of the configuration (one of: Supported, Missing Features, Has Quirks, Broken, Untested) |\n  | Notes  | Any information relating to the status. This can be left empty when marked Supported or Untested. |\n\n- A description of each support status:\n\n  | Status           | Requirements                                                                                                              |\n  | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n  | Supported        | All tablet functions are fully supported without issue.                                                                   |\n  | Missing Features | Some tablet functions are unsupported (for now).                                    |\n  | Has Quirks       | Some tablet functions work, but with undesired behavior or requiring workarounds to get functioning.                      |\n  | Broken           | Tested but does not work. This is here for historical purposes, *no new configuration will be accepted with this status.* |\n  | Untested         | Entirely untested, potentially ported from other drivers or from documentation. We will potentially accept these, but strongly prefer verification being performed. |\n\n- Include sources to help with verification of the tablet's specifications. This could be the\n  manufacturer's specification sheet of the tablet, the HID report descriptor, or an educated guess\n  by taking `MaxX` and `MaxY` and converting it into millimeter units. Please note that specs\n  published by manufacturers have unfortunately been known to be wrong on occasion - avoid trusting\n  these published specs without verifying the specs are accurate to the physical product.\n- Also include a diagnostics file that shows that OTD succesfully detected the tablet.\n- If you are the owner of the tablet submitting a new config for your own tablet, you may\n  self-verify.\n\n## Updating a Configuration\n\n- If the configuration makes a change that *improves* the support status, it should be updated in\n  `TABLETS.md` according to the same rules as adding the configuration in the first place.\n- Specify the reasoning for a tablet configuration update in your pull request, otherwise we have no\n  way of knowing why the configuration change is being made.\n\n\n# Code Contributions\n\nWe strive to keep a maintainable and easily readable codebase in order to keep OpenTabletDriver\nalive and pleasant to work on.\n\nThe following rules apply to all code contributions:\n\n- The git branch should be based on and targeting the `master` branch. You should also try to create the branch\n  from the most recent commit on master possible, to keep history clean.\n- The code you commit must adhere to the rules defined in the project's `.editorconfig` file.\n  Some IDEs can recognize `.editorconfig` files and fix some of the broken rules on each file save.\n  Otherwise, you can use the `dotnet format OpenTabletDriver` command from the root of the project to sweep through all files.\n  To avoid formatting unrelated files, you may want to use the `include` option as documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-format#options).\n  Note that commits on pull requests will go through a formatting check as part of the CI workflow.\n- Follow the [C# Coding\n  Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions),\n  unless otherwise specified. We don't really do anything particularly eccentric, and most potential issues should be covered by our `.editorconfig` setup.\n- Use spaces for indentation, do not use the tab character. We use 4 space indentation. IDEs that\n  respect `.editorconfig` will do this automatically.\n- Split up individual bug fixes or feature additions into separate pull requests. If a pull request\n  depends on another, you can make the dependency be merged first by putting `- [ ] depends on\n  #<PR_ID>` in the description. This makes it easier to pinpoint why changes were made along with being\n  faster to review, and easier to revert if necessary.\n- Try to avoid opening PRs with many commits - squash commits where reasonable. If you're having\n  trouble combining commits, it may be a sign to make multiple PRs instead. However, do not\n  over-squash, preserving history and keeping commits readable is important too.\n- If the pull request closes an issue, link that issue with [closing\n  keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)\n  referring to that issue.\n\n## Setting up your environment\n\nOpenTabletDriver is a fairly simple project to set up for development. As it's a .NET project, you\nideally want an IDE capable of working with C# and .NET projects, such as:\n\n- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with C# extensions installed)\n- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)\n- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)\n\nNote that OpenTabletDriver being an open source project means a [yearly free license to use\nRider](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/#support) can be obtained.\n\nTo get started, create a fork of the repository on GitHub. Then, clone the fork you made, and ensure\nyou're capable of building OpenTabletDriver, by running either `build.ps1` (for Windows), or\n`build.sh` (for Linux and MacOS). If successful, these scripts will produce executables in a newly created\n`bin` subdirectory. You can then run OpenTabletDriver by running the executable for the Daemon and\nthe UX. For all intents and purposes, this will be a fully functional, though potentially unstable\n(as `master` is a development branch) version of OpenTabletDriver that you can use normally.\nDo note that some plugins may not have been updated to work on the latest `master` version.\n\nOnce you've confirmed you are able to build the application on your computer, you can begin making\nchanges. Before working, however, ensure you create a new branch to work in - we\nrecommend/soft-require that pull requests never be made on your fork's `master` branch - this makes\nit harder to make further PRs, as you'll have to wait for your original to be merged before you can\nmake another (as your new PR will contain commits from your previous).\n\nOnce you're done, push the created branch to your fork, and open the PR. Fill out the title and\ndescription of what the PR accomplishes, remembering to link any fixed issues. If any part of our\ncontinuous integration fails, fix it - **ideally by amending/rebasing the most recent commit and force\npushing,** rather than creating commits purely to fix CI, small spelling mistakes, etc.\n\nIf asked to make changes or fixes, please make them through GitHub's **batch commit** feature or\nlocally, and avoid making a commit per fix - making a single \"apply fixes from code review\" commit\nis preferred. If you disagree with a suggested change, provide your reasoning by replying to the\nreview comment. Resolve applied fixes, if they are not resolved by GitHub automatically.\n\n## Unit-Testing OpenTabletDriver\n\nOur CI runs unit tests on each new commit pushed on a PR, but if you'd like to test OpenTabletDriver locally, you can do so by running the command `dotnet test` from the project root, which will run all tests and report status.\nThe unit tests for the most part concern the daemon part of the driver, which performs the bulk of the \"work\" and thus is critical to test.\nOf course, we also welcome contributions adding more unit testing, our coverage is weaker outside of\ncritical areas.\n"

The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"

The goal of OpenTabletDriver is to be cross platform as possible with the highest compatibility in an easily configurable graphical user interface.\n\n<p align=\"middle\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XDYf62e.png\" width=\"410\" align=\"middle\"/>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jBW8NpU.png\" width=\"410\" align=\"middle\"/>\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZLCy6wz.png\" width=\"410\" align=\"middle\"/>\n</p>\n\n# Supported Tablets\n\nAll statuses of tablets that are supported, untested, and planned to be supported can be found here. Common issue workarounds can be found in the wiki for your platform.\n\n- [Supported Tablets](https://opentabletdriver.net/Tablets)\n\n# Installation\n\n- [Windows](https://opentabletdriver.net/Wiki/Install/Windows)\n- [Linux](https://opentabletdriver.net/Wiki/Install/Linux)\n- [MacOS](https://opentabletdriver.net/Wiki/Install/MacOS)\n\n# Running OpenTabletDriver binaries\n\nOpenTabletDriver functions as two separate processes that interact with each other seamlessly. The active program that does all of the tablet data handling is `OpenTabletDriver.Daemon`, while the GUI frontend is `OpenTabletDriver.UX.*`, where `*` depends on your platform<sup>1</sup>. The daemon must be started in order for anything to work, however the GUI is unnecessary. If you have existing settings, they should apply when the daemon starts.\n\n> <sup>1</sup>Windows uses `Wpf`, Linux uses `Gtk`, and MacOS uses `MacOS` respectively. This for the most part can be ignored if you don't build it from source as only the correct version will be provided.\n\n## Building OpenTabletDriver from source\n\nThe requirements to build OpenTabletDriver are consistent across all platforms. Running OpenTabletDriver on each platform requires different dependencies.\n\n### All platforms\n\n- .NET 8 SDK (can be obtained from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) - You want the SDK for your platform, Linux users should install via package manager where possible)\n\n#### Windows\n\nRun `build.ps1` to produce binary builds to 'bin' folder. These builds will run in portable mode by default.\n\n#### Linux\n\nRequired packages (some packages may be pre-installed for your distribution):\n\n- libx11\n- libxrandr\n- libevdev2\n- GTK+3\n\nRun `./eng/linux/package.sh`. If a \"package\" build is desired,\nthere is official support for the following packaging formats:\n\n| Package Format | Command |\n| --- | --- |\n| Generic binary tarball (`.tar.gz`) | `./eng/linux/package.sh --package BinaryTarBall` |\n| Debian package (`.deb`) | `./eng/linux/package.sh --package Debian` |\n| Red Hat package (`.rpm`) | `./eng/linux/package.sh --package RedHat` |\n\nThe generic binary tarball is designed to be extracted from the root directory.\n\n#### MacOS [Experimental]\n\nRun `./eng/macos/package.sh --package true`.\n\n# Features\n\n- Fully platform-native GUI\n  - Windows: `Windows Presentation Foundation`\n  - Linux: `GTK+3`\n  - MacOS: `MonoMac`\n- Fully fledged console tool\n  - Quickly acquire, change, load, or save settings\n  - Scripting support (json output)\n- Absolute cursor positioning\n  - Screen area and tablet area\n  - Center-anchored offsets\n  - Precise area rotation\n- Relative cursor positioning\n  - px/mm horizontal and vertical sensitivity\n- Pen bindings\n  - Tip by pressure bindings\n  - Express key bindings\n  - Pen button bindings\n  - Mouse button bindings\n  - Keyboard bindings\n  - External plugin bindings\n- Saving and loading settings\n  - Auto-loads user settings via `settings.json` in the active user `%localappdata%` or `.config` settings root directory.\n- Plugins\n  - Filters\n  - Output modes\n  - Tools\n\n# Contributing to OpenTabletDriver\n\nIf you wish to contribute to OpenTabletDriver, check out the [issue\ntracker](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/issues). When\ncreating pull requests, follow the guidelines outlined in our [contribution\nguidelines](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIf you have any issues or suggestions, [open an issue\nticket](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver/issues/new/choose)\nand fill out the template with relevant information. We welcome both bug\nreports, as well as new tablets to add support for. In many cases adding support\nfor a new tablet is quite easy.\n\nFor issues and PRs related to OpenTabletDriver's [web page](https://opentabletdriver.net), see the repository [here](https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/opentabletdriver.github.io).\n\n### Supporting a new tablet\n\nIf you'd like us to add support for a new tablet, open an issue or join our\n[discord](https://discord.gg/9bcMaPkVAR) asking for support. *We generally\nprefer that adding support for a tablet be done through discord, due to the\nback-and-forth involved*.\n\nWe'll have you do a few things like making a recording of the data sent by your\ntablet using our built-in tablet debugging tool, testing features of the tablet\n(on-tablet buttons, pen buttons, pen pressure, etc) with different configs we'll\nsend you to try.\n\nYou're also of course welcome to open a PR adding support for it yourself, if\nyou have a good grasp on what's involved.\n\nGenerally this process is relatively easy, especially if it's for a tablet\nmanufacturer we already have support for on other tablets.\n"
