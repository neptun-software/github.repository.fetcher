So I decided to make them open source so that .NET developers had a good set of free controls to use in their projects. Full source code for all the controls and components is included along with Visual Studio projects and solution files.\n\n# Getting Started #\n**Bin** directory contains already compiled copies of all the example projects and the Krypton assemblies, so I recommend you start by running the **Krypton Explorer** application in this directory. It lists all the controls along with example applications used to show them in operation.\n\n# Documentation #\n**Help** directory contains a **KryptonHelp.chm** file that can be double clicked to open the documentation. I recommend you read this before developing using the Krypton controls.\n\n# Using with Visual Studio #\n - Start **Visual Studio** and create/open your Windows Forms project\n - Open the main Form of your application and show the **Toolbox**\n - Right click the **Toolbox** and **Add Tab**, give it the name **Krypton**\n - Right click inside the new tab and select **Choose items**\n - Click **Browse** and go to the **Bin** directory, and select all the **ComponentFactory.Krypton...** assemblies\n - Select **OK** and now you have them all in the **Toolbox!**\n\n# Source #\n**Source** directory contains the full source code that you can view, modify and directly compile. The **Krypton Components** sub-directory contains all the actual controls, the other directories are for the myriad example projects.\n\n# Krypton Toolkit\n49 basic controls with full and consistent theming.\n\n![](/Images/home_toolkit1.gif?raw=true)  ![](/Images/home_toolkit2.gif?raw=true)  ![](/Images/home_toolkit3.gif?raw=true)\n![](/Images/home_toolkit4.gif?raw=true)  ![](/Images/home_toolkit5.gif?raw=true)  ![](/Images/home_toolkit6.gif?raw=true)\n\n# Krypton Ribbon\nOffice style ribbon control.\n\n![](/Images/p_ribbon1.gif?raw=true)  ![](/Images/p_ribbon2.gif?raw=true) \n![](/Images/p_ribbon3.gif?raw=true)  ![](/Images/p_ribbon4.gif?raw=true)\n\n\n# Krypton Docking\nDrag and drop just like Visual Studio.\n\n![](/Images/KDocking.gif?raw=true)\n\n# Krypton Navigator\nA TabControl but so much better.\n\n![](/Images/home_navigator1.gif?raw=true)  ![](/Images/home_navigator2.gif?raw=true)\n![](/Images/home_navigator3.gif?raw=true)  ![](/Images/home_navigator4.gif?raw=true)\n\n# Krypton Workspace\nOrganize the client area of your application.\n\n![](/Images/KWSContext2.gif?raw=true)\n\n\n\n"
