The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the\ncopyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our\ncodebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also\nneed to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you\nknow that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign\nthe CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has\napproved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.\nBefore you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with\nus first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and\npossibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid\nfrustration later on.\n\n### Code reviews\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse Github pull requests for this purpose.\n\n### The small print\nContributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than\nthe one above, the\n[Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement]\n(https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).\n"

Many of the\r\ntools take a -ProcessId flag which is used to specify the PID of a sandboxed process. The tool will impersonate\r\nthe token of that process and determine what access is allowed from that location. Also it's recommended\r\nto run these tools as an administrator or local system to ensure the system can be appropriately enumerated.\r\n\r\nEditSection: View and manipulate memory sections.\r\nTokenViewer: View and manipulate various process token values.\r\nNtCoreLib: A basic managed library to access NT system calls and objects.\r\nNtCoreLib.Forms: A few simple forms to view security descriptors and tokens.\r\nNtObjectManager: A powershell module which uses NtApiDotNet to expose the NT object manager.\r\nViewSecurityDescriptor: View the security descriptor from an SDDL string or an inherited object.\r\n\r\nYou can load the using the Import-Module Cmdlet. You'll need to disable signing requirements however.\r\n\r\nFor example copy the module to %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules then load the module with:\r\n\r\nImport-Module NtObjectManager\r\n\r\nYou can now do things like listing the NT object manager namespace using:\r\n\r\nGet-ChildItem NtObject:\\\r\n\r\nAlso see help for various commons such as Get-NtProcess, Get-NtType or New-File.\r\n\r\nThe tools can be built with Visual Studio 2022. \r\n\r\nRelease Notes:\r\n2.0.0.\r\n--------\r\n* Major refactor.\r\n"
