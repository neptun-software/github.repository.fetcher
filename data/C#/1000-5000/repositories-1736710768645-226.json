Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional\ndocumentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.\n\nPlease read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary\ninformation to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.\n\n\n## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests\n\nWe welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.\n\nWhen filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already\nreported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:\n\n* A reproducible test case or series of steps\n* The version of our code being used\n* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug\n* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment\n\n\n## Contributing via Pull Requests\nContributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:\n\n1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.\n2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.\n3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.\n\nTo send us a pull request, please:\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.\n3. Ensure local tests pass.\n4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.\n5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.\n6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.\n\nGitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and\n[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\n\n## Finding contributions to work on\nLooking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\nThis project has adopted the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct).\nFor more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq) or contact\nopensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com with any additional questions or comments.\n\n## Licensing\n\nSee the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for our project's licensing.

Programming these systems is challenging because of the need to reason about correctness in the presence of myriad possible interleaving of messages and failures. Unsurprisingly, it is common for service teams to uncover correctness bugs after deployment. Formal methods can play an important role in addressing this challenge!\n\n\n**P Overview:**\nP is a state machine based programming language for formally modeling and specifying complex\ndistributed systems. P allows programmers to model their system design as a collection of\ncommunicating state machines. P supports several backend analysis engines\n(based on automated reasoning techniques like model\nchecking and symbolic execution) to check that the distributed system modeled in P\nsatisfy the desired correctness specifications.\n\n> If you are wondering **\"why do formal methods at all?\"** or **\"how is AWS using P to gain confidence in correctness of their services?\"**, the following re:Invent 2023 talk answers this question, provides an overview of P, and its impact inside AWS:\n[(Re:Invent 2023 Talk) Gain confidence in system correctness & resilience with Formal Methods (Finding Critical Bugs Early!!)](https://youtu.be/FdXZXnkMDxs?si=iFqpl16ONKZuS4C0)\n\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdXZXnkMDxs\">\n         <img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/FdXZXnkMDxs/0.jpg\" style=\"width:40%;\">\n      </a>\n</div>\n\n**Impact**: P is currently being used extensively inside Amazon (AWS) for analysis of complex distributed systems. For example, Amazon S3 used P to formally reason about the core distributed protocols involved in its strong consistency launch. Teams across AWS are now using P for thinking and reasoning about their systems formally. P is also being used for programming safe robotics systems in Academia. P was first used to implement and validate the USB device driver stack that ships with Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Phone.\n\n**Experience and lessons learned**:\nIn our experience of using P inside AWS, Academia, and Microsoft. We have observed that P has helped developers in three critical ways: (1) **P as a thinking tool**: Writing formal specifications in P forces developers to think about their system design rigorously, and in turn helped in bridging gaps in their understanding of the system. A large fraction of the bugs can be eliminated in the process of writing specifications itself! (2) **P as a bug finder**: Model checking helped find corner case bugs in system design that were missed by stress and integration testing. (3) **P helped boost developer velocity**: After the initial overhead of creating the formal models, future updates and feature additions could be rolled out faster as these non-trivial changes are rigorously validated before implementation.\n\n> :sparkles: **_Programming concurrent, distributed systems is fun but challenging, however, a pinch of programming language design with a dash of automated reasoning can go a long way in addressing the challenge and amplify the fun!._** :sparkles:\n\n\n\n## Let the fun begin!\n\nYou can find most of the information about the P framework on: **[http://p-org.github.io/P/](http://p-org.github.io/P/)**.\n\n[What is P?](http://p-org.github.io/P/whatisP/), [Getting Started](http://p-org.github.io/P/getstarted/install/), [Tutorials](http://p-org.github.io/P/tutsoutline/), [Case Studies](http://p-org.github.io/P/casestudies/) and related [Research Publications](http://p-org.github.io/P/publications/).\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/p-org/P/issues), ask on\n[discussions](https://github.com/p-org/P/discussions), or [email us](mailto:ankushdesai@gmail.com)\n\n\n> _P has always been a collaborative project between industry and academia (since 2013) :drum:.
