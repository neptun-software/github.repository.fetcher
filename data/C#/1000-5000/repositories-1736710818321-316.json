          "content": "# How to Contribute\n\nContributions take many forms from submitting issues, writing docs, to making\ncode changes - we welcome it all!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you don't have a GitHub account, you can [sign up](https://github.com/signup/free)\nas it will help you to participate with the project.\n\nIf you are looking to contribute to the codebase, please ensure you have Visual\nStudio 2015 installed - you can download the Community edition from\n[here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx)\n\nIf you are running GitHub Desktop, you can clone this repository locally from\nGitHub using the \"Clone in Desktop\" button from the Octokit.net project page,\nor run this command in your Git-enabled shell:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/octokit/Octokit.net.git Octokit`\n\nIf you want to make contributions to the project,\n[forking the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) is the\neasiest way to do this. You can then clone down your fork instead:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/MY-USERNAME-HERE/Octokit.net.git Octokit`\n\nAfter doing that, run the `.\\build.ps1` or `./build.sh` script at the root of the repository\nto ensure everything builds and the tests pass.\n\n## How can I get involved?\n\nWe have an [`Status: Up for grabs`](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/labels/Status%3A%20Up%20for%20grabs)\ntag on our issue tracker to indicate tasks which contributors can pick up.\n\nIf you've found something you'd like to contribute to, leave a comment in the issue\nso everyone is aware.\n\nFor v1 of the Octokit.net API, we're looking to support everything that v3 of the\nGitHub API supports. As this is currently a pre-1.0 library, we're always looking\nfor ways to improve the API to make it easy to work with the GitHub API.\n\n## Making Changes\n\nWhen you're ready to make a change, create a branch off the `main` branch:\n\n```\ngit checkout main\ngit pull origin main\ngit checkout -b SOME-BRANCH-NAME\n```\n\nWe use `main` as the default branch for the repository, and it holds the most\nrecent contributions. By working in a branch away from `main` you can handle\npotential conflicts that may occur in the future.\n\nIf you make focused commits (instead of one monolithic commit) and have descriptive\ncommit messages, this will help speed up the review process.\n\nAt any time you can build the project with\n\n`.\\build.ps1 -Target Build`\nor\n`./build.sh --target=build`\n\nthis will also run code analysis rules.\n\n### Running builds cross platform\n\nOctokit.net uses a CAKE build script and can be built on multiple platforms.\n\nTo install dependencies and run the CAKE build script use the following wrapper scripts and parameter syntax:\n\n- Windows (Powershell)\n\n`.\\build.ps1 -Target <target> -Configuration Release [Additional Parameters]`\n\n- Linux/OSX (bash)\n\n`./build.sh --target=<target> --configuration==Release [Additional Parameters]`\n\n### Running Tests\n\nOctokit.net has a suite of tests which you can run to ensure existing\nbehaviour is not affected. If you're adding new features, please add some\ntests alongside so the maintainers can sleep at night, knowing their\nsafety blanket is nice and green!\n\nThe test suite is arranged into fast and slow tests.\n\n#### Fast Tests\n\n**Unit Tests:**\n\n`.\\build.ps1 -Target UnitTests` or `./build.sh --target=UnitTests`\n\nAlternatively, you can run the `Octokit.Tests` assembly in the Visual Studio test runner.\n\nThese tests verify specific behaviour while being isolated from the rest of the\nlibrary. If you are not familiar with unit testing, have a look at the existing\nexamples - they should be easy to apply to your work.\n\n**Convention Tests:**\n\n`.\\build.ps1 -Target ConventionTests` or `./build.sh --target=ConventionTests`\n\nAlternatively, you can run the `Octokit.Tests.Conventions` assembly in the Visual Studio test runner.\n\nThese tests verify conventions and structure across the entire codebase -\nensuring everything is consistent and predictable. When writing new features,\nthese tests may fail and should help indicate where the changes have violated\nthe conventions, so feel free to run them locally while you're working on new\nfeatures.\n\n#### Slow Tests\n\n**Integration Tests**\n\nOctokit has integration tests that access the GitHub API, but they require a\nbit of setup to run. The tests make use of a set of test accounts accessed via\ncredentials stored in environment variables.\n\nRun the following interactive script to set the necessary environment\nvariables:\n\n`.\\script\\configure-integration-tests.ps1`\n\nNOTE: On Linux/OSX the environment variables currently need to be configured manually.\n\nAfter running this, ensure any existing instances of Visual Studio are restarted\nso they pick up the new environment variables are detected.\n\nWith these variables set, you can run the integration tests locally using\n\n`.\\build.ps1 -Target IntegrationTests` or `./build.sh --target=IntegrationTests`\n\nAlternatively, you can run the `Octokit.Tests.Integration` assembly in the Visual Studio test runner.\n\n**Note:** as the integration tests rely on using the actual GitHub API, you will encounter\nAPI rate limit/abuse detection issues if running the tests too frequently. Please use a test account\nso that your main account is not impacted in the event that the tests trigger the GitHub abuse\ndetection mechanism.\n\n### Testing Documentation\n\nIf you are making changes to the documentation for Octokit, you can test these\nchanges locally using the [guide](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/blob/main/docs/contributing.md)\nunder the `docs` folder.\n\n### Submitting Changes\n\nYou can publish your branch from GitHub for Windows, or run this command from\nthe Git Shell:\n\n`git push origin MY-BRANCH-NAME`\n\nOnce your changes are ready to be reviewed, publish the branch to GitHub and\n[open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)\nagainst it.\n\nA few suggestions when opening a pull request:\n\n - if you are addressing a particular issue, reference it like this:\n\n>   Fixes #1145\n\n - prefix the title with `[WIP]` to indicate this is a work-in-progress. It's\n   always good to get feedback early, so don't be afraid to open the PR before\n   it's \"done\".\n - use [checklists](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)\n   to indicate the tasks which need to be done, so everyone knows how close you\n   are to done.\n - add comments to the PR about things that are unclear or you would like\n   suggestions on\n\nSome things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:\n\n* Follow existing code conventions. Most of what we do follows [standard .NET\n  conventions](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md) except in a few places. We include a ReSharper team settings file.\n* Include unit tests that would otherwise fail without your code, but pass with\n  it.\n* Update the documentation, the surrounding one, examples elsewhere, guides,\n  whatever is affected by your contribution\n\n# Additional Resources\n\n* [Octokit Codebase Overview](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/blob/main/OVERVIEW.md)\n* [General GitHub documentation](http://help.github.com/)\n"

For example, when you navigate to the\n[Issues API](http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/) you'll notice there's an\nendpoint for issues. But in the right navbar, there are other APIs such as\n[Assignees](http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/assignees/) and\n[Milestones](http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/milestones/).\n\nWe've tried to mirror this structure. So the `IObservableMilestoneClient` isn't\na direct property of `IObservableGitHubClient`. Instead, it's a property of the\n`IObservableIssuesClient`. And thus you can get to it by going to\n`client.Issues.Milestones`.\n"
