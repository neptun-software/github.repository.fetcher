For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\nAdapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\nEffective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\nExceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\nLicensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\nLicensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\nLicensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\nShare means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\nSui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\nYou means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License.

The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\nDownstream recipients.\nOffer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nNo downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\nNo endorsement.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n"

[Visual Studio 2019][VS]\n2. [Node.js][NodeJs] v16 (v18 breaks our build)\n\n### Optional additional software\n\nSome projects in the Visual Studio solution require optional or 3rd party components to open.\nThey are not required to build the full solution from the command line using MSBuild,\nbut installing this software will facilitate an enhanced developer experience in Visual Studio.\n\n1. [Node.js Tools for Visual Studio][NodeJsTools]\n\nAll other dependencies are acquired via NuGet or NPM.\n\n## Building\n\nTo build this repository from the command line, you must first execute our init.ps1 script,\nwhich downloads NuGet.exe and uses it to restore packages.\nAssuming your working directory is the root directory of this git repo,\nand you are running Windows PowerShell, the command is:\n\n    .\\init.ps1\n\nMost of the repo may be built via building the solution file from Visual Studio 2019,\nbut for a complete build, build from the VS2019 Developer Command Prompt:\n\n    .\\build.ps1\n\nThis repo is structured such that it builds the NuGet package first, using MSBuild.\nIt then builds an NPM package that includes some of the outputs of MSBuild, along with\nsome javascript, for our NPM consumers who want a reasonable versioning story for their\nNPM packages too.\n\n## Testing\n\n`dotnet test` will run all tests.\n\nThe Visual Studio 2022 Test Explorer will list and execute all tests.\n\nA few tests will fail without a certain VC++ toolset installed.\n\n## Releases\n\nUse `nbgv tag` to create a tag for a particular commit that you mean to release.\n[Learn more about `nbgv` and its `tag` and `prepare-release` commands](https://dotnet.github.io/Nerdbank.GitVersioning/docs/nbgv-cli.html).\n\nPush the tag.\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\nWhen your repo is hosted by GitHub and you are using GitHub Actions, you should create a GitHub Release using the standard GitHub UI.\nHaving previously used `nbgv tag` and pushing the tag will help you identify the precise commit and name to use for this release.\n\nAfter publishing the release, the `.github\\workflows\\release.yml` workflow will be automatically triggered, which will:\n\n1. Find the most recent `.github\\workflows\\build.yml` GitHub workflow run of the tagged release.\n1. Upload the `deployables` artifact from that workflow run to your GitHub Release.\n1. If you have `NUGET_API_KEY` defined as a secret variable for your repo or org, any nuget packages in the `deployables` artifact will be pushed to nuget.org.\n\n### Azure Pipelines\n\nWhen your repo builds with Azure Pipelines, use the `azure-pipelines/release.yml` pipeline.\nTrigger the pipeline by adding the `auto-release` tag on a run of your main `azure-pipelines.yml` pipeline.\n\n## Tutorial and API documentation\n\nAPI and hand-written docs are found under the `docfx/` directory. and are built by [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).\n\nYou can make changes and host the site locally to preview them by switching to that directory and running the `dotnet docfx --serve` command.\nAfter making a change, you can rebuild the docs site while the localhost server is running by running `dotnet docfx` again from a separate terminal.\n\nThe `.github/workflows/docs.yml` GitHub Actions workflow publishes the content of these docs to github.io if the workflow itself and [GitHub Pages is enabled for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).\n\n## Pull requests\n\nPull requests are welcome! They may contain additional test cases (e.g. to demonstrate a failure),\nand/or product changes (with bug fixes or features). All product changes should be accompanied by\nadditional tests to cover and justify the product change unless the product change is strictly an\nefficiency improvement and no outwardly observable change is expected.\n\nIn the master branch, all tests should always pass. Added tests that fail should be marked as Skip\nvia `[Fact(Skip = \"Test does not pass yet\")]` or similar message to keep our test pass rate at 100%.\n\n [VS]: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/\n [NodeJs]: https://nodejs.org\n [NodeJsTools]: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/node-js/\n\n## Updating dependencies\n\nThis repo uses Renovate to keep dependencies current.\nConfiguration is in the `.github/renovate.json` file.\n[Learn more about configuring Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/).\n\nWhen changing the renovate.json file, follow [these validation steps](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-validation/).\n\nIf Renovate is not creating pull requests when you expect it to, check that the [Renovate GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/renovate) is configured for your account or repo.\n"

Prioritize absolute build reproducibility. Every single commit can be built and produce a unique version.\n2. No dependency on tags. Tags can be added to existing commits at any time. Clones may not fetch tags. No dependency on tags means better build reproducibility.\n3. No dependency on branch names. Branches come and go, and a commit may belong to any number of branches. Regardless of the branch HEAD may be attached to, the build should be identical.\n4. The computed version information is based on an author-defined major.minor version and an optional unstable tag, plus a shortened git commit ID.\n5. This project is supported by the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org).\n\nCheck out our [getting started documentation](https://dotnet.github.io/Nerdbank.GitVersioning/docs/getting-started.html).\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant to clarify expected behavior in our community.\nFor more information see the [.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).\n\n [semver]: http://semver.org\n [GitHeightMinimum]: https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning/issues/102#issuecomment-269591960\n"

Useful in pipelines with the `NuGetAuthenticate` task, as a workaround for https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider/issues/244.\n    This switch is ignored and installation is skipped when -NoPrerequisites is specified.\n.PARAMETER UpgradePrerequisites\n    Takes time to install prerequisites even if they are already present in case they need to be upgraded.\n    No effect if -NoPrerequisites is specified.\n.PARAMETER NoRestore\n    Skips the package restore step.\n.PARAMETER NoToolRestore\n    Skips the dotnet tool restore step.\n.PARAMETER AccessToken\n    An optional access token for authenticating to Azure Artifacts authenticated feeds.\n.PARAMETER Interactive\n    Runs NuGet restore in interactive mode.
