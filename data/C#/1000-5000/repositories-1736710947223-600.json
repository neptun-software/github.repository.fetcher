Optimisations were to\n\n- Eliminate initialization overhead, which can lead to a reduced time of up to 50%\n- Optimize operations in rules to make them scale better, another improvement of around 50%\n- The formatter used to re-parse the script in between every rule run but this is skipped now if the previous rule did not emit a `DiagnosticRecord` as it means the script text hasn't changed and doesn't need updating. Therefore formatting will be faster on scripts that need no to little changes.\n\nA small improvement was made to a script analysis rule as well but the gain is offset by the addition of the new rules in this release.\n\nThe PRs for those improvements are:\n\n- Eliminate Regex overhead in AvoidTrailingWhitespace -> Speedup of 5% (PowerShell 5.1) or 2.5 % (PowerShell 7.1-preview.2) (#1465) (by @bergmeister)\n- Formatter: Recycle parsed AST and tokens in between rule invocations when no correction was applied to improve performance (#1462) (by @bergmeister)\n- Improve performance of UseConsistentIndentation even more > another 10% speedup for formatter (#1461) (by @bergmeister)\n- Improve performance of UseConsistentIndentation -> 35% speedup for formatter (#1458) (by @bergmeister)\n- Lazy initialisation of LinkedList in TokenOperations constructor -> 7% performance gain for formatter (#1453) (by @bergmeister)\n- Invoke-Formatter: Skip VariableAnalysis, which is not needed to yield a 50% performance improvement (#1451) (by @bergmeister)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix edge case of PSUseConsistentIndentation for non-default value (IncreaseIndentationForFirstPipeline/IncreaseIndentationAfterEveryPipeline) (#1423) (by @bergmeister)\n- Fix rule suppression ID in compat rules (#1432) (by @rjmholt)\n- Changes to build analyzer for PS7 and PS6 and ship in separate directories and bump version to 1.19.0 (#1425) (by @JamesWTruher)\n- Use AST to determine SupportsShouldProcess when an error is thrown (#1397) (by @rjmholt)\n- Fix false positive of AvoidAlias rule for implicit aliasing of Get- commands for the CommandType ExternalScript (#1386) (by @bergmeister)\n\n### Build/Tests/Maintenance\n\n- Changelog for 1.19.0 (#1448) (by @bergmeister)\n- Use separate test.yaml files files since param passing of pwsh still doesn't seem to fully work correctly #1466 (by @bergmeister)\n- New build scripts for release pipeline (#1442) (by @JamesWTruher)\n- Make sure that tests always get uploaded, due to too much YAML indentation, condition was not applied (#1455) (by @bergmeister)\n- Cleanup csproj files: Remove code duplication for Configuration and entries in Rules project, since it depends on Engine project (#1450) (by @bergmeister)\n- Build: Use logging command as a temporary workaround due to billing bug preventing upload of pipeline artefacts (#1464) (by @bergmeister)\n- Use bracket syntax for passing yaml parameter (#1449) (by @bergmeister)\n- Update Newtonsoft.Json from 12.0.2 to 12.0.3 in Compatibility project as well (#1447) (by @bergmeister)\n- Replace usage of $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path with $PSScriptRoot and cleanup tests as a preparation for Pester v5 (#1438) (by @bergmeister)\n- Compatibility tests: Use correct genericVerCases test case and remove invalid test case (#1440) (by @bergmeister)\n- Add out folder to .gitignore (#1443) (by @bergmeister)\n- Pin major version of Pester to 4 and upgrade Pester version for WMF4 build (#1433) (by @bergmeister)\n- ms-vscode.csharp to ms-dotnettools.csharp (#1424) (thanks @devlead!)\n- Upgrade .net sdk to latest path (#1421) (by @bergmeister)\n- Fix #1417 modulehelp false positives (#1418) (thanks @Jawz84!)\n- Increase macOs CI coverage to include both 10.14 and 10.15 as 10.15 has recently been added to Azure DevOps hosted agents (#1412) (by @bergmeister)\n- Fix vmImage entries in build to match description (#1409) (by @bergmeister)\n- Update .Net Core SDK from 3.1.100 to latest patch 3.1.101 (#1405) (by @bergmeister)\n- Multi-stage pipelines (to split build->test) (#1404) (by @bergmeister)\n- Use vmImage in yaml and merge build definitions into 1 by using jobs.

Furthermore it ups the minimum version of PowerShell Core to `6.2.0` due to `6.1` reaching its [end of life](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/PowerShell-Support-Lifecycle#powershell-end-of-support-dates) this month.\n\n- Change CommandInfoCache to implement IDisposable and clean up the runspace pool (#1335) (by @JamesWTruher)\n- Update Newtonsoft json to 12.0.1 due to PowerShell 6.1 going out of support (#1336) (by @bergmeister)\n\n## [1.18.2](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.18.2) - 2019-09-03\n\nThis release mainly brings fixes and enhancements that are especially useful when being consumed by PowerShellEditorServices.\nThe benefit to the user will be some enhancements and fixes in the formatter, especially around multiline commands. In addition to that, error messages emitted when using invalid syntax in the setting file are now much more meaningful and actionable.\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Compatibility Analysis\n  - Fix profile collection on non-Windows, add PS 7 profiles (#1260) (by @rjmholt)\n\n- Formatter\n  - Fix PSCloseBrace rule to not wrongly flag closing brace of one-line hashtable, which lead to incorrect formatting (#1309) (by @bergmeister)\n  - PipelineIndentationStyle (when not being set to NoIndentation)\n    - PipelineIndentationStyle: Fix edge case where pipeline was incorrectly detected to span multiple lines due to backticks in the command leading up to the pipeline (#1312) (by @bergmeister)\n    - Fix edge case when PipelineIndentationStyle is not set to NoIndentation (pipeline operator spanning only one line but PipelineAst spanning multiple lines) (#1261) (by @bergmeister)\n  - Allow formatter to optionally correct aliases (#1277) (by @bergmeister)\n\n- Engine\n  - Work around runspacepool deadlock (#1316) (by @rjmholt)\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Formatter\n  - Fix Indentation of multiline command with backticks after comment line (#1318) (by @bergmeister)\n- Code Analysis:\n  - Enhance UseDeclaredVarsMoreThanAssignments to detect also take into account the usage of Get-Variable with an array of variables and usage of named - parameter -Name (#1310) (by @bergmeister)\n- Settings files\n  - Actionable errors from incorrect settings files (#1263) (thanks @travis-c-lagrone!)\n  - Update engine resource string 'WrongKeyHashTable' to include all valid settings hashtable keys (#1273) (thanks @travis-c-lagrone!)\n- Add icon and add reference in readme and manifest (#1291) (by @bergmeister, thanks @adilio for creating the logo!)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Update readme with changes to default branch being master now (#1265) (by @bergmeister)\n- UseApprovedVerbs.md: Improving Documentation (#1294) (Thanks @Banner-Keith!)\n- Update documentation for parameter \"Settings\" of command \"Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer\" to include the key \"RecurseCustomRulesPath\" - (#1272) (thanks @travis-c-lagrone!)\n\n### Build\n\n- Don't sign the compatability collector catalog so that PSScriptAnalyzer can ship with a catalog file again (#1328) (by @JamesWTruher)\n- Fix Ubuntu Appveyor build (#1320) (by @bergmeister, thanks @JamesWTruher for the initial investigation)\n\n## [1.18.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.18.1) - 2019-06-12\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Formatter\n  - UseCorrectCasing\n    - Do not use alias name as key for command info cache to fix the problem where UseCorrectCasing corrects aliases (#1216) (by @bergmeister)\n    - Fix wildcard lookups for command lookup and do not append .exe for applications on Windows (#1210) (by @bergmeister)\n    - Do not correct applications or script paths at all (#1255) (by @bergmeister)\n  - Prevent PSCloseBrace crash if hashtable definition start on first token and there is a PSCloseBrace violation (#1235) (by @bergmeister)\n  - PipelineIndentationStyle\n    - Fix formatting regression in 1.18.0 whereby single-line pipeline reduces indentation level incorrectly (#1191) (by @bergmeister)\n    - Make IncreaseIndentationForFirstPipeline the true default option for PipelineIndentationStyle option (#1218) (by @bergmeister)\n\n- Compatibility Rules\n  - Fix UseCompatibleSyntax class error message (#1215) (by @rjmholt)\n  - Convert compatibility module to binary module, fix compatibility with Azure environments (#1212) (by @rjmholt)\n  - Prevent .NET members with names differing only by case from crashing the compatibility profiler (#1195) (by @rjmholt)\n  - Fix compatibility profile query API so that aliases referring to other modules appear (#1194) (by @rjmholt)\n\n- DSC\n  - Instead of using the first cimClass and then having no superClass, use the first cimClass that has a non-null superClass (#1200) (by @bergmeister, thanks to @ykuijs! for the great collaboration)\n  - Make `-SaveDscDependency` work on Linux (#1246) (by @bergmeister)\n\n- Enable suppression of custom rules when used together with `-IncludeDefaultRules` to allow all possible scenarios from 1.17.1 and 1.18.0.

(#1165)\n- Updated used version of `Newtonsoft.Json` to `11.0.2`. (#1165) (by @bergmeister)\n- Command data files of PowerShell `6.0` were removed. Updated files for PowerShell `6.1` were added. This means that users that have customized the `UseCompatibleCmdlets` rule, need to either adapt the version string as per rule documentation or can alternatively copy in the old command data files into the `Settings` installation folder (#1075) (by @bergmeister)\n- The minimum required runtime of the full .Net Framework was raised from `4.5.1` to `4.5.2` as `4.5.1` is not supported any more.

On the other hand when the switch is set to `$true`, the emitted suggested corrections enforce branching controls statements to be on the next line.\n\nMany thanks to @rkeithhill for contributing the _Stroustrup_ style code formatting preset.\n\n## [1.14.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.14.1) - 2017-06-12\n\n### Fixed\n- (#777) `Invoke-Formatter`\n    - Make the cmdlet parameters positional.\n    - Updated documentation so that `Get-Help Invoke-Formatter -Syntax` returns a valid syntax.\n\n## [1.14.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.14.0) - 2017-06-09\n\n### Added\n- (#772) [`Invoke-Formatter`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/4f47ef95edd045029628ba9a4079b1dda19f080f/docs/markdown/Invoke-Formatter.md) cmdlet to format PowerShell scripts. The cmdlet takes a script string and a settings file and outputs formatted script string based on the provided settings. If no settings are provided, the formatter uses the default `CodeFormatting` settings, which can be found at `Settings/CodeFormatting.psd1`.\n\n### Fixed\n- (#770) `PSUseIdenticalMandatoryParametersForDSC` rule violation extent. The violation extent covers only the relevant function name, which prior the fix would mark the entire script. This prevented rule suppression from working when the suppression is declared inside `Get/Set/Test` functions.\n- (#770) `PSUseIdenticalMandatoryParametersForDSC` behavior to look for mandatory parameters in `Get/Set/Test` functions in a script based resource only if they are declared with attributes, `Key` or `Required`, in the corresponding `mof` file.\n\n## [1.13.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.13.0) - 2017-05-18\n\n### Added\n- [`PSUseSupportsShouldProcess`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/f92dabdef61b87d5f9f9f2140739c9f3f210b2d8/RuleDocumentation/UseSupportsShouldProcess.md) rule to discourage manual `whatif` and `confirm` parameter declarations.\n- Suggested corrections to [`PSProvideCommentHelp`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/f92dabdef61b87d5f9f9f2140739c9f3f210b2d8/RuleDocumentation/ProvideCommentHelp.md) rule. The rule can now be configured to:\n    - trigger on non-exported functions. But by default, the rule triggers only on exported functions that do have comment help.\n    - place the suggested corrections either before a function definition, or at the beginning or end of a function's body.\n    - choose between block comment or line comment style of suggested comment help correction.\n\n### Fixed\n- `PSAlignAssignmentStatement` to align assignment statements in DSC configurations that have *Undefined DSC Resource* parse errors.\n\n## [1.12.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.12.0) - 2017-05-09\n\n### Added\n- [PSAlignAssignmentRuleStatement](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/cca9a2d7ee35be7322f8c5a09b6c500a0a8bd101/RuleDocumentation/AlignAssignmentStatement.md) rule to align assignment statements in property value pairs (#753).\n\n### Fixed\n- `PSAvoidGlobalVars` rule to ignore `$global:lastexitcode` (#752).\n- `PSUseConsistentIndentation` to account for backtick on preceding line (#749).\n- `PSPlaceCloseBrace` to ignore one-line blocks when `NewLineAfter` switch is on (#748).\n\n## [1.11.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.11.1) - 2017-04-04\n### Fixed\n- CodeFormatting settings file (#727, #728).\n- Allowlist aliases comparison in AvoidUsingCmdletAliases rule (#739).\n- PlaceCloseBrace rule behavior for NewLineAfter option (#741).\n- UseConsistentIndentation rule to ignore open brace in magic methods (#744).\n\n## [1.11.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.11.0) - 2017-03-01\n### Added\n- Built-in settings presets to specify settings from command line (#717). Currently, PSSA ships with `PSGallery`, `CodeFormatting`, `DSC`, and other settings presets. All of them can be found in the `Settings/` directory in the module. To use them just pass them as an argument to the `Settings` parameter. For example, if you want to run rules that *powershellgallery* runs, then use the following command.\n```powershell\nPS> Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path /path/to/your/module -Settings PSGallery\n```\n- Argument completion for built-in settings presets (#717).\n- Argument completion for `IncludeRule` and `ExcludeRule` parameters (#717).\n- Option to `PSCloseBrace` rule to add new line after the brace (#713).\n- Option to `PSCloseBrace` rule to ignore expressions that have open and close braces on the same line (#706).\n- New rule, [PSUseConsistentWhitespace](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/9a6fe537c11c9c8d7ed872a7464eb192cab00883/RuleDocumentation/UseConsistentWhitespace.md), to check for whitespace style around operators and separators (#702).\n\n### Fixed\n- Indentation when pipes precede new lines in a multi-line command expression in `PSUseConsistentIdentation` rule (#705).\n- Handling of SubExpressionAsts (`$(...)`) in `PSUseConsistentIdentation` rule (#700).\n- Performance issues caused by `get-command` cmdlet (#695).\n\n### Changed\n- Settings implementation to decouple it from engine (#717).\n\n## [1.10.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.10.0) - 2017-01-19\n### Added\n- Three rules to enable code formatting feature in vscode (#690)\n    - [PSPlaceOpenBrace](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/03a6e2b4ee24894bf574a8a8ce911d03680da607/RuleDocumentation/PlaceOpenBrace.md)\n    -

PSScriptAnalyzer\nchecks the quality of PowerShell code by running a [set of rules](docs/Rules). The rules are based\non PowerShell best practices identified by PowerShell Team and the community. It generates\nDiagnosticResults (errors and warnings) to inform users about potential code defects and suggests\npossible solutions for improvements.\n\nPSScriptAnalyzer ships with a collection of built-in rules that check various aspects of\nPowerShell code such as:\n\n- The presence of uninitialized variables\n- Use of **PSCredential** type\n- Use of `Invoke-Expression`\n- And many more\n\n[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## DOCUMENTATION NOTICE\n\nConceptual user documentation has been moved out of the source code repository and into the\ndocumentation repository so that it can be published on learn.microsoft.com.\n\nThe goal of this migration is to have the user documentation on learn.microsoft.com. The source code\nrepository should only contain documentation for the code base, such as how to build the code or how\nto contribute to the code.\n\nUser documentation that has been migrated:\n\n- Most of the contents of this README can be found in the\n  [PSScriptAnalyzer overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/overview)\n- For cmdlet reference, see\n  [PSScriptAnalyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/psscriptanalyzer)\n- For rules, see\n  [Rules overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/rules/readme)\n- The `PowerShellBestPractices.md` content has been moved to\n  [PSScriptAnalyzer rules and recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/rules-recommendations)\n- The `ScriptRuleDocumentation.md` content has been moved to\n  [Creating custom rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/create-custom-rule)\n\nThere is one exception - the documentation for the rules and cmdlets will remain in the [docs](docs)\nfolder to facilitate build testing and to be archived as part of each release. Only the\ndocumentation for the latest release is published on on learn.microsoft.com.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install **PSScriptAnalyzer** from the PowerShell Gallery, see\n[Installing PSScriptAnalyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/overview#installing-psscriptanalyzer).\n\nTo install **PSScriptAnalyzer** from source code:\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [Latest .NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)\n* If building for Windows PowerShell versions, then the .NET Framework 4.6.2 [targeting pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net462) (also referred to as developer/targeting pack) need to be installed. This is only possible on Windows.\n* Optionally but recommended for development: [Visual Studio 2017/2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads)\n- [Pester v5 PowerShell module, available on PowerShell Gallery](https://github.com/pester/Pester)\n- [PlatyPS PowerShell module, available on PowerShell Gallery](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS/releases)\n- Optionally but recommended for development: [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads)\n\n### Steps\n\n- Obtain the source\n  - Download the latest source code from the\n    [release page](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/releases) OR\n  - Clone the repository (needs git)\n\n    ```powershell\n    git clone https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer\n    ```\n\n- Navigate to the source directory\n\n  ```powershell\n  cd path/to/PSScriptAnalyzer\n  ```\n\n- Building You can either build using the `Visual Studio` solution `PSScriptAnalyzer.sln` or build\n  using `PowerShell` specifically for your platform as follows:\n  - The default build is for the currently used version of PowerShell\n\n    ```powershell\n    .\\build.ps1\n    ```\n\n  - Windows PowerShell version 5.0\n\n    ```powershell\n    .\\build.ps1 -PSVersion 5\n    ```\n\n  - Windows PowerShell version 4.0\n\n    ```powershell\n    .\\build.ps1 -PSVersion 4\n    ```\n\n  - Windows PowerShell version 3.0\n\n    ```powershell\n    .\\build.ps1 -PSVersion 3\n    ```\n\n  - PowerShell 7\n\n    ```powershell\n    .\\build.ps1 -PSVersion 7\n    ```\n\n- Rebuild documentation since it gets built automatically only the first time\n\n  ```powershell\n  .\\build.ps1 -Documentation\n  ```\n\n- Build all versions (PowerShell v3, v4, v5, and v6) and documentation\n\n  ```powershell\n  .\\build.ps1 -All\n  ```\n\n- Import the module\n\n  ```powershell\n  Import-Module .\\out\\PSScriptAnalyzer\\[version]\\PSScriptAnalyzer.psd1\n  ```\n\nTo confirm installation: run `Get-ScriptAnalyzerRule` in the PowerShell console to obtain the\nbuilt-in rules.\n\n- Adding/Removing resource strings\n\n  For adding/removing resource strings in the `*.resx` files, it is recommended to use\n  `Visual Studio` since it automatically updates the strongly typed `*.Designer.cs` files. The\n  `Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition` is free to use but should you not have/want to use\n  `Visual Studio` then you can either manually adapt the `*.Designer.cs` files or use the\n  `New-StronglyTypedCsFileForResx.ps1` script although the latter is discouraged since it leads to a\n  bad diff of the `*.Designer.cs` files.\n\n### Tests\n\nPester-based ScriptAnalyzer Tests are located in `path/to/PSScriptAnalyzer/Tests` folder.\n\n- Ensure [Pester](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Pester) of at least version 5.3 is installed\n- In the root folder of your local repository, run:\n\n```powershell\n./build -Test\n```\n\nTo retrieve the results of the run, you can use the tools which are part of the build module (`build.psm1`)\n\n```powershell\nImport-Module ./build.psm1\nGet-TestResults\n```\n\nTo retrieve only the errors, you can use the following:\n\n```powershell\nImport-Module ./build.psm1\nGet-TestFailures\n```\n\n[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Using PSScriptAnalyzer\n\nThe documentation in this section can be found in\n[Using PSScriptAnalyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/using-scriptanalyzer).\n\n## Contributions are welcome\n\nThere are many ways to contribute:\n\n1. Open a new bug report, feature request or just ask a question by opening a\n   [new issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/new/choose).\n2. Participate in the discussions of\n   [issues](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues),\n   [pull requests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/pulls) and test fixes or new\n   features.\n3. Submit your own fixes or features as a pull request but please discuss it beforehand in an issue.\n4. Submit test cases.\n\n[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Creating a Release\n\n- Update changelog (`changelog.md`) with the new version number and change set. When updating the\n  changelog please follow the same pattern as that of previous change sets (otherwise this may break\n  the next step).\n- Import the ReleaseMaker module and execute `New-Release` cmdlet to perform the following actions.\n  - Update module manifest (engine/PSScriptAnalyzer.psd1) with the new version number and change set\n  - Update the version number in `Engine/Engine.csproj` and `Rules/Rules.csproj`\n  - Create a release build in `out/`\n\n```powershell\nImport-Module .\\Utils\\ReleaseMaker.psm1\nNew-Release\n```\n\n- Sign the binaries and PowerShell files in the release build and publish the module to\n  [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com).\n- Draft a new release on github and tag `master` with the new version number.\n\n[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease see our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in this project.\n\n[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)\n\n## Security Policy\n\nFor any security issues, please see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).\n\n[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)\n"
