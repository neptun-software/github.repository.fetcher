          "content": "# IKVM - Java Virtual Machine for .NET\n\n## Build\n\nThe project can be opened in Visual Studio, or it can be be built with MSBuild on a Windows host. The project cannot currently be built on a Linux host, nor with an exclusively .NET Core version of MSBuild.\n\nPrerequisites for building the project:\n* A clone of the IKVM repository which includes submodules (e.g. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ikvmnet/ikvm.git`)\n* Visual Studio configured for: .NET desktop development, Desktop development with C++ (including C++ Clang tools for Windows), Linux and Embedded Development with C++, and Windows SDK with the appropriate libraries for x86, AMD64 and ARM64 development.\n* A JDK 8 installation. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable needs to be point to the JDK 8 directory, or the version of `javac` available on the path needs to be from JDK 8 (You can download a suitable JDK from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/))\n* SDK Toolkits: These are located in the `ext/ikvm-native-sdk/` directory, and consist of a Windows SDK (windows), Linux SDK (linux) and Mac OS X SDK (macosx). The SDKs can be retrieved from the releases of the `ikvm-native-sdk` project.\n  * We use IKVM.Clang projects to build the native libraries. This project type supports inner builds for TargetMachine, much as .NET supports inner builds for TFMs.\n  * There is an IKVM.Clang Visual Studio extension for these projects to load properly in Visual Studio: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ikvm.clang\n  * When on Windows, the Windows SDK distributed through this project is not required. But it is required that you have a Windows SDK installed. Building on other operating systems requires all of the SDKs.\n    * A few of the SDKs contain symlinks for which there is no way to extract them properly (osx) on Windows. We find 7zip has the best capability to produce SYMLINK files, though it incorrectly interpretes symlinks to directories as symlinks to files. The Fix-SymbolicLinks.ps1 script is provided to patch these up post extraction. For building Linux, the `win` SDK package is required. For building on OS X the `win-ci` package is required. The former has symbolic links setup for various versions of header files that exist with different required cases. While the latter is suitable for a case-insensitive OS.\n  * The Linux SDK contains a version for all of the required platforms. These are required to cross compile to each supported platform. They must all be present.\n* LLVM installed with `clang` available on the path. LLVM is shipped with Visual Studio, but you will need to update your PATH to include the relevant bin directory (typically: `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\Llvm\\bin`) or you can install a [standalone distribution of LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/). If building on Windows, ensure you do not build within the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt as clang is unable to properly discover the Windows SDK when this is applied.\n* 200GB of free disk space\n* If building the OS X libraries or binaries (on by default) the 'rcodesign' utility is required for ad-hoc signing. This utility allows one to sign executables for Mac OS X from within Windows or Linux. It is available from the Rust crate named 'apple-codesign'. For more information, see https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/0.22.0/.\n \n Once the prerequisites are in place, to build IKVM from the command line you will use the following commands:\n\n ```\n dotnet restore IKVM.sln\n msbuild IKVM.dist.msbuildproj\n ```\n\n## Project\n\n+ IKVM.sln\n  Main solution file for the project.\n+ IKVM.dist.msbuildproj\n  MSBuild project file that builds the output artifacts, including the NuGet packages.\n+ IKVM.Runtime\n  The main executable core of IKVM. Provides services used by IKVM.Java.\n+ IKVM.Java\n  The OpenJDK distribution included with IKVM. This project is heavily customized to compile the OpenJDK Java source files and produce a .NET assembly from them.\n+ IKVM.Image\n  Outputs the files that make up the Java Runtime Image base. That is, the lib/ directory.\n+ IKVM.Image.JRE\n  Outputs the files that make up the Java Runtime Image JRE. That is, the contents of the bin/ directory typically associated with a JRE (java.exe, policytool.exe, etc).\n+ IKVM.Image.JRE.runtime.*\n  Outputs the runtime-specific files that make up the Java Runtime Image JRE.\n+ IKVM.Image.JDK\n  Outputs the files that make up the Java Runtime Image JDK. That is, the contents of the bin/ directory typically associated with a JDK (javac.exe, etc).\n+ IKVM.Image.JDK.runtime.*\n  Outputs the runtime-specific files that make up the Java Runtime Image JDK.\n+ ikvmc\n  `ikvmc` executable. Transforms Java class files or JAR files into .NET libraries or executables.\n+ ikvmstub\n  `ikvmstub` executable. Generates Java JAR files for .NET assemblies. When building Java code that depends on .NET code, these stubs can be used as references.\n+ IKVM.Tests\n  Various unit tests against IKVM functionality.\n+ IKVM.Runtime-ref\n  \"Reference\" version of the IKVM.Runtime project. Due to a circular dependency between IKVM.Java and IKVM.Runtime, IKVM.Java must build against a partial copy of IKVM.Runtime.\n+ IKVM.Java-ref\n  \"Reference\" version of the IKVM.Java project. Due to the circular dependency between IKVM.Java and IKVM.Runtime, IKVM.Runtime must build against a partial copy of IKVM.Java.\n+ IKVM\n  To untangle the ProjectReferences between the circular dependencies, this project generates the NuGet package output, including all of it's required dependencies, and the full version of the underlying IKVM assemblies.\n+ ikvm-native-*\n  Native vcxproj files for building 'ikvm-native'. This code facilitates the functionality of IKVM.Runtime.JNI.\n+ IKVM.MSBuild\n  Contains tasks and targets used by both the IKVM package and the IKVM.NET.Sdk package. Two divergent paths exist: Tasks and NoTasks. When doing in-tree builds, NoTasks is used.\n+ IKVM.MSBuild.Tasks\n  Source code for the task contained within IKVM.MSBuild.\n+ IKVM.NET.Sdk\n  MSBuild SDK package which provides support for building managed code form Java sources. To divergent paths exist: Tasks and NoTasks. When doing in-tree builds, NoTasks is used.\n+ dist-*\n  Outputs content files that describe the summation of various directories to be produced when doing a distribution build.\n+ IKVM.Tools.Runner\n  Various .NET libraries for executing the IKVM tools programatically. These are used by the MSBuild Tasks to launch ikvmc.exe and ikvmstub.exe.\n+ IKVM.Java.Extensions\n  Various extension methods and such for bridiging IKVM.Java with .NET patterns and practices.\n\n## Versioning\n\nIKVM uses the Semantic Versioning specification, with a unique twist. Since the project tracks compatibility with the Java SE specification, the major version is always the version of the JDK we claim to support. Otherwise major/breaking IKVM releases are denoted by an increment of the minor version. Other releases are denoted by an increment of the patch version.\n\nSemantic Versioning is accomplished automatically by GitVersion in Mainline mode. The `main` branch functions as the release branch. Every commit to main results in an increment of the patch version and a release. The `develop` branch represents a prerelease staging area. Builds within the `develop` branch inherit the NEXT version number of the `main` branch, with a prerelease tag followed by the number of commit separating develop from the last release.\n\nIncreases in the major and minor version are accomplished manually by introducing a commit with a message containing a line such as `+semver: major` or `+semver: minor`. The process of creating a new major or minor release is simply to bump the version with the introduction of a commit message. The GitHub Actions should automatically generate the git tag and GitHub release, and publish the proper NuGet packages to the proper places.\n\n# Package Layout\n\nThe main IKVM package is 'IKVM'. This package contains the IKVM.Runtime, IKVM.Java assemblies, and the\nlibikvm native library. This is the minimal set of files required to begin bootstrapping the JVM. However, the JVM\nitself requires additional files which are present in the IKVM.Image package hierarchy.\n\nThe IKVM.Image set of packages contains per-TFM and per-RID Java Runtime Image files. These include what you would\nnormally expect to see an a JVM distribution: a bin/ directory with binaries, native libraries, etc; as well as a\nlib/ directory with various security and property files. The IKVM Runtime Image packages are RID specific, and named\nwith the convention IKVM.Image.*.runtime.RID, much like Microsoft RID specific packages are named.\n\nThese packages deliver the additional IKVM Image directory into the output of the user's project. They do this with a\nspecial targets file provided by IKVM.Image. Each runtime package contains a MSBuild script which appends to a\nIkvmImageItem ItemGroup, where each item has a TargetFramework and RuntimeIdentifier property. The primary build script\nthen selects from this ItemGroup to match the current build configuration. Only files selected for the current TFM are\noutput. If a RID specific build is underway, only files matching that RID are selected. This populates the ikvm/{rid}\ndirectory in the user output based on the current build or publish being done, and attempts to minimize the size of\nthat output.\n\nThree levels of packages are at play: IKVM.Image.runtime.RID, IKVM.Image.JRE.runtime.RID, IKVM.Image.JDK.runtime.RID.\nThe first includes primary requirements of IKVM itself: native libraries, configuration files. The JRE image merges in\nthe executables for a JRE image (java.exe, etc). While the JDK image merges in additional executables that would be\npresent in a JDK: (javac.exe, etc). IKVM contains a direct dependency to IKVM.Image. However, IKVM.Image.JRE and\nIKVM.Image.JDK are optional.\n\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** copyright the software, and\n**(2)** offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n**0.** This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The “Program”, below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the Program”\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term “modification”.)  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n**1.** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n**2.** You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n* **a)** You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n* **b)** You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n* **c)** If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n**3.** You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n* **a)** Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n* **b)** Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n* **c)** Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n**4.** You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n**5.** You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n**6.** Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n**7.** If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n**8.** If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n**9.** The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and “any\nlater version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n**10.** If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n### NO WARRANTY\n\n**11.** BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n**12.** IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\nonly where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\nthe words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\nexception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n\n    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n\n    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.

It can be used to quickly and easily:\n\n- Execute compiled Java code (bytecode) on .NET Framework or .NET Core\n- Convert bytecode to a .NET assembly to directly access its API in a .NET project\n\nThese tasks can be done **without porting source code** to .NET.\n\n### IKVM Components\n\n* A Java virtual machine (JVM) implemented in .NET\n* A .NET implementation of the Java class libraries\n* A tool that translates Java bytecode (JAR files) to .NET IL (DLL or EXE files).\n* Tools that enable Java and .NET interoperability\n* A full JRE/JDK 8 runtime image.\n\n### Run Java Applications with .NET\n\n1. **Statically:** By compiling a Java application into a .NET assembly using `<MavenReference>`, `<IkvmReference>` or `ikvmc`.\n   - Library assemblies can be referenced by any .NET application with a compatible target framework and platform. Types can be referenced by using the Java package name like a .NET namespace.\n   - Executable assemblies can be launched by specifying the class containing the `main()` method to execute at runtime when building using `ikvmc`.\n2. **Dynamically:** By running a Java application using the `java` executable inside of the JDK Runtime Image. The Java bytecode is converted on-the-fly to CIL and executed. The experience should be identical to a normal JDK.\n\n## What IKVM is Not\n\n- A converter utility to transform Java source code to C# source code\n- A decompiler utitity to transform compiled Java bytecode to C# source code\n- A tool that runs .NET code in Java - all IKVM conversions are Java > .NET\n\n## Support\n\n- .NET Framework 4.7.2 and higher (SDK-style projects)\n- .NET 6 and higher\n- Java SE 8\n- Windows x86/x64/ARM64\n- Linux x64/ARM/ARM64 (GLIBC and MUSL)\n- Mac OS X x64/arm64\n \nVarious differences exist between support for all of our different artifacts. For instance, there are some platforms we cannot distribute images for and some platforms we cannot distribute tools for.\n\n## Installation\n\n### NuGet\n\n```console\nPM> Install-Package IKVM\n```\n\nOr, to use `MavenReference`:\n\n```console\nPM> Install-Package IKVM.Maven.Sdk\n```\n\n### Tools\n\nThe tools are available for download on the [Releases](https://github.com/ikvmnet/ikvm/releases) page.\n\n### Runtime Images\n\nBoth a JRE and JDK runtime image are available. These images are standard JRE or JDK directory structures containing all of the standard tools: javac, jdeps, policytool, keytool, etc. Some Java libraries may require either a JRE or JDK, and if so, the `IKVM.Image.JRE` or `IKVM.Image.JDK` package should be added to your project.\n\n```console\nPM> Install-Package IKVM.Image.JRE\nPM> Install-Package IKVM.Image.JDK\n```\n\nA standalone JDK distributable is available for download on the [Releases](https://github.com/ikvmnet/ikvm/releases) page. This directory structure should suffice as a `JAVA_HOME` path for standard Java applications.\n\n## Usage\n\nIKVM supports integration with .NET SDK-style projects as well as low level tools for running compiled Java code directly or for advanced build scenarios. The 2 main entry points for integration with the .NET SDK-style projects are `IkvmReference` and `MavenReference`. .NET SDK-style projects can be built on the command line directly or using an IDE that supports them, such as recent versions [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).\n\n### IkvmReference\n\nIKVM includes build-time support for translating Java libraries to .NET assemblies. Install the `IKVM` package in a project that requires references to Java libraries. Use `IkvmReference` within an `ItemGroup` to indicate which Java libraries your project requires.\n\n#### Example\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <PackageReference Include=\"IKVM\" Version=\"Version\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n\n<ItemGroup>\n  <IkvmReference Include=\"..\\..\\ext\\helloworld\\helloworld-2.0.jar\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nThe output assembly will be generated as part of your project's build process and a reference will automatically be added to your project so you can call APIs of the compiled `.jar` assembly. Additional metadata can be added to `IkvmReference` to customize the assembly that is generated.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n   <IkvmReference Include=\"..\\..\\ext\\helloworld\\helloworld-2.0.jar\">\n      <AssemblyName>MyAssembly</AssemblyName>\n      <AssemblyVersion>3.2.1.0</AssemblyVersion>\n      <AssemblyFileVersion>3.0.0.0</AssemblyFileVersion>\n      <DisableAutoAssemblyName>true</DisableAutoAssemblyName>\n      <DisableAutoAssemblyVersion>true</DisableAutoAssemblyVersion>\n      <FallbackAssemblyName>MyAssemblyFallback</FallbackAssemblyName>\n      <FallbackAssemblyVersion>3.1.0.0</FallbackAssemblyVersion>\n      <KeyFile>MyKey.snk</KeyFile>\n      <DelaySign>true</DelaySign>\n      <Compile>SomeInternalDependency.jar;SomeOtherInternalDependency.jar</Compile>\n      <Sources>MyClass.java;YourClass.java</Sources>\n      <References>SomeExternalDependency.jar;SomeOtherExternalDependency.jar</References>\n      <Aliases>MyAssemblyAlias;helloworld2_0</Aliases>\n      <Debug>portable</Debug>\n   </IkvmReference>\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\n\n#### Attributes and Elements\n\nThe following values can be used as either an attribute or a nested element of `<IkvmReference>`.\n\n| Attribute or Element  | Description  |\n|---|---|\n| `Include` (attribute only) | The identity of the `IkvmReference` item. The value can be one of: <ul><li>path to a JAR file</li><li>path to a directory</li><li>an otherwise unimportant name</li></ul> |\n| `AssemblyName` | By default the `AssemblyName` is generated using the rules defined by the [`Automatic-Module-Name` specification](#automatic-module-name-specification). To override this, do so here. The value should not include a file extension, `.dll` will be appended automatically. |\n| `AssemblyVersion` | By default the `AssemblyVersion` is generated using the rules defined by the [`Automatic-Module-Name` specification](#automatic-module-name-specification). To override this, do so here. |\n| `AssemblyFileVersion` | By default the `AssemblyFileVersion` is generated using the rules defined by the [`Automatic-Module-Name` specification](#automatic-module-name-specification) or, if overridden, the same value as `AssemblyVersion`. To override this, do so here. |\n| `DisableAutoAssemblyName` | If `true` disables detection of `AssemblyName`. |\n| `DisableAutoAssemblyVersion` | If `true` disables detection of `AssemblyVersion`. |\n| `FallbackAssemblyName` | If `AssemblyName` is not provided or cannot be calculated, use this value. |\n| `FallbackAssemblyVersion` | If `AssemblyVersion` is not provided or cannot be calculated, use this value. |\n| `KeyFile` | Specifies the filename containing the cryptographic key. When this option is used, the compiler inserts the public key from the specified file into the assembly manifest and then signs the final assembly with the private key. |\n| `DelaySign` | This option causes the compiler to reserve space in the output file so that a digital signature can be added later. Use `DelaySign` if you only want to place the public key in the assembly. The `DelaySign` option has no effect unless used with `KeyFile`. |\n| `Compile` | A semi-colon separated list of Java class path items to compile into the assembly. By default this value is the `Identity` of the item, if the identity of the item is an existing JAR file or directory (not yet supported). MSBuild globs are supported to reference multiple JAR or .class files. |\n| `Sources` | A semi-colon separated list of Java source files to use during documentation generation. (not yet supported) |\n| `References` | Optional semi-colon separated list of other `IkvmReference` identity values to specify as a reference to the current one. For example, if `foo.jar` depends on `bar.jar`, include both as `IkvmReference` items, but specify the identity of `bar.jar` on the `References` metadata of `foo.jar`. |\n| `Debug` | Optional value indicating how to generate debug symbols. By default this is determined based on the `<DebugType>` properties of the project. Only full debug symbols are currently supported. |\n| `Aliases` | A semi-colon separated list of aliases that can be used to reference the assembly in `References`. |\n| `ClassLoader` | A fully qualified classs name of the custom ClassLoader implementation to use as a delegation parent. Examples include `ikvm.runtime.AppDomainAssemblyClassLoader` and `ikvm.runtime.ClassPathAssemblyClassLoader`. |\n| All other metadata supported on the [`Reference`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-items#reference) MSBuild item group definition. | |\n\n\n`IkvmReference` is not transitive. Including it in one project and adding a dependency to that project from a second\nproject will not result in the same reference being available on the second project. Instead, add the reference to\neach project.\n\nFor each project to resolve to the same resulting assembly ensure their settings are identical.\n\nMultiple `IkvmReference` entries can be configured to include each other as references.\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n   <IkvmReference Include=\"helloworld.jar\">\n      <AssemblyVersion>1.0.0.0</AssemblyVersion>\n   </IkvmReference>\n   <IkvmReference Include=\"helloworld-2.jar\">\n      <AssemblyName>helloworld-2</AssemblyName>\n      <AssemblyVersion>2.0.0.0</AssemblyVersion>\n      <References>helloworld.jar</References>\n      <Aliases>helloworld2</Aliases>\n   </IkvmReference>\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\n#### `Automatic-Module-Name` Specification\n\nThe `Automatic-Module-Name` is either a specified attribute of the JAR manifest, which can be found in the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file inside the JAR, or a generated value based on the name of the JAR file. See the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/module/ModuleFinder.html#automatic-modules) for more information.\n\n### MavenReference\n\nSee the [ikvm-maven Readme](https://github.com/ikvmnet/ikvm-maven#readme) for usage instructions.\n\n### Notice To Project Owners\n\nThe IKVM project recommends that people do not redistribute FOSS Java libraries compiled with IKVM over public systems such as NuGet.org, unless you are the original owner of that software and have a compelling reason.\n\nCreating copies of FOSS Java libraries and publishing them to distribution mechanisms such as NuGet.org creates eco-system confusion and dependency conflicts downstream. We provide a system so that .NET users of Java libraries can reference those libraries directly out of the standard Java ecosystem mechanisms: Maven Central, etc though IKVM.Maven. Remember, very few libraries exist in a vacuum. Libraries often depend on dozens of other libraries. Two unrelated Java libraries often depend on the same underlying Java library. A complex method of dependency conflict resolution and version unification has to be involved in resolving this hierarchy for any individual downstream project. You are likely going to be introducing duplicate classes into the users of your versions, or causing your users to depend upon the wrong version of other libraries.\n\nIn addition to the above, we presently do not guarentee that API between statically compiled assemblies and the IKVM.Java and IKVM.Runtime libraries remains stable. A statically compiled assembly built against one version of IKVM is not guarenteed to run against a higher version of IKVM, even at the patch level. We would like to advertise better support for this in the future, but at present there is a lot of work planned for the IKVM.Runtime and IKVM.Java APIs that we don't want to inhibit. Since we also provide build tools to make the process of recompiling assemblies from the build machine easy, if recommendations are followed, this should be of limited impact.\n\nThere are exceptions to this advice, such as the library not being published to Maven. In that case, guidance would be to advocate that the original Java library in fact be published to Maven, or do the work yourself, as that is the appropriate place for Java libraries.\n\nWe cannot force you to conform to this advice. But for the health of the ecosystem, we urge you to take it under consideration yourself.\n"

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.

You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward.

The\n   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n\n   As a special exception we grant the free usage of UPX for all\n   executables, including commercial programs.\n   See below for details and restrictions.\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n=========\n\n   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software.

The\n   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n\n   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n\n   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n      distributed by us.\n   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n\n\nANNOTATIONS\n===========\n\n  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n\n  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n    by definition.\n\n  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\n\n  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\n    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\n    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\n\n\n\nMarkus F.X.J.
