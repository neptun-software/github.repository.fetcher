[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\n\nThis solution uses Python, Node.js, .NET, with Redis for messaging and Postgres for storage.\n\nRun in this directory to build and run the app:\n\n```shell\ndocker compose up\n```\n\nThe `vote` app will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and the `results` will be at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).\n\nAlternately, if you want to run it on a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), first make sure you have a swarm. If you don't, run:\n\n```shell\ndocker swarm init\n```\n\nOnce you have your swarm, in this directory run:\n\n```shell\ndocker stack deploy --compose-file docker-stack.yml vote\n```\n\n## Run the app in Kubernetes\n\nThe folder k8s-specifications contains the YAML specifications of the Voting App's services.\n\nRun the following command to create the deployments and services. Note it will create these resources in your current namespace (`default` if you haven't changed it.)\n\n```shell\nkubectl create -f k8s-specifications/\n```\n\nThe `vote` web app is then available on port 31000 on each host of the cluster, the `result` web app is available on port 31001.\n\nTo remove them, run:\n\n```shell\nkubectl delete -f k8s-specifications/\n```\n\n## Architecture\n\n![Architecture diagram](architecture.excalidraw.png)\n\n* A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) which lets you vote between two options\n* A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) which collects new votes\n* A [.NET](/worker/) worker which consumes votes and stores them in…\n* A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) database backed by a Docker volume\n* A [Node.js](/result) web app which shows the results of the voting in real time\n\n## Notes\n\nThe voting application only accepts one vote per client browser. It does not register additional votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.\n\nThis isn't an example of a properly architected perfectly designed distributed app... it's just a simple\nexample of the various types of pieces and languages you might see (queues, persistent data, etc), and how to\ndeal with them in Docker at a basic level.\n"
