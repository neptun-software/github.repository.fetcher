They come at the cost\nof minor but important **breaking API changes** covered below.\n\nThe client now requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or .NET Standard 2.0.\nEarlier versions are no longer supported by the `6.x` series.\n\nKey improvements in this release have been the result of hard work by\nour stellar community members (in no particular order): @stebet, @bording,\n@Anarh2404, @danielmarbach, and others.\n\nA full list of changes can be found in the GitHub milestone: [`6.0.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/41?closed=1).\n\n### The Switch to System.Memory (and [Significantly Lower Memory Footprint](https://stebet.net/real-world-example-of-reducing-allocations-using-span-t-and-memory-t/) that Comes with It)\n\nThe client now uses the [`System.Memory` library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Memory/) for message and command payloads. This significantly\nreduces object allocation and GC pressure for heavy workloads but also\n**potentially requires application changes**: consumer delivery payloads are now of instance [`System.ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.readonlymemory-1?view=netcore-3.1)\ninstead of `byte[]`.\n\nWhile there's an implicit conversion for these types,\ninstances of `System.ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` **must be copied or consumed/deserialised before delivery handler completes**.\nHolding on to delivered payloads and referencing them at a later point **is no longer safe**.\n\nThe same applies to publishers and the `IModel.BasicPublish` method: prefer using `System.ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`\nover `byte[]` and dont' assume that this memory can be retained and used outside of the scope of the publishing\nfunction.\n\nGitHub issue: [#732](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/732)\n\n### Timeouts Use `System.TimeSpan`\n\nAll timeout arguments now use `System.TimeSpan` values.\n\nGitHub issue: [#688](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/688)\n\n### Reduced Public API Surface\n\nNo major changes here but this is potentially breaking. Only public classes that were never meant\nto be publicly used have been turned internal to the client.\n\nGitHub issue: [#714](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/714)\n\n### Requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or .NET Standard 2.0\n\nThe client now requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or .NET Standard 2.0. Earlier versions are no longer\nsupported.\n\nGitHub issue: [#686](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/686)\n\n### `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource` Dependency Dropped\n\n`Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource` dependency has been removed. It was an annoying\ndependency to have for some environments.\n\n### Source Linking\n\nThe library now supports source linking.\n\nGitHub issue: [#697](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/697)\n\n### NuGet Source Packages\n\nSource packages are now also distributed via NuGet.\n\n### CRL Checks for Server x.509 (TLS) Certificates\n\nAdded a TLS option to enforce CRL checks for server certificates.\n\nGitHub issue: [#500](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/500)\n\n\n\n## Changes Between 5.1.2

          "content": "Thank you for using RabbitMQ and for taking the time to contribute to the project.\nThis document has two main parts:\n\n * when and how to file GitHub issues for RabbitMQ projects\n * how to submit pull requests\n\nThey intend to save you and RabbitMQ maintainers some time, so please\ntake a moment to read through them.\n\n## Overview\n\n### GitHub issues\n\nThe RabbitMQ team uses GitHub issues for _specific actionable items_ that\nengineers can work on. This assumes the following:\n\n* GitHub issues are not used for questions, investigations, root cause\n  analysis, discussions of potential issues, etc (as defined by this team)\n* Enough information is provided by the reporter for maintainers to work with\n\nThe team receives many questions through various venues every single\nday. Frequently, these questions do not include the necessary details\nthe team needs to begin useful work. GitHub issues can very quickly\nturn into a something impossible to navigate and make sense\nof. Because of this, questions, investigations, root cause analysis,\nand discussions of potential features are all considered to be\n[mailing list][rmq-users] material. If you are unsure where to begin,\nthe [RabbitMQ users mailing list][rmq-users] is the right place.\n\nGetting all the details necessary to reproduce an issue, make a\nconclusion or even form a hypothesis about what's happening can take a\nfair amount of time. Please help others help you by providing a way to\nreproduce the behavior you're observing, or at least sharing as much\nrelevant information as possible on the [RabbitMQ users mailing\nlist][rmq-users].\n\nPlease provide versions of the software used:\n\n * RabbitMQ server\n * Erlang\n * Operating system version (and distribution, if applicable)\n * All client libraries used\n * RabbitMQ plugins (if applicable)\n\nThe following information greatly helps in investigating and reproducing issues:\n\n * RabbitMQ server logs\n * A code example or terminal transcript that can be used to reproduce\n * Full exception stack traces (a single line message is not enough!)\n * `rabbitmqctl report` and `rabbitmqctl environment` output\n * Other relevant details about the environment and workload, e.g. a traffic capture\n * Feel free to edit out hostnames and other potentially sensitive information.\n\nTo make collecting much of this and other environment information, use\nthe [`rabbitmq-collect-env`][rmq-collect-env] script. It will produce an archive with\nserver logs, operating system logs, output of certain diagnostics commands and so on.\nPlease note that **no effort is made to scrub any information that may be sensitive**.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nRabbitMQ projects use pull requests to discuss, collaborate on and accept code contributions.\nPull requests is the primary place of discussing code changes.\n\nHere's the recommended workflow:\n\n * [Fork the repository][github-fork] or repositories you plan on contributing to. If multiple\n   repositories are involved in addressing the same issue, please use the same branch name\n   in each repository\n * Create a branch with a descriptive name in the relevant repositories\n * Make your changes, [run tests](RUNNING_TESTS.md), commit with a\n   [descriptive message][git-commit-msgs], push to your fork\n * Submit pull requests with an explanation what has been changed and **why**\n * Submit a filled out and signed [Contributor Agreement][ca-agreement] if needed (see below)\n * Be patient. We will get to your pull request eventually\n\nIf what you are going to work on is a substantial change, please first\nask the core team for their opinion on the [RabbitMQ users mailing list][rmq-users].\n\n### Building Source\n\nIt is good practice to make sure you can build the project before making any\nchanges to confirm that your development environment is set up correctly.\nVerifying that the tests pass is also a good practice (see\n[RUNNING_TESTS.md](/RUNNING_TESTS.md)).\n\nAll together, this looks like:\n\n* Linux\n\n```shell\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client\ncd rabbitmq-dotnet-client\n\n# On any Linux distribution with Docker installed\n./.ci/ubuntu/gha-setup.sh toxiproxy pull\n\nmake build\nmake test\n```\n\n* Windows\n\nNote that this will _NOT_ run toxiproxy tests.\n\n```powershell\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client\ncd rabbitmq-dotnet-client\n.\\.ci\\windows\\gha-setup.ps1 # On Windows. Note that this installs RabbitMQ\n.\\build.ps1 -RunTests:$true\n```\n\n### Running Tests\n\nSee [RUNNING_TESTS.md](/RUNNING_TESTS.md).\n\n### Running Benchmarks\n\nBenchmarks can be found under `./projects/Benchmarks`. On the command line, run them with `dotnet run`\nlike so:\n\n```\ndotnet run --configuration Release --project ./projects/Benchmarks/ --filter Networking_BasicDeliver_LongLivedConnection\n```\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nSee [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Contributor Agreement\n\nIf you want to contribute a non-trivial change, please submit a signed\ncopy of our [Contributor Agreement][ca-agreement] around the time you\nsubmit your pull request. This will make it much easier (in some\ncases, possible) for the RabbitMQ team at Pivotal to merge your\ncontribution.\n\n## Where to Ask Questions\n\nIf something isn't clear, feel free to ask on our [mailing list][rmq-users].\n\n[rmq-collect-env]: https://github.com/rabbitmq/support-tools/blob/master/scripts/rabbitmq-collect-env\n[git-commit-msgs]: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\n[rmq-users]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users\n[ca-agreement]: https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/rabbitmq\n[github-fork]: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\n"

The default\nvalues are:\n\n* RabbitMQ .NET client 7.0.0 and beyond: 128MiB\n* RabbitMQ .NET client 6.4.0 up to 7.0.0: no limit by default\n\nReceiving a frame that specifies a content larger than the limit will throw an execption. This is to\nhelp prevent situations as described in [this discussion](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/discussions/1213).\n\nTo set a limit, use the set `MaxMessageSize` on your `ConnectionFactory` before opening connections:\n\n```\n// This sets the limit to 512MiB\nvar cf = new ConnectionFactory();\ncf.MaxMessageSize = 536870912;\nvar conn = cf.CreateConnection()`\n```\n\nGitHub milestone: [`6.4.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/58?closed=1)\nDiff: [link](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/compare/v6.3.1...v6.4.0)\n\n## Changes Between 6.3.0 and 6.3.1\n\nGitHub milestone: [`6.3.1`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/57?closed=1)\nDiff: [link](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/compare/v6.3.0...v6.3.1)\n\n## Changes Between 6.2.4 and 6.3.0\n\nGitHub milestone: [`6.3.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/52?closed=1)\nDiff: [link](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/compare/v6.2.4...v6.3.0)\n\n## Changes Between 6.2.3 and 6.2.4\n\nGitHub milestone: [`6.2.4`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/55?closed=1)\n\nThis release contains some important bug fixes:\n\n* [Fix connection leaks on auto recovery](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/1145)\n* [Fix buffer overflow when writing long strings](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/1162)\n* [Fix regression resulting in `ObjectDisposedException`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/1154)\n* [Fix regression that could affect consuming after auto recovery](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/1148)\n\n## Changes Between 6.2.1 and 6.2.3\n\nGitHub milestone: [`6.2.3`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/54?closed=1)\nGitHub milestone: [`6.2.2`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/51?closed=1)\n\n## Changes Between 6.2.0 and 6.2.1\n\n6.2.0 was published incorrectly, resulting in version 6.2.1\n\nGitHub milestone: [`6.2.1`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/50?closed=1).\n\n## Changes Between 6.1.0 and 6.2.0\n\nA full list of changes can be found in the GitHub milestone: [`6.2.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/49?closed=1).\n\n## Changes Between 6.0.0 and 6.1.0\n\nThis release continues with improvements to memory use and object allocations.\n\nA full list of changes can be found in the GitHub milestone: [`6.1.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/48?closed=1).\n\n## Changes Between 5.2.0 and 6.0.0\n\nThis major release of this client introduces substantial improvements\nin terms of memory footprint and throughput. They come at the cost\nof minor but important **breaking API changes** covered below.\n\nThe client now requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or .NET Standard 2.0.\nEarlier versions are no longer supported by the `6.x` series.\n\nKey improvements in this release have been the result of hard work by\nour stellar community members (in no particular order): @stebet, @bording,\n@Anarh2404, @danielmarbach, and others.\n\nA full list of changes can be found in the GitHub milestone: [`6.0.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/41?closed=1).\n\n### The Switch to System.Memory (and [Significantly Lower Memory Footprint](https://stebet.net/real-world-example-of-reducing-allocations-using-span-t-and-memory-t/) that Comes with It)\n\nThe client now uses the [`System.Memory` library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Memory/) for message and command payloads. This significantly\nreduces object allocation and GC pressure for heavy workloads but also\n**potentially requires application changes**: consumer delivery payloads are now of instance [`System.ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.readonlymemory-1?view=netcore-3.1)\ninstead of `byte[]`.\n\nWhile there's an implicit conversion for these types,\ninstances of `System.ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` **must be copied or consumed/deserialised before delivery handler completes**.\nHolding on to delivered payloads and referencing them at a later point **is no longer safe**.\n\nThe same applies to publishers and the `IModel.BasicPublish` method: prefer using `System.ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`\nover `byte[]` and dont' assume that this memory can be retained and used outside of the scope of the publishing\nfunction.\n\nGitHub issue: [#732](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/732)\n\n### Timeouts Use `System.TimeSpan`\n\nAll timeout arguments now use `System.TimeSpan` values.\n\nGitHub issue: [#688](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/688)\n\n### Reduced Public API Surface\n\nNo major changes here but this is potentially breaking. Only public classes that were never meant\nto be publicly used have been turned internal to the client.\n\nGitHub issue: [#714](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/714)\n\n### Requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or .NET Standard 2.0\n\nThe client now requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or .NET Standard 2.0. Earlier versions are no longer\nsupported.\n\nGitHub issue: [#686](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/686)\n\n### `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource` Dependency Dropped\n\n`Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource` dependency has been removed. It was an annoying\ndependency to have for some environments.\n\n### Source Linking\n\nThe library now supports source linking.\n\nGitHub issue: [#697](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/697)\n\n### NuGet Source Packages\n\nSource packages are now also distributed via NuGet.\n\n### CRL Checks for Server x.509 (TLS) Certificates\n\nAdded a TLS option to enforce CRL checks for server certificates.\n\nGitHub issue: [#500](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/500)\n\n\n\n## Changes Between 5.1.2

Limitations on Grant Scope\n\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\nthis License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4.

Representation\n\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6.

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5.

However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License.

Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward.

          "content": "# Overview\n\nThe RabbitMQ .NET client's test suite assumes there's a RabbitMQ node listening\non `localhost:5672` (the default settings). TLS tests require a node listening\non the default [TLS port](https://rabbitmq.com/ssl.html).\n\nIt is possible to use Visual Studio Community Edition and `dotnet.exe` in\n`PATH`, to build the client and run the test suite.\n\n\n## Building\n\n\n### Windows\n\n```powershell\nbuild.ps1\n```\n\n### MacOS and Linux\n\n```shell\ndotnet build ./Build.csproj\n```\n\nThis will build all projects. After this open the solution in Visual Studio.\n\n\n## Test Environment Requirements\n\nTests can be run from Visual Studio using the XUnit Test Adapter.  Note that it\nmay take some time for the adapter to discover tests in the assemblies.\n\nThe test suite assumes there's a RabbitMQ node running locally with all\ndefaults, incl. the management plugin, and the tests will need to be able to run commands against the\n[`rabbitmqctl`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmqctl.8.html) tool for that node.\nTwo options to accomplish this are covered below.\n\n\n### Option One: Using a RabbitMQ Release\n\nIt is possible to install and run a node using any [binary build](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)\nsuitable for the platform. Its [CLI tools](https://rabbitmq.com/cli.html) then must be added to `PATH` so that `rabbitmqctl` can be\ninvoked directly without using an absolute file path. Note that this method does *not* work on Windows.\n\nOn Windows, you must run unit tests as follows (replace `X.Y.Z` with your RabbitMQ version):\n\n```powershell\n$env:RABBITMQ_RABBITMQCTL_PATH='C:\\Program Files\\RabbitMQ Server\\rabbitmq_server-X.Y.Z\\sbin\\rabbitmqctl.bat'\n.\\build.ps1 -RunTests\n```\n\n### Option Two: Building a RabbitMQ Node from Source\n\nT run a RabbitMQ node [built from source](https://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html):\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server.git rabbitmq-server\ncd rabbitmq-server\n\n# assumes Make is available\nmake co\ncd deps/rabbit\nmake\nmake run-broker\n```\n\n`rabbitmqctl` location will be computed using a relative path under the source repository,\nin this example, it should be `./rabbitmq-server/deps/rabbit/sbin/rabbitmqctl`.\n\nIt is possible to override the location using `RABBITMQ_RABBITMQCTL_PATH`:\n\n```\nRABBITMQ_RABBITMQCTL_PATH=/path/to/rabbitmqctl dotnet test projects/Test/Unit.csproj\n```\n\n### Option Three: Using a Docker Container\n\nIt is also possible to run a RabbitMQ node in a\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.  Set the environment variable\n`RABBITMQ_RABBITMQCTL_PATH` to `DOCKER:<container_name>` (for example\n`DOCKER:rabbitmq-dotnet-client-rabbitmq`). This tells the unit tests to run the `rabbitmqctl`\ncommands through Docker, in the format `docker exec rabbitmq01 rabbitmqctl\n<args>`:\n\n```shell\ndocker run -d --hostname rabbitmq01 --name rabbitmq01 -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management\n```\n\nYou should also be able to run the same script that sets up the Ubuntu 22 GitHub actions worker:\n\n```shell\n./.ci/ubuntu/gha-setup.sh\n```\n\n## Running All Tests\n\nThen, to run the tests use:\n\n\n### Windows\n\nNote that the `-RunTests` does not run the OAuth2 test suite.\n\n```powershell\nbuild.ps1 -RunTests\n```\n\n### MacOS, Linux, BSD:\n\nNote that the `test` target does not run the OAuth2 test suite.\n\n```shell\nmake test\n```\n\n## Running Individual Suites or Test Cases\n\nRunning individual tests and fixtures on Windows is trivial using the Visual Studio test runner.\nTo run a specific tests fixture on MacOS or Linux, use the NUnit filter expressions to select the tests to be run:\n\n``` shell\ndotnet test projects/Test/Unit.csproj --filter \"Name~TestAmqpUriParseFail\"\n\ndotnet test projects/Test/Unit.csproj --filter \"FullyQualifiedName~RabbitMQ.Client.Unit.TestHeartbeats\"\n```\n\n## Running Tests for a Specific .NET Target\n\nTo run tests targeting .NET 8.0:\n\n``` shell\ndotnet test --framework net8.0 projects/Unit\n```\n"

In addition to this document, please refer to the comprehensive\nintegration test suites\n[here](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/tree/main/projects/Test/Integration)\nand\n[here](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/tree/main/projects/Test/SequentialIntegration)\nthat demonstrate these changes.\n\nIf you have questions about version 7 of this library, please start a new discussion here:\n\nhttps://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/discussions\n\n## `async` / `await`\n\nThe entire public API and internals of this library have been modified to use\nthe [`Task` asynchronous programming model\n(TAP)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/).\nAll TAP methods end with an `Async` suffix, and can be `await`-ed.\n\n## Connections and channels\n\n* `IModel` has been renamed to `IChannel`\n\n## Publishing messages\n\nJust create a new instance of the `BasicProperties` class when publishing\nmessages. The `CreateBasicProperties` method on the old `IModel` interface has\nbeen removed.\n\n## Consuming messages\n\nWhen a message is delivered to your code via the\n`AsyncEventingBasicConsumer.Received` event or by sub-classing\n`DefaultAsyncConsumer`, please note that the `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` that\nrepresents the message body is owned by this library, and that memory is only\nvalid for application use within the context of the executing `Received` event\nor `HandleBasicDeliver` method.\n\nIf you wish to use this data _outside_ of these methods, you **MUST** copy the\ndata for your use:\n\n```\nbyte[] myMessageBody = eventArgs.Body.ToArray();\n```\n"
