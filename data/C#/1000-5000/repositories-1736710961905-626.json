Myrtille requires a Windows Server edition (2012 R2 or greater) for itself (remote servers can be whatever OS with RDP enabled). Windows client editions (7, 8, 10 - whatever the version: pro, enterprise, ultimate, etc.) are not suitable for Myrtille due to the limitation to a maximum of 10 simultaneous connections on IIS!\r\n\ta client is now identified by an unique id instead of a cookie based key; this fixes a problem of sharing a session by url within the same browser\r\n\tdisabled the share session by url feature (web.config), because it bypasses the share session by guest logic and make it difficult to track the active clients\r\n\tredesigned the adaptive display tweaking logic, based on bandwidth usage\r\n\r\n2021-03-07 Version 2.9.2\r\n\tFreeRDP is now built as a dll instead of an executable for better modularity and to reduce the risk of false positive detection of wfreerdp.exe by some antiviruses (mostly cloud based)\r\n\tembedded interact.js and simple-keyboard (nodejs modules) into myrtille in order to remove dependencies on external CDNs (ans thus allow myrtille to be used standalone and not subject to external changes)\r\n\tfixed a problem with the creation of the self-signed certificate that prevented Myrtille from installing correctly on Windows Server 2012 R2 (thanks camjcorley)\r\n\ta session can now be shared directly by url (simply copy & paste the page url then share it), with owner rights (web.config, can be disabled for anti-spoofing protection)\r\n\tregion updates are now dropped by the gateway if the client latency is above the image cache duration (1 sec); only fullscreen updates are sent\r\n\tdisplay updates can now be distributed across concurrent websockets (round robin load balancing) to reduce lag in case of network issues (config.js, default 5 websockets: 1 up 4 down). CAUTION! IIS on Windows client OSes (7, 8, 10) is limited to 10 simultaneous connections only - across all http sessions - and will hang after that! use Windows Server editions for production environments\r\n\tthe mouse move sampling rate is now decreased automatically in case of low bandwidth (default 100%, config.js)\r\n\trefactoring\r\n\r\n2021-01-08 Version 2.9.1 (stable)\r\n\tfixed an issue where the installer hangs due to enabling Windows features (via PowerShell) that prompt the user to restart or not while there is no UI to confirm\r\n\tfixed a regression when hiding the toolbar from web.config\r\n\tfixed an issue into FreeRDP with a special copy&paste logic into MS Office applications which disconnected the session after a special paste when pressing the enter key\r\n\tthe protocol scheme when sharing a session or creating a session URL is now determined by the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO http header if available, instead of the current http request, so that https is correctly detected after a redirection by a reverse proxy or a load-balancer\r\n\tnow rolling over display updates and audio block indexes if they reach max int value\r\n\tfixed a minor regression which prevented myrtille to work on old IE browsers\r\n\r\n2020-09-26 Version 2.9.0 (stable)\r\n\tadded a virtual on-screen keyboard (multi-languages)\r\n\tpopups are now draggable\r\n\tshowing the toolbar no longer shifts the display down\r\n\tthe rendering quality can now tweaked from the toolbar (lower quality = lower bandwidth usage), in addition to the default value defined in config.js\r\n\tdisplay updates are now consolidated instead of dropped when the available bandwidth gets low (config.js)\r\n\twebsocket can now be configured to handle both user inputs and display updates on the same instance (duplex, default) or use separate instances (dual) [experimental]\r\n\tadded support of event source (SSE) as an alternative to long-polling (requires HTML5 and not compatible with old IE/Edge browsers) [experimental]\r\n\tit's now possible to switch automatically from websocket to event source when the latency gets high (the websocket protocol may be filtered or throttled by some network proxies) (config.js) [experimental]\r\n\tdisabled the warning messages when the latency gets high (config.js) or in case of xhr timeout (xmlhttp.js)\r\n\tlatency is now updated on a 1 sec timer, even if the user does nothing\r\n\tfixed random freezes while requesting fullscreen updates\r\n\tthe disconnect command is now given priority in xhr mode\r\n\tlong-polling is now an http handler\r\n\tmessages are serialized in JSON instead of raw text\r\n\tfixed an issue with messages containing the \";\" character\r\n\tfixed an issue with file transfer when using a domain (thanks camjcorley)\r\n\tfixed an issue with file transfer and user profiles containing unicode characters\r\n\tfixed an issue with the tab key in SSH mode (this also fixes shell autocompletion)\r\n\tfixed an issue with the change password popup (enterprise mode / local admin), which wasn't displayed correctly\r\n\tif no domain is defined into the domain input field, myrtille now tries to retrieve the domain from the username (using the standard UPN syntax: DOMAIN\\username or username@domain.com)\r\n\tupdated the myrtille project url\r\n\trefactoring\r\n\r\n2020-04-20 Version 2.8.1 (stable)\r\n\tchanged the default display resize mode from scale to none (config.js); this eliminates a loss of display sharpness when the aspect ratio is not preserved; reconnect is not supported by Windows Server 2019 (see documentation)\r\n\tif using scale on resize, the aspect ratio is now preserved by default (config.js)\r\n\tlowered bandwidth usage: the default display quality is now JPEG 75% (lossy) instead of PNG (lossless) (config.js); this significantly reduces the size of display updates when using graphics applications and JPEG is generated faster\r\n\tlowered bandwidth usage: the adaptive fullscreen update is now disabled (config.js); it's not needed most of the time (unless if the display quality is poor); it's role is to restore the display sharpness and fix potential display issues when the user becomes inactive\r\n\tlowered bandwidth usage: the default audio compression is now MP3 128 kbps instead of WAV 1411 kbps (config.js)\r\n\r\n2020-01-26 Version 2.8.0 (stable)\r\n\tpre-requisites change; myrtille now requires Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 or greater\r\n\tthe installer is now shipped without bootstraper (Setup.exe); open the myrtille msi file directly instead\r\n\tthe installer now installs the myrtille pre-requisites automatically (roles and features); the related powershell scripts can also be run manually from outside the installer, if needed\r\n\tthe installer now supports upgrading (thanks to Orca, which allows finer control over msi files), removing the need to uninstall a previous version first\r\n\tmyrtille is now available as a docker image (see DOCUMENTATION.MD)\r\n\tresynced FreeRDP (among many things, fixes some issues related to the clipboard and audio)\r\n\tfixed session disconnect occuring under some circumstances on clipboard paste\r\n\tfixed an issue where only the first letter of the clipboard content was displayed on clipboard paste\r\n\tsimplified hosts management (no domain or enterprise mode required); default login: admin/admin (changed upon first login)\r\n\tupdated the enterprise mode so that a member of \"EnterpriseAdminGroup\" can connect an host whatever the allowed groups or users defined on it (thanks dgcom)\r\n\tfixed an issue with the enterprise mode, which prompted to change the password due to expiration whereas the expiration date was just not set (thanks dgcom)\r\n\tsecurity protocol is now configurable for RDP over VM bus\r\n\tuser domain is now configurable whatever the protocol and displayed into the toolbar, if defined\r\n\tupdated comments to drain disconnected sessions when using a connection broker in HA mode (myrtille services config)\r\n\tstarting with Windows Server 2019 (or Windows 10 release 1903), RDS introduces changes with NLA and the way disconnected sessions are handled (see DOCUMENTATION.MD); myrtille now default to scale instead of reconnect\r\n\tif scaling the display on browser resize, you can choose whether to preserve or not the aspect ratio (config.js, default = don't keep)\r\n\tvarious minor fixes\r\n\r\n2019-11-27 Version 2.7.1 (stable)\r\n\t* HOTFIX * fixed a potential crash of myrtille services when sending a disconnect notification (https://github.com/cedrozor/myrtille/issues/187, thanks gtmsew)\r\n\tthe automatic application pool recycling is now disabled by default, and is not applicable if using the enterprise mode (this prevents enterprise sessions to be dropped unexpectedly!)\r\n\tif recycling is enabled, a new http session is now acquired on disconnect; this prevents a subsequent login failure (due to the old http session being invalid) without any error message\r\n\r\n2019-11-19 Version 2.7.0 (stable)\r\n\t* HOTFIX * fixed a critical issue with FreeRDP (exit code 131085) when using an RD license server configured in \"per device\" mode, past the 120 days of the RDS grace period\r\n\tupdated readme and documentation about the RDS role\r\n\tthe browser \"heartbeat\" (used to detect if the browser window/tab was closed) is now on a different timer than the periodical fullscreen update (config.js; default 10 secs)\r\n\tdisabled the alt key capture because it may interfere with the browser alt+key menu\r\n\tkeys following the alt+gr modifier are now sent as scancode instead of unicode\r\n\tability to configure the login url (by default the myrtille login page; web.config)\r\n\tupdated the installer for a better display of prerequisites\r\n\tadded the option into the installer to choose either to pass the http session ID into url or store it into the default \"ASP.NET_SessionId\" cookie (the former allows multiple connections/tabs or iframes)\r\n\tthe connection API is now out of beta and installed by default (full auto-connect/start program from url syntax is still available)\r\n\tthe scale feature now keeps the aspect ratio on browser resize\r\n\tfixed a display refresh issue under chrome + https if the clipboard is empty\r\n\tincreased the image cache duration (1 sec -> 3 secs)\r\n\thalved the input buffer duration (based on the roundtrip duration)\r\n\tupdated display tweaking\r\n\timproved cleanup on session disconnect into wfreerdp to prevent memory leaks with GDI+\r\n\timproved cleanup on session disconnect into Myrtille to prevent memory leaks on the application pool\r\n\tremoved any unnecessary memory allocation and released any disposable object on the application pool\r\n\tthe application pool is now automatically recycled when there is no active remote session (configurable into web.config)\r\n\tfixed an issue related to the disconnect callback (which was sometimes not received by the gateway due a WCF deadlock)\r\n\tscripts and styles now have computed hashes to prevent browser caching (in case content is changed); they could also be minified, as needed (see comments in BundleConfig.cs)\r\n\tre-enabled multiple connections/tabs (web.config, read comments about security)\r\n\tthe address of the connected server is now displayed into the window/tab title, if not using a connection API (thanks Zak)\r\n\tfixed invalid mouse cursor update under certain circumstances (thanks joburg)\r\n\tfixed potential delayed wfreerdp exit in case of session disconnect\r\n\r\n2019-09-02 Version 2.6.0 (stable)\r\n\tresynced FreeRDP (2.0.0-dev5)\r\n\tadded a REST API to disconnect a given remote session or all of them (on a gateway)\r\n\tfixed an issue with some network or domain configuration that could delay the start of a connection\r\n\tsupport of Connection Broker database, in High Availability mode\r\n\tsupport of RDS API\r\n\tconfigurable drain of disconnected sessions\r\n\tseamless clipboard synchronization, using the async clipboard API (requires Chrome and HTTPS) with fallback to standard web API (for other browsers and HTTP)\r\n\tnow hiding iframe content on browser resize\r\n\tvarious mockup improvements\r\n\tget focus back on main window after a popup is closed\r\n\tscreenshot is now returned as HttpResponseMessage, byte array content\r\n\tclipboard virtual channel comments and check\r\n\tthe self-signed certificate (installed by myrtille on install) is now issued with the machine FQDN to prevent ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID (Subject Alternative Name Missing) in recent Chrome releases\r\n\tnow using a web worker for the periodical fullscreen updates to keep them going even if the main thread is paused (due to inactive window/tab, after focus lost for example)\r\n\tsome refactoring\r\n\r\n2019-06-01 Version 2.5.5 (stable)\r\n\tadded audio support (MP3 (default)/WAV, config.js)\r\n\t(beta) added a REST API to prevent the connection details to be passed into the querystring; a connection identifier (&cid=) is passed instead and the connection details are retrieved by the myrtille gateway using the REST API\r\n\t(beta) added a REST API to share a remote session and manage the active guest(s)\r\n\t(beta) added a REST API to take screenshots of the remote session (either automatically (periodically), or manually)\r\n\tadded the ability to hide the toolbar (web.config, you can hide it if using your own UI)\r\n\tadded the ability to disable connection from login screen or url (web.config, you can disable it if using a connection API)\r\n\tfixed a regression into the buffer processing\r\n\tfixed a mouse left button bug which happened sometimes in HTML4\r\n\tfixed a display glitch with too many divs displayed at once in HTML4\r\n\tfixed a keyboard handling issue with Ubuntu in RDP over VM bus (Hyper-V) mode\r\n\tfixed some issues related to session sharing\r\n\timproved the ability to run myrtille into an iframe (like for multiple connections/tabs, requires \"cookieless=useURI\" mode into web.config): multiple iframes on a same page, key combination to switch from one iframe to another (shift + alt), focus management, etc.; cross domain restriction can be avoided by having all iframes on the same domain as the main page\r\n\timproved the scale and reconnect features on browser resize; they can now be toggled from the toolbar (instead of using a web.config key)\r\n\ttoolbar state is now saved into a cookie to persist across page reload(s)\r\n\tstat, debug and compatibility modes are now handled client side, saved into a cookie and always available; they are no longer bound to the remote session (so that, if the remote session is shared, guest(s) can now use them independently from the owner!)\r\n\ta remote session now supports mixed HTML4 and HTML5 client(s)\r\n\tfixed some issues in compatibility (HTML4) mode (long-polling); for example, missing carriage returns and line feeds into SSH terminal and remote clipboard popup\r\n\tremoved the display websocket buffer (as the connection remains open, it was not really necessary nor did it provide satisfactory results)\r\n\r\n2019-02-14 Version 2.3.1 (stable)\r\n\tthe remote session display is now automatically scaled to the browser size on session start\r\n\tNEW! as an alternative to scaling, the remote session can be reconnected on browser resize to preserve the aspect ratio (web.config, disable \"ScaleOnResize\")\r\n\tfixed a race condition in which the browser sent certain configuration parameters before the connection was effective\r\n\timproved the up/down swipe gesture management (should be smoother now)\r\n\tmore FreeRDP params are now configurable (bin/Myrtille.Services.exe.config)\r\n\tdisabled FreeRDP glyph cache to fix display issues on Windows Server 2008 R2 (also fixes issues with chinese characters)\r\n\tfixed unexpected disconnects on Windows Server 2008 R2 (https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues/3595)\r\n\tresynced FreeRDP (2.0.0-RC4)\r\n\r\n2018-11-03 Version 2.3.0 (stable)\r\n\tHOTFIX! increased the WCF channels limits; this fixes an issue where some connections failed under the load\r\n\tadded WCF traces (disabled by default; see comments in configs)\r\n\treplaced the remote session auto-incremented counter (as identifier) by a guid; this ensures an unique identifier even if Myrtille.Services (or MyrtilleAppPool before version 2.2.0) is restarted\r\n\tthe Myrtille.PDF virtual printer now opens the browser print dialog, removing the need to install a PDF viewer on the end user machine and providing direct access to local (or network) printers (not working with the built-in Firefox PDF.js, option to open/download the pdf instead)\r\n\tadded swipe up/down gesture management for touchscreen devices (useful to scroll the display in applications that need it; can be disabled into the toolbar) * experimental feature! * not working on IE/Edge (see below)\r\n\temulating mouse events for IE/Edge on touchscreen devices (touchscreen is disabled by default into IE/Edge and use pointer events instead of touch when enabled into about:flags)\r\n\tfor easier auto-connect / start program from url management, you can generate a password hash from url (thanks jol64). syntax: https://server/myrtille/GetHash.aspx?password=password\r\n\tresynced FreeRDP (2.0.0 RC3)\r\n\r\n2018-10-21 Version 2.2.0 (stable)\r\n\tdisabled the myrtille application pool recycling\r\n\tmoved the remote session counter (auto-increment) to the service layer\r\n\tmyrtille pdf printer is now disabled by default in web.config\r\n\tfixed SSH on non-default port (thanks pk910)\r\n\r\n2018-08-19 Version 2.1.2 (stable)\r\n\tfixed an ipv6 connection issue (that may occurred when checking the link-local ipv6 address)\r\n\r\n2018-08-14 Version 2.1.1 (stable)\r\n\tResynced FreeRDP (2.0.0-dev4)\r\n\tHyper-V VM direct connection is now labelled \"RDP over VM bus\" into the login screen as a distinct host type\r\n\tlogin form inputs are shown/hidden depending of the selected host type\r\n\tadded support of enhanced mode for Hyper-V VM direct connection (faster rendering and remote clipboard/printer are available) (thanks jol64)\r\n\tadded the name of the connected user into the toolbar (in addition to the connected server) when it's possible to retrieve it (standard rdp connection and non interactive logon)\r\n\tupdated documentation\r\n\r\n2018-08-06 Version 2.1.0 (stable)\r\n\tsupport of Hyper-V VM direct connection (extension of the RDP protocol; doesn't require remote desktop access to be enabled on the guest VM) (thanks jol64)\r\n\tupdated documentation for usage and limitations of the Hyper-V connection\r\n\tfixed a potential inversion of arrows and numbers keys (whatever the numlock status)\r\n\tfixed a path issue for the myrtille PDF virtual printer (in debug build or if the printer service runs under a custom account)\r\n\tfixed the files popup which always downloaded the first document, regardless of the selected one (regression from version 1.9.0)\r\n\r\n2018-07-31 Version 2.0.0 (stable)\r\n\tResynced FreeRDP (FQDN hotfix, introduced into myrtille 1.7.0, is still active... wfreerdp need some love :/)\r\n\tthe RDP security protocol (NLA, TLS, RDP, etc.) can now be selected from the login screen (RDP for compatibility and interactive logon, or in case of NLA issue; see https://github.com/cedrozor/myrtille/issues/116)\r\n\tSSH terminal support (thanks Paul)\r\n\tremoved any RDP references on the gateway to make it fully protocol agnostic (support of any remote access protocol)\r\n\tfile transfer and print download can now be disabled from web config (along with remote clipboard and session sharing)\r\n\twhen sharing a remote session, guests now can't interact with it (they are just spectators)\r\n\tincluded prompt for user credentials in enterprise mode\r\n\tfixed login failure when passing domain in enterprise mode if IP is used instead of FQDN\r\n\tfixed some css in enterprise mode (under Firefox)\r\n\twebsockets are now buffered for optimal performance on high latency / low bandwidth networks (thanks SieldP)\r\n\tre-enabled stat button, which could help to diagnose connection issues (shows latency, bandwidth usage, etc.)\r\n\tadded a small icon on top of the screen to toggle the toolbar while connected (thanks windylea)\r\n\timproved error messages in case of connection failure\r\n\tsome refactoring\r\n\r\n﻿2018-06-09 Version 1.9.1 (stable)\r\n\treinstated the hotfix removed into version 1.9.0, forcing IP connection when using FQDN; fact is, some people still have issues even with openssl 1.1.x (unable to reproduce, may depend on a specific configuration). more details here: https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues/4525#issuecomment-380635647\r\n\timproved performance mitigation in case of high latency network\r\n\tthe installer no longer requires administrator rights by default (but may still needs elevation during the installation, depending on the installed component(s))\r\n\r\n2018-05-24 Version 1.9.0 (stable)\r\n\tresynced FreeRDP (version 2.0-RC2-dev3), now using the openssl 1.1.x architecture.

I (Cedric Coste) was in charge of the websites (admin and frontal), business and database layers. The objective was to demonstrate it was possible to virtualize desktops and applications into a web browser only using native web technologies (no plugin). HTML5 was in early stage and it was a real challenge to do it only with HTML4. We were pioneers on that matter, along with Guacamole (HTML5/VNC), and wanted to take part on the emerging SaaS market.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a success because, at that time, the zero plugin concept was innovative and unlike solutions using Java, activeX or Flex; the ease of use and security aspects were also improved. But it was also slow and buggy and was left aside.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, I had the opportunity to create a company, named Steemind, with Catalin Trifanescu (a former coworker). I rewrote everything and used FreeRDP as rdp client (AppliKr was using RDesktop) and speed and stability were way better. The company failed in 2012 because we weren't able to achieve a decent fund raising and our customers were moving to Citrix and other major corporate companies in the VDI business.\r\n\r\nI had recently some spare time and, while I was taking my breakfast with some blueberry jam, I decided to extract and improve the Steemind core technology and open source it.\r\n\t\r\nI hope you will enjoy Myrtille! :)\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Catalin Trifanescu for its support.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nWindows Server OS (2012 R2 or greater, with IIS 8.0+, .NET 4.5+ and WCF/HTTP activation enabled). CAUTION! IIS on Windows client OSes (7, 8, 10 - all versions) is limited to 10 simultaneous connections only - across all http sessions - and will hang after that!\r\n\r\nThe .NET 4.5+ framework can be installed automatically by the myrtille installer, enabled as a feature of IIS (Web Server role > Applications Development > ASP.NET 4.5 on Windows Server 2012) or installed separately (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653).\r\n\r\nInto the roles and features management, ensure you have enabled **HTTP Activation** under \".NET Framework 4.5+ Features\" > \"WCF Services\" (required by the Myrtille services and REST API).\r\n\r\nThe installer does install myrtille under the IIS default website and creates a custom application pool (\"MyrtilleAppPool\"). If you want to use another website or application pool, you can change it manually afterward (with the IIS manager).\r\n\r\nAll releases here: https://github.com/cedrozor/myrtille/releases\r\n\r\n## Docker\r\nFrom version 2.8.0, Myrtille is available as a docker image.\r\n\r\nNo installation is required, you just need Docker Desktop or Toolbox for Windows (Windows 10 Pro or Windows Server 2016 or greater) with Windows containers enabled and Hyper-V isolation.\r\n\r\nMyrtille is fully functional as a container, but there are also some limitations (inherent to Windows containers): print and audio redirection (through RDP) is not supported at the moment (this may change into a future version).\r\n\r\nYou can pull it from Docker Hub with the following command (use a tag for a specific version, or latest otherwise)<br/>\r\n```\r\ndocker pull cedrozor/myrtille(:tag)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo list the network adapters available to Docker<br/>\r\n```\r\ndocker network ls\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the image in detached mode (optionally provide the resulting container a network adapter able to connect your hosts)<br/>\r\n```\r\ndocker run -d (--network=\"<network adapter>\") cedrozor/myrtille(:tag)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo list the containers<br/>\r\n```\r\ndocker ps -a\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo open a shell into a container (and be able to explore it, check its **ip address**, logs, etc.)<br/>\r\n```\r\ndocker exec -it <container ID> cmd\r\ndocker exec -it <container ID> powershell\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo stop a container<br/>\r\n```\r\ndocker stop <container ID>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you intend to have custom settings, manage your hosts or keep track of the logs, you will need to perform additional steps (**data persistence**).\r\n\r\nMore details into **Dockerfile**.\r\n\r\n## Remote Desktop Services\r\n\r\n**For best experience**, and be able to go over the default limit of 2 concurrent users, you will need to install the [RDS role](https://www.exitthefastlane.com/2016/05/native-rds-in-server2016-part-1-basics.html) on your remote server(s). Optionally, you can install the [RD Connection Broker](https://www.tech-coffee.net/rds-2016-farm-deploy-the-farm-in-azure/) feature to allow load-balancing across an RDS farm (possibly hosted on Azure) and manage the applications allowed to run (and with which parameters) on session start.\r\n\r\nYou will also need to enable [multiple sessions per user](https://portal.databasemart.com/kb/a220/how-to-enable-multiple-single-remote-desktop-sessions-in-windows-server-2012.aspx) if you don't want your users to be limited to 1 session only (if you have several users sharing the same account, they will otherwise disconnect each others).\r\n\r\nThe RDS role offers you a **grace period of 120 days** after which you will need to use an [RD License Server](https://www.exitthefastlane.com/2016/06/native-rds-in-server2016-part-3-rdsh.html) with proper licenses (CALs) to suit your licensing mode (\"Per Device\" or \"Per User\").\r\n\r\n**PLEASE READ!** starting with Windows Server 2019 (or Windows 10 release 1903), RDS doesn't reconnect a previously disconnected session (due to a network issue or a manual disconnect) when multiple sessions per user is enabled on the RDS host; instead, it creates a new session. A workaround to that behavior is to lock the session before disconnecting the session (see https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/06/06/microsoft-dismisses-new-windows-rdp-bug-as-a-feature/ and https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/baa5cb75-2fed-4d90-bbc6-404eab4aa20d/2019-rdsh-not-able-reconnect-to-disconnected-session-every-time-new-session-with?forum=winserverTS).\r\n\r\nConsequently, starting from version 2.8.0, Myrtille scales the session display instead of reconnecting the session (with the new browser size), when the browser is resized. To change that default setting, edit (myrtille path)\\js\\config.js (\"display\" section). In addition, you can choose whether or not to keep the aspect ratio of the display (default = don't keep).\r\n\r\n## Auto-connect / Start remote application from URL\r\nStarting from version 1.3.0, it's possible to connect and run a program automatically, on session start, from an URL. It's a feature comparable to remoteApp (.rdp files).\r\n\r\nFrom version 1.5.0, Myrtille does support hashed passwords (so that the password is not plain text into the url). The objective is to have distributable urls to third parties without compromising on security (by giving real passwords); connections are then only possible through myrtille (because direct connections would require the real passwords) and access control could be added into IIS.\r\n\r\nThe start remote application from url feature only works on Windows Servers editions (starting from Server 2012) and only if the program is allowed to run (remoteApp policy). See notes and limitations.\r\n\r\nOn Windows Home Editions, there are several workarounds to start an application automatically on start. You can for example set a Group Policy or define a startup program in registry (HKey_Current_User\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run).\r\n\r\n### Syntax\r\nhttps://myserver/Myrtille/?__EVENTTARGET=&__EVENTARGUMENT=&server=server&domain=domain[optional]&user=user&passwordHash=passwordHash&program=program[optional]&width=width(px)[optional]&height=height(px)[optional]&connect=Connect%21\r\n\r\nDon't set the **\"&program=\"** parameter (or leave it empty) for a direct access to the desktop or set the executable path, name and parameters otherwise (double quotes must be escaped).\r\n\r\nThe pre version 1.5.0 syntax (\"&password=*password*\") is still supported, but it's advisable to move to the safer syntax.\r\n\r\nThe parameters values **must be URL encoded**. You can use a tool like http://www.url-encode-decode.com/ (just copy & paste the encoded parameters into the URL).\r\n\r\nIf you want to connect an Hyper-V VM automatically, add the **\"&vmGuid=\"** parameter (and remove \"&domain=\" and \"&program=\"). For enhanced mode, also add **\"&vmEnhancedMode=checked\"**.\r\n\r\nFor SSH auto-connection, add **\"&hostType=1\"** (and remove \"&domain=\" and \"&program=\").\r\n\r\n### Password Hash\r\nTo generate a password hash, you can use the powershell script \"password51.ps1\" on the myrtille gateway (requires access to the machine). The script is located into the myrtille bin folder at runtime or into the \"Myrtille.Services\" project under Visual Studio.\r\n- Run the script (from its location folder): \". .\\password51.ps1\" (if needed, see powershell script execution policy: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176961.aspx)\r\n- Call the encrypt function: \"Encrypt-RDP-Password -Password *password*\"\r\n- Copy & Paste the result into your URL\r\n\r\nFrom version 2.3.0, you can also generate a password hash from url (thanks jol64). syntax: https://server/myrtille/GetHash.aspx?password=password\r\n\r\nThe password hash is only valid on the machine which generated it (the myrtille gateway); it won't work on another machine. Its length is 492 chars.\r\n\r\nFor further information, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-use-data-protection\r\n\r\n## File transfer\r\nMyrtille supports both local and network file storage. If you want your domain users to have access to their documents whatever the connected server, follow these steps:\r\n- Ensure the machine on which Myrtille is installed is part of the domain\r\n- Create a network share, read/write accessible to the domain users (i.e: \\\\\\MYNETWORKSHARE\\Users)\r\n- Create a Group Policy (GPO), or edit the default one, on your domain server with a folder redirection rule (for the \"Documents\" folder, see https://mizitechinfo.wordpress.com/2014/11/18/simple-step-configure-folder-redirection-in-window-server-2012-r2/)\r\n- In the target tab, select basic configuration to redirect everyone's folder to the same location, with create a folder for each user under the root path (the network share)\r\n- In the settings tab, ensure the user doesn't have exclusive rights to the documents folder (otherwise Myrtille won't be able to access it)\r\n\r\n## Print document\r\nFrom version 1.9.0, myrtille does support local or network printing through a pdf virtual printer, \"**Myrtille PDF**\", installed on the gateway. This feature can be disabled into bin/Myrtille.Services.exe.config (\"FreeRDPPdfPrinter\" key).\r\nIt works like any other printer, using the print feature of your application. The resulting pdf is downloaded to the browser and can be opened/saved/printed from there.\r\nIt can also work standalone (without myrtille integration). If used directly on the gateway (without the \"redirected\" suffix), or as a network printer, it will ask for the pdf output location (to change that default behavior, see bin/Myrtille.Printer.exe.config).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, on Windows 10 / Server 2016, Windows provides a \"Microsoft Print to PDF\" printer. You can thus create a pdf on the remote server then download it (using the file transfer), but it implies an additional step.\r\n\r\nIf your browser machine is on the same network as the gateway or the remote server, you also have the option to use a network printer directly from the remote session.\r\n\r\nIf your remote server have internet access, you can also use a cloud printer (such a Google Print).\r\n\r\n## Security\r\nThe installer can create a self-signed certificate for myrtille (so you can use it at https://myserver/myrtille), but you can set your own certificate (if you wish) to prevent the users from having to add a security exception into their browser.\r\n\r\n## Configuration / Performance tweaks / Debug\r\nBoth the gateway and services have their own .NET config files; the gateway also uses XDT transform files to adapt the settings depending on the current solution configuration.\r\n\r\nYou may also play with the \"js/config.js\" file settings to fine tune the client configuration depending on your needs.\r\n\r\nThe most important client settings (js/config.js) are:\r\n- **imageEncoding**: set the format used to render the display; possible values: AUTO, PNG (default, best performance and quality), JPEG or WEBP. For optimized bandwidth, the recommended setting is AUTO (encode in both PNG and JPEG and send the lowest sized); adjusted dynamically to fit the latency (more latency = switch to JPEG)\r\n- **imageQuality**: set the % quality of the rendering (higher = better); not applicable for PNG (lossless); adjusted dynamically to fit the latency (more latency = switch to JPEG and lower the image quality)\r\n- **imageQuantity**: set the % completeness of the rendering (lower = higher drop rate); useful for low server CPU / bandwidth; use with caution as skipping some images may result in display inconsistencies; adjusted dynamically to fit the latency (more latency = switch to JPEG and lower the image quantity)\r\n- **mouseMoveSamplingRate**: set the % sampling of the mouse moves (lower = higher drop rate); useful to reduce the server load in applications that trigger a lot of updates (i.e.: graphical applications)\r\n- **bufferEnabled**: buffer for user inputs; adjusted dynamically to fit the latency (more latency = more bufferization)\r\n\r\nInto the gateway settings (Web.config):\r\n- **AllowRemoteClipboard**: allow to access the remote clipboard (default enabled)\r\n- **AllowFileTransfer**: allow to upload/download files (default enabled)\r\n- **AllowPrintDownload**: allow to print to pdf (default enabled)\r\n- **AllowSessionSharing**: allow to share a remote session (default enabled); from version 2.0.0, guests can't interact with the shared session (view only)\r\n- **ClientIPTracking**: track the client IP (default disabled) and denies access in case of IP change; this should be disabled in some network configurations: shared proxy, roaming connection, private browsing, etc.\r\n- **ClientIdleTimeout**: disconnect the session after a period of time if the browser window/tab is closed, or connection is lost, to prevent it from being left open server side; default 60000 ms (1 mn). 0 to disable\r\n\r\nInto the services settings (bin/Myrtille.Services.exe.config):\r\n- **RemoteSessionLog**: rdp/ssh client logs (default disabled); stored into the log folder\r\n- **FreeRDPxxx**: rdp client settings; allow to tweak the remote connection options (wallpaper, theme, color depth, audio, etc.). use with caution!\r\n- Multifactor Authentication and Enterprise Mode configuration\r\n\r\nInto the PDF virtual printer settings (bin/Myrtille.Printer.exe.config):\r\n- **OutputFile**: default output file name, if the printer is used standalone (without myrtille integration)\r\n- **AskUserForOutputFilename**: whether to display or not a dialog box to prompt for output file name, if the printer is used standalone\r\n\r\n## Code organization\r\n- **Myrtille.RDP**: link to the myrtille FreeRDP fork. C++ code. RDP client, modified to forward the user input(s) and encode the session display into the configured image format(s). The modified code in FreeRDP is identified by region tags \"#pragma region Myrtille\" and \"#pragma endregion\".\r\n- **Myrtille.SSH**: SSH.NET client. Same logic as for FreeRDP, use named pipes to communicate with the gateway.\r\n- **Myrtille.Common**: C# code. Common helpers. These are static libs which could be used for any project (not only myrtille).\r\n- **Myrtille.Services**: C# code. WCF services, hosted by a Windows Service (or a console application in debug build). start/stop the rdp/ssh client and upload/download file(s) to/from the connected user documents folder.\r\n- **Myrtille.Services.Contracts**: C# code. WCF contracts (interfaces).\r\n- **Myrtille.MFAProviders**: C# code. Multifactor Authentication providers. Currently used with the OASIS adapter but could be any other.\r\n- **Myrtille.Enterprise**: C# code. Integration with Active Directory. Provides a dashboard to administrate the RDP and SSH hosts on a domain.\r\n- **Myrtille.Web**: C# code. IIS Web application; gateway between the browser and the rdp/ssh client; maintain correlation between http(s) and rdp/ssh sessions.\r\n- **Myrtille.Setup**: MSI installer.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\nMyrtille uses C#, C++ and vanilla Javascript code (no additional libraries). Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 was used as primary development environment, using the .NET 4.5 framework.\r\nIf you want Visual Studio to load the Myrtille setup project, you have to install the (official and free) Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (or greater) Installer Projects extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioclient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects).\r\n\r\nThe Myrtille build have the two classic solution configurations: \"Debug\" and \"Release\", on \"Any CPU\" platform.\r\n\r\nStarting from myrtille version 1.1.0, the FreeRDP code (modified for myrtille needs) is no longer part of the myrtille repository.\r\n\r\nThe (new) myrtille FreeRDP code can be found at https://github.com/cedrozor/FreeRDP\r\n\r\nThe objectives are:\r\n- Have a loose coupled dependency between myrtille and FreeRDP (so that FreeRDP could be replaced by another RDP client implementation, if needed)\r\n- Benefits from the latest FreeRDP changes (bugfixes, new features, latest RDP protocol support, etc.), by synchronizing the fork with the FreeRDP repository (periodically, with a stable branch or after ensuring the master branch is stable)\r\n- Extends myrtille to other remote access protocols. The gateway is (always was) protocol agnostic. For example, myrtille could be linked to an SSH client (the same way it's linked to an RDP client), modified to handle the user inputs and display updates\r\n\r\nSteps to build the FreeRDP fork (and have it working with myrtille):\r\n- Git clone https://github.com/cedrozor/FreeRDP.git into \"<myrtille root folder>\\Myrtille.RDP\\FreeRDP\\\" (**NOTE** if using TortoiseGit, the contextual menu won't show the \"Git clone\" option from the \"Myrtille.RDP\" folder; you will have to do it from elsewhere, outside of the myrtille tree; also, don't create the \"FreeRDP\" folder manually, just write it into the clone target path)\r\n- Install OpenSSL; precompiled installers here: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html (use the **32 bits** full version (not the light one))\r\n- Run cmake as detailed here: https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/Build-on-Windows-Visual-C---2012-(32-and-64-bit) to generate the Visual Studio solution and projects accordingly to your dev environment\r\n- Open and build the generated solution\r\n\r\nIf you plan to build the myrtille installer, you have first to build the FreeRDP fork.\r\n\r\nThen, into the installer project, add the following projects outputs (as primary output):\r\n- winpr\r\n- winpr-tools\r\n- freerdp\r\n- freerdp-client\r\n- wfreerdp-client\r\n\r\nThe installer build should now work.\r\n\r\n### Startup projects\r\nIf you want to run Myrtille with Visual Studio, you should set startup projects on the solution in the following order (multiple startup projects):\r\n- Myrtille.Admin.Services (start) * only required by the Myrtille.Admin.Web mockup *\r\n- Myrtille.Services (Start)\r\n- Myrtille.Web (Start)\r\n\r\nYou can choose the browser you want to use by right-clicking an ASPX page into the \"Myrtille.Web\" project and click \"Browse With...\".\r\n\r\nThe FreeRDP executable is intended to be run from the \"Myrtille.RDP\" folder.\r\n\r\nYou can debug FreeRDP, while an rdp session is active, by attaching the debugger to the process \"wfreerdp.exe\" (native code). Same for SSH with \"Myrtille.SSH.exe\" (managed code).\r\n\r\nBefore first run, retrieve (git clone) the myrtille FreeRDP fork (https://github.com/cedrozor/FreeRDP) into the \"Myrtille.RDP\" folder and build it there in order to generate \"wfreerdp.exe\".\r\n\r\nHit F5 to start debugging.\r\n\r\n## Communication\r\n### Overview\r\nweb browser <-> web gateway <-> wcf services <-> client <-> host\r\n\r\n### Protocols\r\nweb browser <-HTTP(S),XMLHTTP,WS(S)-> web gateway <-WCF-> wcf services <-SYSTEM-> rdp/ssh client <-RDP/SSH-> rdp/ssh server\r\n\r\n\"SYSTEM\" is simply starting the client as a local process, and capture the event of it being stopped.\r\n\r\nIn order to speed up the communication between the web gateway and the client, I decided to bypass the wcf services layer and set a direct communication between the two by using named pipes.\r\n\r\nIt has 2 advantages: first, it's a bit faster than using TCP and, second, it guarantees a FIFO unstacking to preserve the images order.\tIt has also a drawback: both the web gateway and the wcf services must be on the same machine.\r\n\r\nAfter weighing pros and cons, I decided to kept it as is because it also has 2 additional benefits: setting up a named pipe in C++ is a bit simpler than a TCP socket (named pipes are handled as simple files) and having a single setup is easier for the end user.\r\n\t\t\r\nweb gateway <-IPC-> rdp/ssh client\r\n\t\r\nHowever, I'm fully aware that it breaks the distributed architecture pattern. Thus, if you want, feel free to move the named pipes management up to the wcf services layer and proxy the data from/to the web gateway.\r\n\r\nThis is a thing to consider if you want to isolate the web gateway from your intranet (into a DMZ for instance) and still be able to connect a machine on it.\r\n\r\n## Multifactor Authentication\r\nEnabling this option allows you to require users to provide a one-time passcode which is validated against a cloud based 2fa authentication platform. This requires a mobile application which can be used to scan QR codes and generate the one-time passcodes; these applications are free from app stores and a popular choice is google authenticator.\r\n\r\nIn addition to 2fa, an access control could be enforced to allow connections only from given areas (geo ip location) and time (not implemented for now).\r\n\r\nThe adapter has been written to use a platform provided by Olive Innovations and named OASIS. It's free to use up to 10 users; to use this service follow these instructions:\r\n\r\n- Visit https://www.oliveinnovations.com and register for free at https://www.oasis2fa.com\r\n- Once logged in, create a User Group (into the menu select User Groups), then click New, input a Name (i.e. Myrtille) and save\r\n- Create a user (choose Users from the menu), then click New, input user details and tick the box to send register by email (**IMPORTANT** the username must be the same as the username you will login with myrtille; when registering via email, the user will have a link to complete the registration) and save. Into the user details page, select the user group created in Step 2\r\nNOTE: If you have enabled Enterprise Mode and wish to sync your Active Directory with OASIS, visit https://www.oliveinnovations.com, go to download area and download the Gateway application; instructions for configuration can be found into the docs on the same website\r\n- Create an application (choose Applications from the menu), then click New, enter a Name and save. You will be directed to the application details page, grant access to the user group created in Step 2\r\n- Within the application page, click the button Application Key, this will display the information to configure myrtille\r\n\r\nOnce these steps are completed, edit [myrtille path]\\bin\\Myrtille.Services.exe.config and uncomment the following appSettings:\r\n- `MFAAuthAdapter`, this is the OASIS MFA adapter\r\n- `OASISApiKey`, this is the API Key found when you clicked Application Key in step 5\r\n- `OASISAppID`, this is the App ID found when you clicked Application Key in step 5\r\n- `OASISAppKey`, this is the App Key found when you clicked Application Key in step 5\r\n- Restart Myrtille.Services windows service to use the new settings\r\n\r\nThe included MFA adapter is written by Olive Innovations Ltd for use with the OASIS platform. This adapter uses a nuget package, OASIS.Integration (https://www.nuget.org/packages/OASIS.Integration/) available open source (https://github.com/OliveInnovations/OASIS/).\r\nIf you wish to create your own MFA adapter, `Myrtille.Services.Contracts` contains the interfaces you need.\r\n\r\n## Enterprise Mode\r\nWhen enabled, the enterprise mode authenticates users against a domain and allows administrators to create hosts connections (which can be restricted to the security groups the authenticated users belongs to).\r\n\r\nHosts are presented into a simple dashboard and can be connected in 1 click.\r\n\r\n**CAUTION** This requires the myrtille machine to have joined the domain or be able to resolve the domain controller FQDN or IP.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise mode provides the following additional features:\r\n- Authenticate users against a domain/active directory instead of a host they wish to connect to\r\n- Allow administrators to define a list of hosts; these hosts are the only hosts the users can connect to\r\n- Access to hosts can be restricted based on the groups the authenticated users belongs to\r\n- Administrators can create a single use session url to a specific host (with specific login credentials) which can be shared with external (non domain) users and only be used once\r\n\r\nTo enable enterprise mode, edit [myrtille path]\\bin\\Myrtille.Services.exe.config and uncomment the following appSettings:\r\n- `EnterpriseAdapter`, this is the adapter to use for enterprise mode\r\n- `EnterpriseAdminGroup`, this is the security group which will define a user as an administrator who can create, edit, delete hosts, define access to hosts and create single use sessions\r\n- `EnterpriseDomain`, this is the name of your domain (i.e. MYDOMAIN or mydomain.local) if myrtille is part of it or the domain controller FQDN or IP otherwise\r\n- Restart Myrtille.Services windows service to use the new settings\r\n\r\nTo specify a custom path for the MyrtilleEnterprise database or use another SQL server, amend Myrtille.Services app.config connectionString\r\n\r\nIf you wish to create your own enterprise adapter (with a different authentication, database or behavior), `Myrtille.Services.Contracts` contains the interfaces you need.\r\n\r\nFrom version 2.8.0, myrtille provides a simplified host management designed for a local administrator, without the need for a domain and without group access restrictions. The default credentials are \"**admin**\"/\"**admin**\" (username/password) and are changed upon first login. See comments into (myrtille path)\\bin\\Myrtille.Services.exe.config.\r\n\r\n## REST APIs\r\n\r\nMyrtille can support custom REST APIs, to have additional controls over connections and remote sessions.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to hide the connection parameters from the end user (browser), you can use (implement) the **IConnectionService** interface to provide connection details from a connection identifier. This API can also be used to track the connections states (connection/disconnection time, exit code, etc.).\r\n\r\nMyrtille also implement a capture API (**ICaptureService**) in order to take screenshots, on demand or periodically, of a remote session display. This could be useful for monitoring user activity on sensitive servers.\r\n\r\nFor an improved sharing experience, you also have a sharing API (**ISharingService**) to manage the invitations for a remote session, the access privileges, track the active connections, disconnect a guest, etc.\r\n\r\nYou can check the related endpoints, methods and params into these interfaces (Myrtille.Services.Contracts) and have your own implementations.\r\n\r\nSee the Myrtille.Admin.Web **mockup** to see how to implement Myrtille into your website and use these APIs.\r\n\r\n## Notes and limitations\r\n- Starting from myrtille version 1.2.0, the packaged FreeRDP and OpenSSL binaries use a statically-linked runtime; that means there is no longer need for the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributables (x86). It's still a good idea to install them however as they will be required if the build options are changed.\r\n\r\n- On Windows Server 2003, there are reported display issues with FreeRDP when using Chinese language. Disabling the glyph cache fixes the issue (myrtille\\bin\\Myrtille.Services.exe.config).\r\n\r\n- On Windows Server 2008 and Windows Workstations (XP/Vista/7/8/10), the FreeRDP remoteApp and shell features don't work. It's not possible to start a remote application from URL. https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues/1669\r\n\r\n- On Windows Server 2012, you may have issues installing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 redistributables (x86) (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31536606/while-installing-vc-redist-x64-exe-getting-error-failed-to-configure-per-machi). To circumvent that, ensure your system is fully updated (Windows updates) first or try to install the package \"Windows8.1-KB2999226-x64.msu\" manually.\r\n\r\n- Safari 5.1.7 doesn't support the IIS 8+ websocket implementation because it's based on an older version of the websocket standard (hybi instead of RFC6455) (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32628211/connecting-to-iis-8-from-safari-5-1-7-by-websocket). Myrtille does fallback to long-polling if websockets aren't supported or fail.\r\n\r\n- Safari 5.1.7 doesn't support xtermjs (SSH terminal); this version of Safari for Windows is not officially supported anymore, so you should use something else anyway.\r\n\r\n- xtermjs (SSH terminal) rendering is not blazing fast; it's functional but don't expect a native putty client, neither in speed and features. Also, remember to refresh (or \"cls\") the terminal often because it gets slower as the DOM fills with data.\r\n\r\n- In order to keep the installation simple, both the myrtille gateway and services are installed on the same machine. They do however conform to a distributed architecture; if needed, given some additionnal code, myrtille services could acts as a proxy, so the gateway could be installed and operate separately (this could be handy if the gateway should go into a DMZ).\r\n\r\n- Keyboard is mapped to english/US (latin QWERTY) layout by default. If you have troubles with some characters/keys not working as expected, try to add that keyboard layout to your server (and select it when connected).\r\n\r\n- To connect an Hyper-V VM, you have to enter the Hyper-V host as server (hostname or address), the guest VM GUID (https://www.petri.com/get-hyper-v-virtual-machine-process-id-and-guid) and a valid user/password on the Hyper-V host (authentication is done locally). The user must be member of the **\"Hyper-V Administrators\"** group or granted access to the VM with the **Grant-VMConnectAccess** cmdlet (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hyper-v/grant-vmconnectaccess?view=win10-ps). The VM will then request authentication on its own (and you will be able to use a domain user, if needed).\r\n\r\n- When connecting an Hyper-V VM, the display is limited to the VM resolution (default 1024 x 768) whatever the client (browser) resolution. You can change that resolution into the advanced display settings of the VM (even directly within the session, if the connected user have enough privileges).\r\n\r\n- If enhanced mode is not supported by the VM, or disabled, the remote clipboard and the \"Myrtille PDF\" virtual printer are not available into the session. See https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57136-turn-off-hyper-v-enhanced-session-mode-windows-10-a.html for Windows 10 and http://www.systemcentercentral.com/what-is-enhanced-session-mode-in-windows-server-2012-r2-hyper-v-and-when-should-i-use-it/ for others versions.\r\n\r\n- The \"Start program from url\" feature doesn't work with an Hyper-V VM connection.\r\n\r\n- in HTML4 mode, data is sent to Myrtille using xhrs; these are limited in size (depends on browser and IIS config), so sending a large block of text with the \"keyboard\" popup may fail in such a case\r\n\r\n- the clipboard synchronization requires Chrome (or async clipboard API support) and HTTPS connection and is limited to text only and 1MB max\r\n\r\n- The left mouse button sometimes doesn't work on Windows Server 2019 (despite the event being sent), when connected to a standard (enhanced mode disabled) Hyper-V console session\r\n\r\n- Hyper-V Linux VMs don't support enhanced mode (except if using xRDP with Ubuntu, see https://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=12429)\r\n\r\n- When the Hyper-V enhanced mode is disabled, the keyboard mapping is limited to en-US only (using RDP scancodes instead of unicode) and the keyboard layout must therefore be configured in en-US (qwerty) in the remote session\r\n\r\n## Troubleshoot\r\nFirst at all, ensure the Myrtille prerequisites are met (see \"Installation\").\r\n\r\nAlso please read notes and limitations above.\r\n\r\n- The installation fails\r\n\t- Prerequisites are not downloaded: the installer was run directly using the MSI file; this exclude the bootstrapper (Setup.exe), whose purpose is to check and download/install the prerequisites if necessary\r\n\t- Prerequisites download fails: MSI installers use Internet Explorer for downloads; ensure the Internet Explorer enhanced security is disabled (server administration tools) and your system clock is up to date\r\n\t- Error 1001: an MSI custom action failed (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vsnetsetup/2012/03/14/msi-installation-fails-while-installing-a-custom-action-with-error-1001-exception-occurred-while-initializing-the-installation/). Ensure the IIS Management Console is enabled (http://stackoverflow.com/a/23263836).\r\n\t- Check the Windows events logs (\"System\", \"Application\", etc.)\r\n\r\n- I can't access http://myserver/myrtille\r\n\t- Ensure IIS is started and \"Myrtille.Web\" application is running on the \"MyrtilleAppPool\" application pool.\r\n\t- If you have IIS 8 or greater, ensure the websocket protocol is enabled (HTML4 clients will automatically fallback to long-polling).\r\n\t- Ensure .NET 4.5 is installed (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6425442/http-error-404-3-not-found-in-iis-7-5/8487214#8487214) and the \"MyrtilleAppPool\" is running on it.\r\n\t- Ensure you have enabled **HTTP Activation** under \".NET Framework 4.5+ Features\" > \"WCF Services\"\r\n\t- You may have to register .NET 4.5 against IIS (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13749138/asp-net-4-5-has-not-been-registered-on-the-web-server)\r\n\t- Ensure the \"Myrtille.Web\" target folder does have enough privileges (should be set automatically by the installer but may depend on specific configurations)\r\n\t- You can have IIS to show a **detailed error information** (in addition to the HTTP error code); see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2640526/detailed-500-error-message-asp-iis-7-5\r\n\r\n- Nothing happens when I click \"Connect!\"\r\n\t- Ensure you entered valid connection information (server address, user credentials, etc.).\r\n\t- Ensure the network traffic (websockets and xmlhttp in particular) is not blocked by a firewall, proxy, reverse proxy, VPN or whatever.\r\n\t- Ensure the \"Myrtille.Services\" Windows service (or console application if running under Visual Studio) is started.\r\n\t- Ensure the RDP (or SSH) client (\"wfreerdp.exe\" or \"Myrtille.SSH.exe\") does exists (into the \"Myrtille.RDP\" or \"Myrtille.SSH\" output folder, if running under Visual Studio, or into the \"bin\" folder otherwise); if not, you need to retrieve (git clone) the myrtille FreeRDP fork into the \"Myrtille.RDP\" folder and build it there.\r\n\t- Ensure the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 redistributables (x86) are installed (control panel > programs > programs and features); they are required by the RDP client (myrtille\\bin\\wfreerdp.exe).\r\n\t- Try to run wfreerdp.exe (just double-click it, no params), into the myrtille binaries folder. if there is a missing dll, or another issue, Windows should popup an error message (i.e.: MSVCR120.dll = MSVC 12 = Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 redistributables, MSVCP140.dll = MSVC 14 = Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 redistributables, etc.). Depending on your build environment and options, you will need the appropriate redistributables.\r\n\t- Check the RDP (or SSH) server configuration (does the user exists, is it a member of the \"Remote Desktop Users\" group, are Remote Desktop CALs valid?, etc.). You can setup it automatically by importing the \"myrtille\\bin\\RDPSetup.reg\" file into registry.\r\n\t- Check the RDP (or SSH) server windows event logs.\r\n\t- Check the gateway windows event logs, particulary regarding .NET.\r\n\t- Retry with debug enabled and check logs (into the \"log\" folder). You can change their verbosity level in config (but be warned it will affect peformance and flood the disk if set too verbose).\r\n\r\n- Reconnection on browser resize (toolbar option) doesn't work\r\n\t- this feature requires the RDS disconnection timeout to be set and greater than 5 secs (to give FreeRDP time to reconnect)\r\n\r\n- Some characters/keys are not working as expected\r\n\t- Keyboard is mapped to english/US layout by default. Try to add that layout to your server (and select it when connected).\r\n\r\n- I don't have a mouse (or a right button), how can I Right-Click? (i.e.: on a touchpad or iOS device)\r\n\t- You can toggle on the \"Right-Click\" button into the toolbar, then touch or left-click the screen to trigger a right-click at that position\r\n\r\n- Nothing happens when I click on some toolbar buttons\r\n- Nothing happens when I print with the \"Myrtille PDF\" redirected printer\r\n\t- Although myrtille dialogs should work (same domain origin policy), ensure you don't have a popup blocker (Chrome have one by default), or disable it or add an exception for the myrtille domain\r\n\r\n- The RDP (or SSH) session continues to run after clicking \"Disconnect\"\r\n\t- Check the RDP (or SSH) server configuration (session disconnect timeout in particular). You can setup it automatically by importing the Myrtille \"myrtille\\bin\\RDPSetup.reg\" file into registry.\r\n\r\n- Myrtille is slow or buggy\r\n\t- Enable the stats bar to have detailed information about the current connection. Check latency and bandwidth, among other things.\r\n\t- Ensure debug is disabled or otherwise logs are not set to \"Information\" level (Myrtille \"Web.Config\" file, \"system.diagnostics\" section, default is \"Warning\"). Check logs, if debug is enabled. **FreeRDP logs can be enabled into bin/Myrtille.Services.exe.config (\"RemoteSessionLog\" key, at the bottom of the file)**. Logs are located into the log folder.\r\n\t- If debug is enabled and you are running Myrtille in debug mode under Visual Studio, you will have the FreeRDP window (session display) and console (rdp events) shown to you. Same for SSH. It may help to debug.\r\n\t- Switch from HTML4 to HTML5 rendering, or inversely (should be faster with HTML5).\r\n\t- Check your network configuration (is something filtering the traffic?) and capabilities (high latency or small bandwidth?).\r\n\t- Ensure buffering is enabled (see configuration / performance tweaks / Debug (#configuration--performance-tweaks--debug))\r\n\t- the SSH terminal (xtermjs) becomes laggy after some time; try to refresh or clear (\"cls\") the screen from time to time\r\n\t- Maybe the default settings are not adapted to your configuration. You can tweak the \"js/config.js\" file as you wish (see extensive comments there).\r\n\t- Despite my best efforts to produce quality and efficient code, I may have missed/messed something... Please don't hesitate to tell me or add your contribution! Thanks! :)\r\n\r\n- The browser loading icon spins indefinitely when I reload the page (or I get websocket error 1006)\r\n\t- IIS on Windows client OSes (7, 8, 10) is limited to 10 simultaneous connections only - across all http sessions - and will hang after that! (https://forums.asp.net/t/2062118.aspx?+limit+of+10+simultaneous+connections+imposed+). Use Windows Server editions for production environments."

if you have a ~ 15 secs delay on each Docker command under Windows, disable NETBIOS over TCP/IP on each of your network adapters (TCP/IP v4 Properties)\n# see https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/2131#issuecomment-505286617\n\n# to list the network adapters available to Docker:\n# docker network ls\n\n# to build the myrtille image (using Docker Desktop or Toolbox), have this Dockerfile and the myrtille installer (.msi file) into a folder, move into this folder then run this command:\n# you also need to provide a network adapter able to download the service monitor during the build. Optionally, you can add a version tag to the image (useful to manage different versions of myrtille)\n# docker build --network=\"<network adapter>\" -t myrtille(:tag) .\n\n# to list the images:\n# docker images\n\n# to run an image (in detached mode) and provide the resulting container a network adapter able to connect your hosts:\n# docker run -d --network=\"<network adapter>\" <image name>(:tag)\n\n# to list the containers:\n# docker ps -a\n\n# to open a shell into a container (and be able to explore it, check its ip address, logs, etc.):\n# docker exec -it <container ID> cmd\n# docker exec -it <container ID> powershell\n\n# to stop a container:\n# docker stop <container ID>\n\n# to commit a container into a new image (and be able to persist its config, data and logs):\n# docker commit <container ID> <image name>(:tag)\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# DISK CLEANUP\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# after a while, you might want to clean the unused containers and images to free some space\n\n# remove all containers (powershell):\n# docker rm $ (docker ps -a -q)\n\n# remove all dangling images:\n# docker image prune\n\n# more help: https://docs.docker.com/"

No extension or administrative rights required. The clipboard synchronization requires Chrome (or async clipboard API support) and HTTPS connection\r\n- Gateway (myrtille): Windows Server OS (2012 R2 or greater, with IIS 8.0+, .NET 4.5+ and WCF/HTTP activation enabled). CAUTION! IIS on Windows client OSes (7, 8, 10 - all versions) is limited to 10 simultaneous connections only - across all http sessions - and will hang after that!\r\n- RDP server: any RDP enabled machine (preferably Windows Server but can also be Windows XP, 7, 8, 10 or Linux xRDP server)\r\n- SSH server: any SSH server (tests were made using the built-in Windows 10 OpenSSH server)\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\nMyrtille supports multiple connections/tabs (can be disabled in web.config, as per the comments there).\r\n\r\nThe maximal number of concurrent users is not limited besides what the RDP (or SSH) server(s) can handle (number of CALs, CPU, RAM?).\r\n\r\nRegarding the gateway, a simple dual-core CPU with 4 GB RAM can handle up to 50 simultaneous sessions (about 50MB RAM by rdp client process, even less for ssh).\r\n\r\nA session uses about 200 KB/s of bandwidth on average. 1 MB/s per user is a good provision for most cases. What's really important to Myrtille is the outgoing bandwidth, as display updates will take up most of the traffic.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio 2017 or greater. See DOCUMENTATION.md.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nAll releases here: https://github.com/cedrozor/myrtille/releases\r\n\r\nSee DOCUMENTATION.md for more details.\r\n\r\n## Docker\r\n\r\nFrom version 2.8.0, Myrtille is available as a Docker image.\r\n\r\nYou can pull it from Docker Hub with the following command (use a tag to get any specific version other than the latest)<br/>\r\n```\r\ndocker pull cedrozor/myrtille(:tag)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the image in detached mode (optionally providing the resulting container a network adapter able to connect your hosts)<br/>\r\n```\r\ndocker run -d (--network=\"<network adapter>\") cedrozor/myrtille(:tag)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee DOCUMENTATION.md for more details.\r\n\r\n## Remote Desktop Services\r\n\r\nThis is the primary requirement for RDP connections. Please read DOCUMENTATION.md for more on the RDS role and features, and how to best configure it for Myrtille.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nOnce installed on your server, you can use Myrtile at http://myserver/myrtille. Set the RDP (or SSH) server address, user domain (if any, for RDP), name and password then click \"Connect\" to log in, and \"Disconnect\" to log out. You can pre-configure connections for one-click access from the dashboard for managing hosts.\r\n\r\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) and Active Directory integration (Enterprise Mode) are both off by default. The documentation will help you turn on these features.\r\n\r\nYou can connect a remote desktop and **start a program automatically from a URL** (see DOCUMENTATION.md). From version 1.5.0, Myrtille does support encrypted credentials (aka \"password 51\" into .rdp files) so the URLs can be distributed to third parties without compromising security.\r\n\r\nThe installer lets you optionally create a self-signed certificate for https://myserver/myrtille. Like for all self-signed certificates, you will have to add a security exception in your web browser (just ignore the warning message and proceed to the website). **Using HTTPS is recommended** to secure your remote connection.\r\nOf course, you can avoid that by installing a certificate provided by a trusted Certification Authority (see DOCUMENTATION.md).\r\n\r\nIf you want connection info, turn on \"Stat\" (displayed on-screen or in the browser console). If you want debug info, turn on \"Debug\" (most traces are turned off (by being commented out) in the .js files, but can be turned on (by uncommenting them) as needed).\r\n\r\nYou can also choose HTML4 or HTML5 rendering mode, (HTML4 may be useful, for example, if websockets are blocked by a proxy or firewall).\r\n\r\nOn touchscreen devices, you can pop out the device keyboard with the \"Keyboard\" button.\r\nThen enter some text and click \"Send\". This can be used, for example, to paste the local clipboard content and send it to the server (then it be copied from there, within the remote session).\r\nAlternatively, you can run **osk.exe** (the Windows on screen keyboard, located into %SystemRoot%\\System32) within the remote session.\r\nIt can be started automatically opon beginning a Windows session (https://www.cybernetman.com/kb/index.cfm/fuseaction/home.viewArticles/articleId/197).\r\n\r\nThe remote clipboard content can also be retrieved locally with the \"Clipboard\" button (text format only).\r\n\r\nYou can upload/download file(s) to/from the user documents folder with the \"Files\" button.\r\nNote that it requires the RDP server to be localhost (same machine as the HTTP server) or a domain to be specified. Not available for SSH.\r\n\r\nYou can print any document on a local or network printer by using the \"Myrtille PDF\" (redirected) virtual printer.\r\nSimply use the print feature of your application, then open/print the downloaded pdf.\r\n\r\nFrom version 2.1.0, you can connect an Hyper-V VM directly (console session). It can be useful if remote desktop access is not enabled on the VM (i.e: Linux VMs), if the VM doesn't have a network connection (or is on a different network for security reasons, or use DHCP) or simply to be able to connect the VM during system startup or shutdown.\r\nSee [notes and limitations](https://github.com/cedrozor/myrtille/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#notes-and-limitations) for info to connect an Hyper-V VM and the differences with a standard RDP connection.\r\n\r\n## Third-party\r\nMyrtille uses the following libre software:\r\n\r\n- RDP client: [FreeRDP](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP), [licensed Apache 2.0](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/master/LICENSE).
