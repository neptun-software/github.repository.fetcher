Simply filing issues for the problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing code via PRs is greatly appreciated!\n\nBelow is our guidance for how to file bug reports, propose new features, and submit contributions via Pull Requests (PRs).\n\nFor contributors who are willing to translate the app to their language of interest see [this section on how to do it](#translation-contribution-guidelines).\n\nNote that all community interactions must abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Before you start, file an issue\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track bugs and features. It helps us to prioritize tasks and make our plan.\n\nPlease follow this simple rule to help us eliminate any unnecessary wasted effort & frustration, and ensure an efficient and effective use of everyone's time - yours, ours, and other community members':\n\n> If you have a question, think you've discovered an issue, would like to propose a new feature, etc., then find/file an issue **BEFORE** starting work to fix/implement it.\n\n### Search existing issues first\n\nBefore filing a new issue, search existing open and closed issues first: It is likely someone else has found the problem you're seeing, and someone may be working on or have already contributed a fix!\n\nIf no existing item describes your issue/feature, great - please file a new issue:\n\n### File a new Issue\n\n* Experienced a bug or crash? [File a bug report](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=Bug%3A)\n* Got a great idea for a new feature or have a suggestion? [File a feature request](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/issues/new?labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=Feature+Request%3A)\n* Want ModernFlyouts to support your language of interest? (or) Update/Correct existing translations? [File a Language request/translation issue](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/issues/new?assignees=Samuel12321&labels=translation&template=language-or-translation-issue-or-request-.md&title=)\n* Don't know whether you're reporting a bug or requesting a feature? [File an issue](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=blank-issue.md&title=)\n* Found an existing issue that describes yours? Great - upvote and add additional commentary / info / repro-steps / etc.\n* Want to know if we're planning on building a particular feature? (or) Don't understand how to do something? (or) Have a question that you don't see answered in this repo? [Connect with us](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts#connect-with-us) and ask our team and the community to get your doubts cleared. (Please don't open issues just for questions or doubts)\n\nWe provide some basic issue templates. If none of them suit your need, you can start from a blank issue.\n\n## Code Contribution guidelines\n\nBefore contributing any code via PRs to **ModernFlyouts**, please **file a new issue** regarding it and ask for the teams approval.\nIf you want to implement or fix any existing issues, please leave a comment on the issue notifying us about your will to contribute code.\nWe'll then give you some guidelines regarding the project and source code structure and stuffs. Now, let's get back on how to contribute code to **ModernFlyouts**.\n\n### Code contribution process\n\n- [Setup and build environment](docs/developer_guide.md)\n- [Contribution Workflow](docs/contribution_workflow.md)\n\n### Copying files from other projects\n\nDon't steal code from others! Only we can do that. Just kidding.\nThe following rules must be followed for PRs that include files from another project:\n\n- The license of the file is [permissive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license).\n- The license of the file is left intact.\n- The contribution is correctly attributed in the [3rd party notices](NOTICE.md) file in the repository, as needed.\n\n## Translation Contribution guidelines\n\nFirst of all, we must thank you for stepping forward to contribute support a language!\nWe know how time consuming and hard it is to translate the text resources used by this app. Unfortunately in the past we had to ask some contributors to redo all their work from scratch due to some technical difficulties on our side. That's why we want you to know these pre-cautions to be taken before contributing translations.\n\n**Read these docs first:** [Setup and build environment](docs/developer_guide.md) and [Contribution Workflow](docs/contribution_workflow.md).\n\nPlease remember these points! We have suffered enough pain telling contributors to redo their work.\n\n- **(!!!Important!!!)** The files you need to translate are present in the [ModernFlyouts/MultilingualResources](ModernFlyouts/MultilingualResources) directory.\n- The **RESX files** (i.e. **Strings.(lang-code).resx** ) present inside the [ModernFlyouts/Properties](ModernFlyouts/Properties) directory are intended for internal use and are modified every time the project is built.\n- Only the **ModernFlyouts.(lang-code).xlf** files present inside the [ModernFlyouts/MultilingualResources](ModernFlyouts/MultilingualResources) directory are stable and intended to be translated by contributors.\n- Please don't modify any files other than file related to your target language! Which is **ModernFlyouts.(lang-code).xlf** for e.g. **ModernFlyouts.en-GB.xlf**.\n"

It will be hidden temporarily while this application is running. So, no reason to fear breaking your system.\n> For more information on how to recover the original flyouts, check out [this How To page](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/wiki/How-Tos).\n\n> Users are provided the freedom to choose between the Windows built-in flyouts or modern flyouts from ModernFlyouts or neither of them.\n\n> It is impossible to have a flyout for the keyboard backlight brightness or the function (Fn) key because they are not passed as keys but as hardware signals (which the OEMs decide).  Any OS can receive those signals if they have the required driver.\n\n### Please check out [the Wiki](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/wiki) for additional information, guides and how-tos.\n\n### Please check out [this document](docs/GSMTC-Support-And-Popular-Apps.md) for support regarding your media player/browser.\n\n------------------------\n\n## Features  ✨\n\n- Fluent Design based UI.\n- Supports **Light** and **Dark** mode.\n- Redesigned **Volume + Media**, **Brightness** and **Airplane mode** flyouts.\n- Media Controls have support for (not all app support the whole feature set. [More on this](docs/GSMTC-Support-And-Popular-Apps.md))\n  - **Shuffle**,\n  - **Repeat**,\n  - **Stop**\n  - and **Timeline Info**.\n- Additional flyouts **Lock keys** and **Insert/Overtype**.\n- Each module can be **disabled individually**.\n- Fully customizable layout settings, i.e.\n  - Auto or Manual Placement mode,\n  - Flyout Alignment,\n  - Flyout content stacking direction.\n- Flyout's TopBar can be pinned, unpinned or hidden.\n- Flyout is **Draggable** and autosaves the position. It also has feature for default position. (Check out the settings)\n- Supports multi-monitor setup and users can select which monitor to show the flyout on.\n- Smooth **Animations** & **Transitions**.\n- **Opacity** of the background of flyouts can be changed.\n- **Timeout** of flyouts is customizable.\n\n------------------------\n\n## System Requirements  🖥️\n- **Windows 11**\n- **Windows 10 1809 and above** \n> older versions such as [v0.3](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/releases/tag/v0.3.0) and below support Windows 10 1803 downlevel till Windows 8, however v0.4 and above won't.\n\n------------------------\n\n## Installation  ⬇️\n\nModern Flyouts is available for you to install via  [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9MT60QV066RP), [GitHub](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/releases/latest), winget and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/modernflyouts).\n\nAll the distribution methods mentioned above are supported, however installing the app from the **Microsoft Store** is **recommended** as it is easier to install and will automatically remain up to date.\n\n**Microsoft Store**\n\n<a href='https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9MT60QV066RP?ocid=badge'><img src='https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/store/badges/images/English_get-it-from-MS.png' alt='Microsoft Store' width='160'/></a>\n\n**GitHub**\n\n1.

Since the project was stale for a while and it lacked support for brightness and airplane mode flyouts, this project was born. He not only let us use his source code but also helped us improve this app. And he still supports us 😄.\nI must admit that this project wouldn't be here *how it is* without **[ADeltaX](https://github.com/ADeltaX/)**. Our heartful thanks to him ❤.\n\nWe must also say a big thanks to [our contributors](https://github.com/ModernFlyouts-Community/ModernFlyouts/graphs/contributors) for helping us with some important bug fixes, adding features and localization.\n\n### Our Team \n\n- **[ShankarBUS](https://github.com/ShankarBUS/)** - Ex-Maintainer/co-owner & Developer.\n- **[ADeltaX](https://github.com/ADeltaX/)** - Developer of innovative solutions to circumvent microsoft rubbish\n- **[FireCubeStudios](https://github.com/FireCubeStudios/)** - Developer/Maintainer.\n- **[Samuel12321](https://github.com/Samuel12321/)** - Maintainer/co-owner of this repository and application publisher (including **Microsoft Store**).\n- **[PrakharB5](https://github.com/prakharb5)** - Repository Maintainer.\n\n### Dependencies and References\n\n- [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio)\n- [ModernWpf](https://github.com/Kinnara/ModernWpf) (Inspired the name **Modern**Flyouts)\n- [Hardcodet.NotifyIcon.Wpf](https://github.com/hardcodet/wpf-notifyicon)\n\n------------------------\n\n## Beta Builds  🚧\n\nThe ability to signup for beta builds has been temporarily disabled while we work on a better way to release and manage them. Beta builds will still occasionally be available to download fron the releases tab on github. Thank to everyone who help us test new releases and find bugs before they go public.\n\n------------------------\n\n## Screenshots  📷\n\nScreenshots are temporarily removed 😅. They will be restored during v1.0 release cycle.\n"
