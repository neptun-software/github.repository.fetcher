You will need to manually replace any UI using the older ```Text``` component and replace them with ```TextMeshPro``` versions. This is unavoidable due to Unity deprecating the Text component.\n\n> New users to 2022 are unaffected as all the Editor commands have been updated to use the newer TextMeshPro versions.\n\nFor more details, see the [deprecation notice](https://github.com/Unity-UI-Extensions/com.unity.uiextensions/discussions/428) on GitHub.\n\n## Added\n\n- Add CalculatePointOnCurve for uilinerenderer (@victornor)\n\n## Changed\n\n- fix: Fixed an null reference exception with the ResetSelectableHighlight (@FejZa)\n- fix: Resolved an issue where the last line in a flow layout group would overflow the rect bounds.\n- fix: GetPosition when Segments is null (@victornor)\n- fix: Fix Bug! NicerOutline color.a Loss when m_UseGraphicAlpha is true (wanliyun)\n- fix: Update to force Enumerated start for Accordion elements, Resolves: #455\n- Added argument to the UpdateLayout method for the HSS/VSS to move to a new starting page.\n- Updated implementations to handle 2023 support, with 2023 moving in to public release.\n- Added extra event on the AutoCompleteComboBox, to fire when an item in the list is selected, with its display name.\n- FlowLayoutGroup components updated to latest (likely the last as the author has stopped development)\n\n## Deprecated\n\n- All deprecated Text based components now have \"obsolete\" tags, to avoid breaking code.  Note, these do not function in 2022 and above, as Unity have \"changed\" things.  For any affected component, I recommend updating to use TextMeshPro native features.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n### [Installation Instructions](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/UPMInstallation.html)\n\nThe recommended way to add the Unity UI Extensions project to your solution is to use the Unity package Manager. Simply use the Unity Package Manager to reference the project to install it\n\nNew for 2020, we have added OpenUPM support and the package can be installed using the following [OpenUPM CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/) command:\n\n```cli\n`openupm add com.unity.uiextensions`\n```\n\n> For more details on using [OpenUPM CLI, check the docs here](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli#installation).\n\n- Unity Package Manager - manual\n\nAlternatively, you can also add the package manually through the Unity package manager using the scope ```com.unity.uiextensions```, see the [Unity Package Manager docs](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/the-package-manager) for more information.\n\n- Unity 2018 or lower\nThe pre-compiled Unity assets are the only solution for Unity 2018 or earlier due to the changes in the Unity UI framework in Unity made for 2019.\nEither clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.\n\n### Upgrade Notes\n\n### UPM\n\nIf you are using UPM to gain access to the Unity UI Extensions, then you only need to update to the latest version in the Package Manager, no other changes needed.\n\n### Customers using the .UnityPackage\n\nDue to the restructure of the package to meet Unity's new package guidelines, we recommend **Deleting the current Unity UI Extensions** folder prior to importing the new package.\n\nFor Unity 2019 users using the new UPM deployment, be sure to delete the existing folder in your assets folder before adding the new package to avoid conflict.\n"

These are just here as starter scenes for doing UI tasks in the book.\r\n\r\nI will add more sample scenes for the UI examples in this repository and detail them above over time.\r\n\r\n## [Previous Releases](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/Downloads)\r\n\r\nPlease see the [full downloads list](https://unity-ui-extensions.github.io/Downloads) for all previous releases and their corresponding download links.\r\n"
