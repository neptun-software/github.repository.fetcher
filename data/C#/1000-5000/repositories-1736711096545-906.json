The SDK enables mobile app developers to\nmaximize their monetization in native mobile apps.\n\nThis repository contains the source code for the Google Mobile Ads Unity\nplugin. This plugin enables Unity developers to easily serve Google Mobile Ads\non Android and iOS apps without having to write Java or Objective-C code.\nThe plugin provides a C# interface for requesting ads that is used by C#\nscripts in your Unity project.\n\n## Downloads\n\nPlease import the plugin using\n[Unity Package Manager](https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/quick-start#import_the_mobile_ads_for_unity_plugin)\nor download the package from the\n[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-unity/releases).\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor instructions on using the plugin, please refer to\n[this developer guide](https://developers.google.com/admob/unity/quick-start).\n\nFor a sample application demonstrating how to use Google Mobile Ads see [The HelloWorld Unity project](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-unity/tree/main/samples).\n\n## Suggesting improvements\n\nTo file bugs, make feature requests, or to suggest other improvements,\nplease use [github's issue tracker](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-unity/issues).\n\nBe sure to also join the developer community on\n[our forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!categories/google-admob-ads-sdk/game-engines).\n\n## License\n\n[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)\n"
