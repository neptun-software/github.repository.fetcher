          "content": "# A Short Note about the future of geometry3Sharp\n\nI have not been able to work on or maintain geometry3Sharp for the past few years, due to some restrictive employment-contract terms. Various forks now exist that have active maintainers, and I would recommend you consider switching to one of those. In particular I would recommend the geometry4Sharp fork being developed by New Wheel Technology (_who also does C# development consulting, if you are looking for that_):\n\nhttps://github.com/NewWheelTech/geometry4Sharp\n\n# geometry3Sharp\n\nOpen-Source (Boost-license) C# library for geometric computing. \n\ngeometry3Sharp is compatible with Unity. Set the G3_USING_UNITY Scripting Define and you will have transparent interop between g3 and Unity vector types (*see details at the very bottom of this README*). Although the library is written for C# 4.5, if you are using the .NET 3.5 Unity runtime, it will still work, just with a few missing features.\n\nCurrently there is a small amount of unsafe code, however this code is only used in a few fast-buffer-copy routines, which can be deleted if you need a safe version (eg for Unity web player).\n\n[A Nuget Package is available](https://www.nuget.org/packages/geometry3Sharp). This package is updated roughly monthly from the github master branch. So, it's \"more\" stable. Currently this package includes .NET 4.5 and .NET Standard 2.0 dlls. If you would like others, please email and they can be added.\n\nQuestions?

Reasonably good knot-interval sampling of NURBS curves, does the right things with sharp knots.\n- **PlanarComplex2**: assembly of open and closed IParametricCurve2d curves, as well as point-samplings. Chaining of curves into sequences. Extraction of clean closed loops with interior holes, determined by polygon containment. \n- **GeneralPolygon2d**: outer polygon with interior polygonal holes, with configurable outer/inner clockwise-ness\n- **PlanarSolid2d**: parametric variant of GeneralPolygon2D\n- **SampledArcLengthParam**: arc-length parameterization of polylines\n- **DGraph2**: dynamic arbitrary-topology 2D graph (nodes and edges). 2D variant of **DMesh3**.\n- **DGraph2Resampler**: remesher for DGraph2\n- **DGraph2Util**: utilities for DGraph2, ExtractCurves, DisconnectJunctions, ...\n- **Hexagon2**: hexagon type w/ hex-math\n- **PolygonFont2d**: GPolygon2d representation of font outlines, generate fonts with **gsPolyFontGenerator** tool in [gsMeshUtilities](https://github.com/gradientspace/gsMeshUtilities).\n\n## 2D Computational Geometry\n\n- **ConvexHull2**: 2D convex hull, compute w/ doubles or 64-bit integers\n- **Arrangement2d**: compute 2D line-segmenent *arrangement*, ie find split inserted line segments at intersection points\n- **GraphSplitter2D**: Bisect existing DGraph w/ infinite lines (simpler than Arrangment2d)\n- **GraphCells2D**: extract enclosed regions (\"cells\") from a DGraph2, as boundary loops\n\n\n## 3D Curves\n\n- **DCurve3**: 3D polyline\n- **CurveUtil**: queries like Ray/curve intersection based on curve thickness, nearest index, etc\n- **InPlaceIterativeCurveSmooth**, **SculptMoveDeformation**, **ArcLengthSoftTranslation**: simple DCurve3 deformers\n- **CurveResampler**: edge split/collapses resampling of a 3D polyline \n- **Circle3d**\n- **SampledArcLengthParam**: arc-length parameterization discrete-sampled 3D curve\n- **DGraph3**: dynamic arbitrary-topology 3D graph (nodes and edges), 3D variant of DGraph2\n- **DGraph3Util**: ExtractCurves, DisconnectJunctions, etc\n\n## 3D Solids\n\n- **Cylinder3d**\n- **DenseGridTrilinearImplicit**: trilinear interpolant of 3D grid\n- **CachingDenseGridTrilinearImplicit**: variant of DenseGridTrilinearImplicit that does lazy evaluation of grid values based on an implicit function\n\n\n## I/O    \n    \n- format-agnostic **StandardMeshReader** and **StandardMeshWriter**\n    - can register additional format handlers beyond supported defaults\n    - constructs mesh via generic interface, **SimpleMeshBuilder** and **DMesh3Builder** provided\n- readers & writers configurable via **ReadOptions** and **WriteOptions**\n- **OBJReader/Writer** - supports vertex colors extension, read/write face groups, UVs, OBJ .mtl files\n    - stores texture map paths but you have to load images yourself\n    - currently **cannot** produce meshes with multiple UVs per vertex (not supported in DMesh3), vertices will be duplicated along UV seams\n- **STLReader/Writer**: STL format, basic vertex welding to reconstruct topology\n- **OFFReader/Writer**: OFF file format\n- **gSerialization**: binary Store/Restore functions for many g3 types / data structures\n- **SVGWriter**: write 2D geometric elements in svg format\n\n\n\n\n## Misc\n\n- 2D implicit blobs\n- 2D Marching Quads\n\n\n\n\n# Unity Interop\n\ngeometry3Sharp supports transparent conversion with Unity types.\nTo enable this, define **G3_USING_UNITY** in your Unity project, by adding this\nstring to the **Scripting Define Symbols** box in the **Player Settings**.  \n\nOnce enabled, code like this will work transparently:\n\n~~~~\nVector3 unityVec;\nVector3f g3Vec;\nunityVec = g3vec;\ng3vec = unityVec;\n~~~~\n\nfloat->double types will work transparently, while double->float will require an explicit cast:\n\n~~~~\nVector3d g3vecd;\ng3vecd = gameObject.transform.position;\ngameObject.transform.position = (Vector3)g3vecd;\n~~~~\n\nThis will work for **Vector2**, **Vector3**, **Quaterion**, **Ray**, **Color**, and **Bounds** (w/ AxisAlignedBox3f)\nNote that these conversions will **not** work for equations, so to add a Vector3f and a Vector3, you\nwill need to explicitly cast one to the other.\n\n"
