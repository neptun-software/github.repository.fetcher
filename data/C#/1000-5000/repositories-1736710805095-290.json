Before deploying 6.0 delete both Azure App Functions and the Azure App Service plan before upgrading. This is required because we have migrated the service from `python` to `C#`.\n\nAfter deployment, there will be two App Functions deployed, one with the name of the deployment and a second one with the same name and a `-net` suffix. This is a temporary situation and the `-net` app function will be removed in a following release.\n\nIf you have not used the deployment parameters to deploy C# functions in 5.20, you can manually delete the `-net` app function immediately. Deploying the C# functions was not a default action in 5.20, for most deployments deleting the `-net` app function immediately is ok.\n\n### Deprecation of jinja templates\n\nWith this release we are moving from jinja templates to [scriban](https://github.com/scriban/scriban) templates. See the documentation for [scriban here](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/tree/master/doc).\n\nVersion 6.0 will convert jinja templates on-the-fly for a short period of time. We do **_not_** guarantee that this will be successful for all jinja template options. These on-the-fly conversions are not persisted in the notifications table in this release. They will be in a following release. This will allow time for conversions of templates that are not handled by the current automatic conversion process.\n\n### CLI\n\nThe default value for the `--container_type` parameter to the `container` command has been removed. The `container_type` parameter is still required for the command. This change removes the ambiguity of the container information being returned.\n\n### Added\n\n* Agent: Added `machine_id` a parameter of the agent config. [#2649](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/2649)\n* Agent: Pass the `machine_id` from the Agent to the Task. [#2662](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/2662)\n\n### Changed\n\n* Service: Deployment enables refactored C# App Function. [#2650](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/2650)\n* CLI: Attempt to use broker or browser login instead of device flow for authentication. Canceling the attempt with `Ctrl-C` will fall back to using the device flow. [#2612](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/pull/2612)\n* Service: Update to .NET 7.

This way we can actually\n> measure how impactful an issue is.\n\n## Contributing fixes / features\n\nFor those able & willing to help fix issues and/or implement features ...\n\n### To Spec or not to Spec\n\nSome issues/features may be quick and simple to describe and understand. For\nsuch scenarios, once a team member has agreed with your approach, skip ahead to\nthe section headed \"Fork, Branch, and Create your PR\", below.\n\nSmall issues that do not require a spec will be labelled Issue-Bug or\nIssue-Task.\n\nHowever, some issues/features will require careful thought & formal design\nbefore implementation. For these scenarios, we'll request that a spec is\nwritten and the associated issue will be labeled Issue-Feature.\n\nSpecs help collaborators discuss different approaches to solve a problem,\ndescribe how the feature will behave, how the feature will impact the user,\nwhat happens if something goes wrong, etc. Driving towards agreement in a spec,\nbefore any code is written, often results in simpler code, and less wasted\neffort in the long run.\n\nSpecs will be managed in a very similar manner as code contributions so please\nfollow the \"Fork, Branch and Create your PR\" below.\n\n### Writing / Contributing-to a Spec\n\nTo write/contribute to a spec: fork, branch and commit via PRs, as you would\nwith any code changes.\n\nSpecs are written in markdown, stored under the `\\doc\\spec` folder and named\n`[issue id] - [spec description].md`.\n\n> 👉 **It is important to follow the spec templates and complete the requested\n> information**. The available spec templates will help ensure that specs\n> contain the minimum information & decisions necessary to permit development\n> to begin.  In particular, specs require you to confirm that you've already\n> discussed the issue/idea with the team in an issue and that you provide the\n> issue ID for reference.\n\nTeam members will be happy to help review specs and guide them to completion.\n\n### Help Wanted\n\nOnce the team have approved an issue/spec, development can proceed. If no\ndevelopers are immediately available, the spec can be parked ready for a\ndeveloper to get started. Parked specs' issues will be labeled \"Help Wanted\".\nTo find a list of development opportunities waiting for developer involvement,\nvisit the Issues and filter on [the Help-Wanted\nlabel](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/labels/Help%20Wanted).\n\n## Development\n\n### Fork, Clone, Branch and Create your PR\n\nOnce you've discussed your proposed feature/fix/etc. with a team member, and\nyou've agreed an approach or a spec has been written and approved, it's time to\nstart development:\n\n1. Fork the repo if you haven't already\n1. Clone your fork locally\n1. Create & push a feature branch\n1. Create a [Draft Pull Request (PR)](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)\n1. Work on your changes\n1. Try to follow the existing style of the related code as closely as possible.\n\n#### Python Specific\n\n1. Provide as much context in typing variables as possible.  Example:\n   `Dict[UUID, int]` is better than `Any`.\n1. For a complex set of data, consider using objects (such as\n   [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) typed data classes) rather\n   than nested Dicts, Tuples, or Lists.\n\n### Local Build Prerequisites\n\nOneFuzz is built with multiple components and runs on Linux and Windows:\n\n* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (latest stable)\n* [Python](https://www.python.org) (at least 3.7 or later)\n* [Azure Functions Core\n  Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)\n(latest version of the 4.x)\n\nWhile local builds are possible for every component of the system, new\ncontributors may find [automatic builds for\nPRs](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)\nbeneficial.\n\n### Getting the sources\n\nFirst, fork the OneFuzz repository so that you can make a pull request. Then,\nclone your fork locally:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/<<<your-github-account>>>/onefuzz.git\n```\n\nOccasionally you will want to merge changes in the upstream repository (the\nofficial code repo) with your fork.\n\n```\ncd onefuzz\ngit checkout main\ngit pull https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz.git main\n```\n\nManage any merge conflicts, commit them, and then push them to your fork.\n\n> 👉 The `microsoft/onefuzz` repository contains GitHub Actions that\n> automatically build OneFuzz as well as triage components during our\n> development. As you may not want these running on your fork, you can disable\n> Actions for your fork by via \n> `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/onefuzz/settings/actions`.\n\n### Deploying from a build\n\nThese instructions assume a working python 3.7 (or later) install and a\nlogged-in Azure CLI session.\n\n1. Download the `release-artifacts` from your CICD build.\n2. Create a new directory for the release artifacts\n3. Unzip the `release-artifacts.zip` into this new directory\n4. Unzip the resulting zip file that starts with `onefuzz-deployment`\n5. Setup a python virtual environment.  example: `python3 -m venv onefuzz-deploy-venv`\n6. Activate the virtual environment. example: `. onefuzz-deploy-venv/bin/activate`\n7. Install python-wheel. example: `pip install wheel`\n8. Install the deployment prerequisites.  Example: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n9. Run the deployment script: Example: `python deploy.py ${REGION} ${GROUP} ${INSTANCE} ${OWNER}`\n\n### Code Review\n\nWhen you'd like the team to take a look, (even if the work is not yet\nfully-complete), mark the PR as 'Ready For Review' so that the team can review\nyour work and provide comments, suggestions, and request changes. It may take\nseveral cycles, but the end result will be solid, testable, conformant code\nthat is safe for us to merge.\n\nWe will treat community PR's with the same level of scrutiny and rigor as\ncommits submitted by our internal team.\n\n### Merge\n\nOnce your code has been reviewed and approved by the requisite number of team\nmembers, it will be merged into the master branch. Once merged, your PR will be\nautomatically closed.\n\n## Thank you\n\nThank you in advance for your contribution!\n"

As such, we are regretfully archiving the project to focus our attention on becoming a more deeply integrated service within the company. Unfortunately, we aren’t a large enough team to live in both the open-source world and the internal Microsoft world with its own unique set of requirements._**\n \n**_Our current plan is to archive the project in the next few months. That means we’ll still be making updates for a little while. Of course, even after it’s archived, you’ll still be able to fork it and make the changes you need. Once we’ve decided on a specific date for archiving, we’ll update this readme._**\n \n**_Thanks for taking the journey with us._**\n\n**_The OneFuzz team._**\n\n---\n**_Update: September 15 2023:_**\n**_Our current target to archive the project is September 30th, 2023._**\n\n---\n\n[![Onefuzz build status](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain)\n\n## A self-hosted Fuzzing-As-A-Service platform\n\nProject OneFuzz enables continuous developer-driven fuzzing to proactively\nharden software prior to release.  With a [single \ncommand](docs/getting-started.md#launching-a-job), which can be [baked into\nCICD](contrib/onefuzz-job-github-actions/README.md), developers can launch\nfuzz jobs from a few virtual machines to thousands of cores.\n\n## Features\n\n* **Composable fuzzing workflows**: Open source allows users to onboard their own \n   fuzzers, [swap instrumentation](docs/custom-analysis.md), and manage seed inputs. \n* **Built-in ensemble fuzzing**: By default, fuzzers work as a team to share strengths, \n   swapping inputs of interest between fuzzing technologies.\n* **Programmatic triage and result de-duplication**: It provides unique flaw cases that \n   always reproduce.\n* **On-demand live-debugging of found crashes**: It lets you summon a live debugging\n   session on-demand or from your build system.\n* **Observable and Debug-able**: Transparent design allows introspection into every \n   stage.\n* **Fuzz on Windows and Linux**: Multi-platform by design. Fuzz using your own [OS \n   build](docs/custom-images.md), kernel, or nested hypervisor.\n* **Crash reporting notification callbacks**: Including [Azure DevOps Work\n   Items](docs/notifications/ado.md) and [Microsoft Teams\n   messages](docs/notifications/teams.md)\n\nFor information, check out some of our guides:\n* [Terminology](docs/terminology.md)\n* [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)\n* [Supported Platforms](docs/supported-platforms.md)\n* [More documentation](docs)\n\nAre you a Microsoft employee interested in fuzzing?
