The animation map for vertex shader to modify the vertex position of the mesh at runtime. Useing GPU instancing to reduce draw calls. \n\n#### Supporting Shadows\n[![](https://assetstorev1-prd-cdn.unity3d.com/package-screenshot/9e708bba-1a7d-4df6-8c1d-f209a8052f84.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUNq5sDMAg8 \"\")\n\n\n#### Using Unity’s AR Foundation to create 10,000 toy soldiers in the real world on an Old iPhone 7.\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/choBOPO1xgo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=choBOPO1xgo \"\")\n\n\nThe initial version was released on GitHub on 30 Jul 2017, and of course, it is still on GitHub. However, if you can buy me **a cup of coffee**, I will be very\nhappy :-).\n\n[:heart: Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/chenjd)\n\n[:heart: Animation Baker and Instancing for Animated Characters on Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/animation-baker-and-instancing-for-animated-characters-183598)\n\nRecently I added support for Unity 2023 and the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), so it can be used from Unity 5.X to Unity 2023.\n\nAnd I will create a video tutorial to demonstrate how to use it. If you want to know more about the implementation behind it, you can read this [article](https://medium.com/chenjd-xyz/how-to-render-10-000-animated-characters-with-20-draw-calls-in-unity-e30a3036349a) I wrote.\n\n#### Features:\n✅ Support Unity 2023.\n\n✅ Support Shadows.\n\n✅ Using the animation map to modify the position of vertices of your characters at runtime to avoid a lot of cost of skin calculation.\n\n✅ Using GPU Instancing to reduce the number of draw calls, only 20 draw calls are\nneeded to render 10,000 soldiers playing attack actions in the demo scene.\n\n✅ Using the animation map to modify the position of vertices of your characters at runtime to avoid a lot of cost of skin calculation.\n\n✅ Using GPU Instancing to reduce the number of draw calls, only 20 draw calls are needed to render 10,000 cats playing idle actions in the demo scene.\n\n✅ Support AR Foundation.\n\n✅ Support URP(SRP Batcher)only 7 draw calls are needed to render 10,000 cats playing idle actions in the demo scene.\n\n#### Model Resource Link：\n\n[RTS Mini Legion Footman Handpainted](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/86576)\n\n---\n#### Bake legacy animation info into anim map：\n\n![1201111111111111.gif](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/1372105-004a0ddd0f256df1.gif?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip)\n\n\n\n![120111111111111.gif](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/1372105-35954dfd4ca03f7b.gif?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip)\nanimated characters without animator & skinnedmeshrender.\n\n#### GPU Instancing & mesh render for large number of animated characters：\n![1372105-fa2cb8df2d12c0b3.gif](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/1372105-310c57df8cfc83bc.gif?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip)\n10,000 animated characters with 22 drawcalls.\n\n\n\n"
