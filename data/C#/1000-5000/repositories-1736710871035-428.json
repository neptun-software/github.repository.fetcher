This is to avoid \nconfusion with what version of tesseract is used. This does that semantic versioning is no longer \nused however breaking changes will be kept to the absolute minimum, even between major tesseract \nreleases, and clearly denoted here if they are required.\n\n* Updated to Tesseract 4.1.0  [Issue 321](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/issues/321)\n* Support integration with System.Drawing in .net core using Tesseract.Drawing [#477](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/issues/477)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n* Requires VC++ 2019 runtime\n* Dropped support for .net framework 2.0 [491](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/issues/491)\n\n#### Known issues\n\n* Setting regions of interest doesn't work [Issue 489](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/issues/489)\n* PageSegMode.SingleBlockVertText does not work [Issue 490](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/issues/490)\n\n### Version 4.0.0 (never officially released)\n\n* Updated to Tesseract 4.0.0 [Issue 321](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/issues/321)\n* Requires VC++ 2017 runtime\n\n### Version 3.2.0\n\n* Support for .Net Standard 2.0 (.net Core 2) -

[Issue 232](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/issues/232)\n\n### Version 3.0.0 (Tesseract 3.04)\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n* Requires VS 2013 runtime as the included Tesseract binaries are now compiled with VS 2013.\n\n#### Other Changes\n\n* Update Tesseract binaries to 3.04 - [Issue 168](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/issues/168)\n* Iterator.GetImage throws ArgumentException: Pix handle must not be zero  - [Issue 206](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/issues/206)\n* Support for ChoiceIterator -

Add the ``Tesseract`` NuGet Package by running ``Install-Package Tesseract`` from the [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console).\n2. (Optional) Add the ``Tesseract.Drawing`` NuGet package to support interop with ``System.Drawing`` in .NET Core, for instance to allow passing Bitmap to Tesseract\n3. Ensure you have Visual Studio 2019 x86 & x64 runtimes installed (see note above).\n4. Download language data files for tesseract 4.00 from the [tessdata repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast) and add them to your project, \n   ensure 'Copy to output directory' is set to Always.\n5. Check out the Samples solution ``~/src/Tesseract.Samples.sln`` in the [tesseract-samples](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract-samples) repository for a working example.\n\nIf you run into any issues please check out [this](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/wiki/Errors) wiki page which details a number common issues and some potential solutions.\n\n## Support\n\nPlease only file issues for bugs. \n\nIf you have any questions or feature/improvement ideas please ask them on our [forum](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract/discussions).\n\n## Note for contributors\n\nPlease create your pull requests to target the \"Master\" branch.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2012-2022 Charles Weld.\n\nLicensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0][apache2] (the \"License\"); you\nmay not use this software except in compliance with the License.
