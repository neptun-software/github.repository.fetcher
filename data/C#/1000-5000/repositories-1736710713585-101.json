Currently enrolled learners, if any, can: \n- Use the upgraded code in the [Unity_2020_3](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/tree/Unity_2020_3) or [Unity_2019_4](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/tree/Unity_2019_4) branches as suitable per your local Unity version compatibility. Credits: [PR#134](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/pull/134) and  [PR#133](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/pull/133) respectively. \n\n\n- Utilize the https://knowledge.udacity.com/ forum to seek help *only* on content-specific issues.\n\n\n- [Submit a support ticket](https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if (learners are) blocked due to other (non-content) reasons.\n\n\n\n## Welcome to Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator \n\nThis simulator was built for [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/drive), to teach students how to train cars how to navigate road courses using deep learning. See more [project details here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3).\n\nAll the assets in this repository require Unity. Please follow the instructions below for the full setup.\n\n### Available Game Builds (Precompiled builds of the simulator)\n\n#### Term 1\n\nInstructions: Download the zip file, extract it and run the executable file.\n\nVersion 2, 2/07/17\n\n[Linux](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/Term1-Sim/term1-simulator-linux.zip)\n[Mac](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/Term1-Sim/term1-simulator-mac.zip)\n[Windows](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/Term1-Sim/term1-simulator-windows.zip)\n\nVersion 1, 12/09/16\n\n[Linux](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5831f0f7_simulator-linux/simulator-linux.zip)\n[Mac](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5831f290_simulator-macos/simulator-macos.zip)\n[Windows 32](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5831f4b6_simulator-windows-32/simulator-windows-32.zip)\n[Windows 64](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5831f3a4_simulator-windows-64/simulator-windows-64.zip)\n\n#### Term 2\n\nPlease see the [Releases](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) page for the latest version of the Term 2 simulator (v1.45, 6/14/17).\n\nSource code can be obtained therein or also on the [term2_collection branch](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/tree/term2_collection).\n\n#### Term 3\n\nPlease see the [Releases](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) page for the latest version of the Term 3 simulator (v1.2, 7/11/17).\n\nSource code can be obtained therein or also on the [term3_collection branch](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/tree/term3_collection).\n\n#### System Integration / Capstone\n\nPlease see the [CarND-Capstone Releases](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases) page for the latest version of the Capstone simulator (v1.3, 12/7/17).\n\nSource code can be obtained therein.\n\n### Unity Simulator User Instructions\n\n1. Clone the repository to your local directory, please make sure to use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) to properly pull over large texture and model assets. \n\n2. Install the free game making engine [Unity](https://unity3d.com), if you dont already have it. Unity is necessary to load all the assets.\n\n3. Load Unity, Pick load exiting project and choice the `self-driving-car-sim` folder.\n\n4. Load up scenes by going to Project tab in the bottom left, and navigating to the folder Assets/1_SelfDrivingCar/Scenes. To load up one of the scenes, for example the Lake Track, double click the file LakeTrackTraining.unity. Once the scene is loaded up you can fly around it in the scene viewing window by holding mouse right click to turn, and mouse scroll to zoom.\n\n5. Play a scene. Jump into game mode anytime by simply clicking the top play button arrow right above the viewing window.\n\n6. View Scripts. Scripts are what make all the different mechanics of the simulator work and they are located in two different directories, the first is Assets/1_SelfDrivingCar/Scripts which mostly relate to the UI and socket connections. The second directory for scripts is Assets/Standard Assets/Vehicle/Car/Scripts and they control all the different interactions with the car.\n\n7. Building a new track. You can easily build a new track by using the prebuilt road prefabs located in Assets/RoadKit/Prefabs click and drag the road prefab pieces onto the editor, you can snap road pieces together easily by using vertex snapping by holding down \"v\" and dragging a road piece close to another piece.\n\n![Self-Driving Car Simulator](./sim_image.png)\n"

We plan to address this in a future release. This appears to be associated with not being connected to uWebSockets. If this does occur, please make sure you are conneted to uWebSockets. The following workaround may also be effective at preventing large log files.  For linux users, log file behavior can be adjusted through the Unity editor via ```player settings```.  The strategy below has proven effective for some students, with non-Linux OS.\n  + create an empty log file\n  + remove write permissions so that the simulator can't write to log\n\n- **Locale Issue:**  Some students have reported term 2 simulator issues related to non-US locale settings.  We plan to address this in a future release.  More information can be found [here](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/datasets-seem-to-be-missing-in-simulator-v1-45-ubuntu-16-04/373597/23?u=subodh.malgonde) and [here](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/term-2-simulator-not-working-properly/446386/5?u=subodh.malgonde).  The following workarounds have been succesful.\n  -  **Workaround 1:**\n    + ```sudo locale-gen \"en_US.UTF-8\"```\n    + ```sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales``` Choose en-us\n    + Restart\n- **Workaround 2:**\n  + Change Regional Formats (Ubuntu: Language Support -> Regional Formats)\n  + Select English (US)\n  + Restart\n"
