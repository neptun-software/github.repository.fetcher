All I got were links to paid solutions on the Unity3d's Assets Store and a lot of different and complicated tutorials.\n\nAt the end, I decided that there should be a simpler way and I created **SQLite4Unity3d**, a plugin that helps you to use SQLite in your Unity3d projects in a clear and easy way and works in **iOS, Mac, Android and Windows** projects.\n\nIt uses the great [sqlite-net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) library as a base so you will have **Linq besides sql**. For a further reference on what possibilities you have available with this library I encourage you to visit [its github repository](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net). \n\n*Note: _SQLite4Unity3d uses only the synchronous part of sqlite-net, so all the calls to the database are synchronous._\n\nIf you want to know more about why I created this plugin you can read more [here](http://www.codecoding.com/sqlite4unity3d-using-sqlite-net-library-and-unity3d-free-edition/).\n\n# The fast track\nAll you have to do to start using it in your project:\n\n1. [Download this zip](https://github.com/codecoding/SQLite4Unity3d/raw/master/SQLite4Unity3d.zip), extract its content and  **copy the resulting folder to your Assets/Plugins folder**. It contains the dlls that Unity3d will need to access sqlite.\n2. **Copy the SQLite.cs** file into your scripts folder.\n3. Don’t forget to **copy your SQLite database file in your Assets/StreamingAssets folder if you’re shipping one**.\n4. **You’re done!** Now you can get access to your database using sqlite-net.  ;P\n\n# Example\nIf you want to try it I've uploaded a small example that you will be able to find in the \"Example\" folder. Download the folder and open it with Unity3d to give it a try. It contains classes that will help you to start.\n\n## Android particularities\nAndroid configuration and deployment is very straight forward. Take a look at the **following video** if you want to get a picture on how to proceed:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=oPEl0mzeYoQ\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/oPEl0mzeYoQ/0.jpg\" alt=\"UWP\"  border=\"10\" /></a>\n\n# iOS particularities\nAs you may know **iOS doesn't allow JIT compilation** so, generally speaking, you will have to be very careful when you use **reflection** in your code. For a more deeper explanation of this issue please refer to Google but making it short: you cannot create dynamic objects using reflection. How is this affecting SQLite4Unity3d? Well, prior to this version you couldn't use very complicated queries. Now, **for basic queries you will have iOS support**. In case you stumble uppon a JIT compilation error it's time to use the old sql syntax.\n\nCheck this video to know how to proceed with iOS deployment:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=a4HXlGbO_2c\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/a4HXlGbO_2c/0.jpg\" alt=\"UWP\"  border=\"10\" /></a>\n\n# Windows particularities\nIn general you won't find any issues with Android and iOS. For **Windows versions**, please take a look at the **the video below** for more details on how to proceed:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=zVXr70fYxoA\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/zVXr70fYxoA/0.jpg\" alt=\"UWP\"  border=\"10\" /></a>\n\n# Acknowledgements\nThis project is based on the work of:\n\n- [Sqlite-net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) - License: custom - see https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net/blob/master/license.md\n\n\n"
