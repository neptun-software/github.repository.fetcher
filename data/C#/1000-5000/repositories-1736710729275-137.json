Active settings are marked with the status \"Configured\" and indicates that your privacy is protected. The inactive ones are declared as \"Not configured\". All available settings (currently 60) can be enabled as well as disabled.\n\n### System Requirements\n\n- Windows 10 (supports 1809 - 2009)\n\n## Download\n\n- (GitHub) [Download](https://github.com/builtbybel/privatezilla/releases)\n\n## Community package\n### For advanced users only!\n\nThe community package for Privatezilla adds support for several advanced scripting features based upon PowerShell, e.g.\n- Removal of specific pre-installed apps\n- Uninstall of OneDrive \n- Unping Startmenu tiles \n- Disable telemetry of third-party apps (E.g.
