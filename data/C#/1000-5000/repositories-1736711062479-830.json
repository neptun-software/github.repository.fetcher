          "content": "# Code of Conduct\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nA primary goal of Forge Networking Remastered is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\n\nWe invite all those who participate in Forge Networking Remastered to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.\n\n## 2. Open Source Citizenship\n\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\n\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\n\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.\n\n## 3. Expected Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n\n*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\n*   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\n*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.\n*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\n*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n*   Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\n## 4. Unacceptable Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:\n\n*   Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.\n*   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.\n*   Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n*   Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.\n*   Inappropriate photography or recording.\n*   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.\n*   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\n*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\n*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\n*   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.\n\n## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\n\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n\n## 6. Reporting Guidelines\n\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. support@beardedmangames.com.\n\n[Reporting Guidelines](https://github.com/BeardedManStudios/ForgeNetworkingRemastered/blob/master/reporting-guidelines.md)\n\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n\n## 7. Addressing Grievances\n\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Bearded Man Studios, Inc. with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.\n\n[Policy](https://github.com/BeardedManStudios/ForgeNetworkingRemastered/blob/master/community-policy.md)\n\n## 8. Scope\n\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\n\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n\n## 9.

          "content": "# Contributing\n:heart::+1: **Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute!** :+1::heart:\n\n## Code standards\nWe have a worldwide community and respect everyones backgrounds and languages, however Forge Networking is primarily developed by English (US) speakers. Because of this the variables, names, functions, comments, and everything else for this code base should be exclusively in English (US).\n\n### .editorconfig\nWe use .editorconfig to help with conforming to our coding conventions. Please make sure your chosen editor has this enabled. Check [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org/#download) to see if you need to install a plugin or your IDE has this built in.\n\n**Anything not listed here should follow the [C# standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines)**\n\n### Tabs vs spaces?\nSorry space fans, we are tabs. Though I know that this is an age old argument in computer science, we had to go with one or the other.\n\n### Accessors\nYes, we are aware that if you do not provide an accessor that it will default to `private`. However, we like knowing that others are doing what they do on purpose. For this reason you are required to put `private` in front of your private members.\n\nMember fields are to be camel case starting with an alpha character. For the most part people don't write C# in notepad so do not worry about any prefixes with underscores, or special things like `b_` or any of that\n```csharp\npublic int myNumber;\nprotected bool canHas;\nprivate string catName;\n```\n\nMember properties are to be pascal case starting with an alpha character. Also their brackets are to be on 1 line if the behavior is simple. Otherwise you are to use the hanging brackets coding standards\n```csharp\npublic int MyNumber { get; private set; }\npublic bool CanHas { get { return MyNumber > 0; } }\nprivate string CatName\n{\n    get\n    {\n        if (MyNumber > 5)\n            return \"Pickles\";\n        else if (CanHas)\n            return \"Sure\";\n        else\n            return \"George?\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Brackets\nFor single line conditional statements we do not have any brackets, just the line. Preferrably we put the code on the line following the if statement but for simple things like a return a single line is acceptable\n```csharp\nif (1 == 1)\n    DoSomethingFancy();\n```\n\nFor multiple line conditional statements we put \"hanging brackets\" only\"\n```csharp\nif (1 == 1)\n{\n    FirstThing();\n    LastThing();\n}\n```\n\nFor infinite loops, while loops, and do-while loops, we need these to be exceptionally clear. So in the case of any of these we will use hanging brackets.\n```csharp\nwhile (true)\n{\n    DoSomethingFancy();\n}\n\ndo\n{\n    DoSomethingFancy();\n} while(true);\n\nfor(;;)\n{\n    DoSomethingFancy();\n}\n```\n\nFor lambda expressions we have hanging brackets\n```csharp\nCall(() =>\n{\n    InnerCode();\n});\n```\n\nFor initializer lists we have hanging brackets (no parenthisis needed)\n```csharp\nMyClass thing = new MyClass\n{\n    a = 1,\n    b = 2,\n    c = 3\n};\n```\n\n### Comments\nSingle line comments should include a space after the slashes\n```csharp\n// Notice the space after the two slashes\n```\n\nCommenting out code should not include a space after the slashes\n```csharp\n//noSpace.Code();\n```\n\nTODO comments should include the space after the slashes and then 2 spaces after the colon following the `TODO`\n```csharp\n// TODO:  Notice the space after the slashes and the 2 spaces after the colon of todo\n```\n\n### Line length\nWe try to keep our line lengths short, try to stick around 90 characters maximum in the horizontal space and do not go any further than 120 characters. Or goals are to prevent any kind of horizontal scrolling or automatic line wrapping.\n\n### Var vs type name\nThough we accept code with `var` being used, it is hard to code review things listed as just `var` especially if they are the result of a function. If you are creating a new instance of something you can use `var` since the type name is in the line of declariation, otherwise please try to type the explicit type of the variable when it is the result of a function.\n\n### Function length\nWe prefer very small, descriptive functions over long monolythic functions. Try to keep your functions to something around 4-9 lines. If your functions are longer than 9 lines, it probably is a good chance for breaking it into smaller local private methods or turning what is being processed into a `class` and handling the logic more inside of there. This is not only for code clarity and readability, but also it makes it much easier to debug knowing the names of functons and produces clear stack traces.\n\n### Testing and TDD\nWe are currently trying out the Unity unit testing tools and they look promising so far. My hope is that we will be able to fall more into the TDD ([test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)) flow of programming so that we have many tests for the code to make sure it continues to work as expected for all of the functionality. Of course, I know it is very difficult to unit test a multi-threaded, network based application, but it is important for us to try as much as possible to achieve a full test coverage of the system.\n\nPlease make sure that you either create a new file in the [ForgeUnity/Assets/BeardedManStudios/Scripts/Editor/Tests](https://github.com/BeardedManStudios/ForgeNetworkingRemastered/tree/develop/ForgeUnity/Assets/BeardedManStudios/Scripts/Editor/Tests) folder. Or if you are adding new tests that are either missing or covering new functionality of a class, feel free to update existing tests.\n"

Since then, I did what any programmer does, re-wrote it 2 more times (Remastered and Alloy). Alloy is the best version, hands down, but as you may know; I've not been active. Since those days of old I've gotten married, had a child, moved 3 jobs, and spend most of my time in C writing systems code. Also since those days, bugs have not been fixed and pull requests have gone stale. If you care about the \"where are they now\" sgement, you can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FarrisFaulds), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/FarrisFaulds/), and our [website](https://farrisfaulds.com/).\n\n\nJust because I myself am not actively working on the code anymore does not mean that the code all the sudden can't work. It also doesn't mean that Forge is dead, open source means it's kept alive and well by the community.\n\nPlease, join the [community lead fork of Forge here](https://github.com/ForgeAlloyCommunity/ForgeAlloy) (be sure to read the wiki on there), and thank you to [@Daneeh](https://github.com/daneehAI) and @[Zaddo](https://github.com/zaddo67) for keeping it going. Please help by contributing to that repository! If not, there are always hundreds of forks to choose from.\n\nAlso thank you [@NFMynster](https://github.com/NFMynster), just in general; you've been awesome!\n\nYou can continue to [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/99mfUAH) as well!\n\nhttps://github.com/ForgeAlloyCommunity/ForgeAlloy\n\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ezLjujn.png)\n\n\n\nIn short, Forge Networking is a free and open source multiplayer game (multi-user) networking system that has a very good integration with the Unity game engine. You wanna make a multiplayer game or real time multi-user application? This is the library for you.\n\nWelcome to the most innovative networking solution (which works with the Unity game engine). Forge's network bandwidth is unbeatable, its performance outclasses other solutions, its flexibility is in a league of its own, and, as always, it has no CCU limits whatsoever. Forge Networking is an open source networking solution built in C#. It is completely multi-threaded and was designed to work both inside and outside of the Unity Game Engine but mainly in conjunction with Unity. To get started, check out the links listed below in this readme.\n\n## Possibilities\n- Unity multiplayer games/applications\n- Unity independent applications\n- User hosted servers\n- Run servers on Windows, OSX, Raspberry Pi, and/or Linux\n- Developer hosted servers\n- MMO, RTS, FPS, MOBA, you name it, Forge does it\n- Master Servers, NAT Hole punching, Web Servers, Cache servers, all the servers!\n- Server to server communication, yup\n- Spin up servers on demand, check\n- Tons of other stuff that I won't list otherwise I will go on forever, yes indeed\n\nIf you can name it, Forge most likely can do it :), it is built on some basic principles which makes any idea a possibility.\n\n## TLDR\nForge Networking is a networking solution built with the Unity game engine in mind. However, this is actually the 2nd version of Forge so it has some interesting properties. The first original Forge (classic) was built directly inside of Unity and was very tightly integrated with Unity. Once we learned everything we could from that version we opened up a blank Visual Studio project and began work on Forge Networking Remastered. Forge Networking Remastered was completely developed independently of Unity, it was tested and debugged in a C# project. Once it was working, we added Unity integration. This means that you can easily create native C# applications which run on Forge to support your games and applications such as Relay servers, NAT hole punching servers, chat servers, master servers, cache servers, websocket servers, you name it! Forge was developed in a way that makes it easy for you to serialize data in any way that you want. This allows you to make your project as secure as you want or as fast as you need.\n\n[Original Unity Forum Thread](https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/no-ccu-limit-forge-networking-superpowered-fully-cross-platform.286900/)\n\n## Getting Started\nUse the links below to learn how to create your first project with Forge Remastered, and be sure to join our active Discord server to talk with other Forge users.\n\n[Official Documentation](https://github.com/BeardedManStudios/ForgeNetworkingRemastered/wiki)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/yzZwEYm) - Join us and the growing community, for talking about Forge Networking as well as just networking in general. Even if you don't exactly use Forge Networking in your project you can get a ton of insight from this community :)\n\n[YouTube Jumpstart Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm1w78-UUlMIi5Vfwy6ckJQIQMHMT-QS5)\n\n## Ways to support the project\n- Make pull requests :D\n- Contribute to tutorials, documentation, and in the Discord community\n- [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/BrentFarris)\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
