See [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).\n\nIf a related discussion or issue doesn't exist, and the issue is not security related, you can [open a new issue](../../issues/new/choose). An issue can be converted into a discussion if regarded as one.\n\n### Contribute to the code\n\nFor substantial, non-trivial contributions, you may be asked to sign a contributor assignment agreement. Optionally, you can also have your name and contact information listed in [Contributors](https://www.bouncycastle.org/contributors.html). \n\nPlease note we are unable to accept contributions which cannot be released under the [Bouncy Castle License](https://www.bouncycastle.org/licence.html). Issuing a pull request on our public github mirror is taken as agreement to issuing under the Bouncy Castle License.\n\n#### Create a pull request\n\n> **_NOTE:_**  If the issue is a __potential security problem__, please contact us. See [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).\n\nYou are welcome to send patches, under the Bouncy Castle License, as pull requests. For more information, see [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). For minor updates, you can instead choose to create an issue with short snippets of code. See above.\n\n* For contributions touching multiple files try and split up the pull request, smaller changes are easier to review and test, as well as being less likely to run into merge issues.\n* Create a test cases for your change, it may be a simple addition to an existing test. If you do not know how to do this, ask us and we will help you. \n* If you run into any merge issues, check out this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Bouncy Castle documentation on [Getting Started with Bouncy Castle](https://doc.primekey.com/bouncycastle/introduction#Introduction-GettingStartedwithBouncyCastle).\n\n#### Self-review\n\nDon't forget to self-review. Please follow these simple guidelines:\n* Keep the patch limited, only change the parts related to your patch. \n* Do not change other lines, such as whitespace, adding line breaks to Java doc, etc. It will make it very hard for us to review the patch.\n\n\n#### Your pull request is merged\n\nFor acceptance, pull requests need to meet specific quality criteria, including tests for anything substantial. Someone on the Bouncy Castle core team will review the pull request when there is time, and let you know if something is missing or suggest improvements. If it is a useful and generic feature it will be integrated in Bouncy Castle to be available in a later release.\n"

It was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered Australian Charity, with a little help! The Legion, and the latest goings on with this package, can be found at [https://www.bouncycastle.org](https://www.bouncycastle.org).\n\nIn addition to providing basic cryptography algorithms, the package also provides support for CMS, OpenPGP, (D)TLS, TSP, X.509 certificate generation and more. The package also includes implementations of the following NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization algorithms: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, CRYSTALS-Kyber, Falcon, SPHINCS+, Classic McEliece, FrodoKEM, NTRU, NTRU Prime, Picnic, Saber, BIKE, and SIKE. These should all be considered EXPERIMENTAL and subject to change or removal. SIKE in particular is already slated for removal and should be used for research purposes only.\n\nThe Legion also gratefully acknowledges the contributions made to this package by others (see [here](https://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/contributors.html) for the current list). If you would like to contribute to our efforts please feel free to get in touch with us or visit our [donations page](https://www.bouncycastle.org/donate), sponsor some specific work, or purchase a [support contract](https://www.keyfactor.com/platform/bouncy-castle-support/).\n\nExcept where otherwise stated, this software is distributed under a license based on the MIT X Consortium license.

To subscribe use the links below and include the word subscribe in the message body. (To unsubscribe, replace **subscribe** with **unsubscribe** in the message body)\n\n*   [announce-crypto-csharp-request@bouncycastle.org](mailto:announce-crypto-csharp-request@bouncycastle.org)  \n    This mailing list is for new release announcements only, general subscribers cannot post to it.\n*   [dev-crypto-csharp-request@bouncycastle.org](mailto:dev-crypto-csharp-request@bouncycastle.org)  \n    This mailing list is for discussion of development of the package. This includes bugs, comments, requests for enhancements, questions about use or operation.\n\n**NOTE:** You need to be subscribed to send mail to the above mailing list.\n\n## Feedback \n\nIf you want to provide feedback directly to the members of **The Legion** then please use [feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org](mailto:feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org). If you want to help this project survive please consider [donating](https://www.bouncycastle.org/donate).\n\nFor bug reporting/requests you can report issues on [github](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp), or via [feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org](mailto:feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org) if required.
