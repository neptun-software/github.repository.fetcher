Just check it's not already submitted.\r\nIf you think it's not worth submitting, but it's relevant — submit anyway.\r\nCosmetic bugs are still bugs, impossible ideas might be possible.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nCode contributions are very welcome — but please read these notes:\r\n\r\n1. It's always recommended to find or submit an issue first, and comment that you want to do it.\r\nThis is especially important if you want to implement new feature.\r\nYour effort might be lost if it's already in progress, or if there is a disagreement about approach, etc.\r\n\r\n2. I have very specific opinions about UI design, code structure, patterns, features, etc.\r\nI might adjust or rewrite the code your submitted to match these ideas.\r\nThis doesn't mean your code was wrong — my changes are often very subjective.\r\n\r\n3. At the moment, there is no CLA (Contributor License Agreement), however I do intend to have one.\r\nThe idea is to keep a full ownership over SharpLab and be able to change license in the future.\r\nPlease keep this in mind if you dislike a possibility of a license change or, for example, paid features.\r\n\r\n#### Getting started\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n1. Install [node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (with npm package manager)\r\n2. Install [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)\r\n\r\nBuilding:\r\n1. After you cloned the repo, run `sl setup` to do initial project setup.\r\n2. If tests fail on `NullReferenceException` in `OptionsService`, just rerun them (Roslyn issue, looking into it).\r\n3. Code style is in `.editorconfig` — you should get 4-space indents and K&R braces automatically.\r\n4. If you run into an issue with build/tests/etc -- please report it on GitHub."

          "content": "This repository contains source code for https://sharplab.io.\r\n\r\nSharpLab is a .NET code playground that shows intermediate steps and results of code compilation.\r\nSome language features are thin wrappers on top of other features -- e.g. `using()` becomes `try/finally`.\r\nSharpLab allows you to see the code as compiler sees it, and get a better understanding of .NET languages.\r\n\r\nRecent versions include experimental support for running code, with some limitations.\r\n\r\n### Languages\r\n\r\nSharpLab supports three source languages:\r\n\r\n1. C#\r\n2. Visual Basic\r\n3. F#\r\n\r\nDue to complexity of F#'s compiler library, some features might not be available for F#.\r\n\r\n### Decompilation/Disassembly\r\n\r\nThere are currently three targets for decompilation/disassembly:\r\n\r\n1. C#\r\n2. IL\r\n3. JIT Asm (Native Asm Code)\r\n\r\nNote that VB=>C# disassembly shouldn't be used to convert between languages, as the produced code is intentionally overly verbose.\r\n\r\n### Execution\r\n\r\nYou can use \"Run\" target to execute your code and see the output.  \r\nExecution enables a few nice features such as flow arrows — see here:  \r\nhttps://twitter.com/ashmind/status/894058159223955456.\r\n\r\nExecution is intentionally limited, however the limits are continuously improved and corrected.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n"
