This provides all necessary game assets such as textures, 3D models, and sound effects.\n\nYou can get a free copy of DOS Daggerfall from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812390/The_Elder_Scrolls_II_Daggerfall/) and a free copy of Daggerfall Unity from the [Releases](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/releases) page. Then simply unzip the latest version of Daggerfall Unity to its own folder and point it to the DOS version. Daggerfall Unity will take care of everything else.\n\nHere are a couple of links with more detailed steps to help you get started using either Steam or a cross-platform process.\n\n+ [Using Steam Release of Daggerfall with Daggerfall Unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/wiki/Using-Steam-Release-of-Daggerfall-with-Daggerfall-Unity)\n+ [Installing Daggerfall Unity Cross Platform](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/wiki/Installing-Daggerfall-Unity-Cross-Platform)\n\n# System Requirements\n\nDaggerfall Unity has the following system requirements.

It's impossible to feature them all, but here's a sampling of a few popular mods that represent a variety of mods the community has created. They range from graphical overhauls, to new quests, new guilds, adding new world areas, and changing game formulas and other behaviours.\n\n## DREAM\n\n![image](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/assets/10426244/6a424f3c-f7f1-4def-82e9-98b6486dfc21)\n\nThe Daggerfall Remaster Enchanted Art Mod (DREAM) upgrades game assets including sound, music, videos & all graphics found in the game. It goes beyond a restoration and additionally fixes the old quirks, bugs and increases variety/fidelity everywhere possible.\n\n[Link to DREAM on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/5)\n\n## Quest Pack 1\n\n![image](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/assets/10426244/43688bd8-c3b0-42b5-bb64-066d6867ff66)\n\nThis quest pack offers 195 original new quests for Daggerfall Unity, mostly for the game's guilds.\n\n[Link to Quest Pack 1 on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/2)\n\n## Archaeologists\n\n![image](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/assets/10426244/282aa3a9-1662-49d9-9319-a9358775ea33)\n\nEnhance Daggerfall Unity gameplay by making language skills more viable and adding a new guild to the game, called \"The Archaeologists Guild\". Their mission is to delve into the history of Tamriel and they're interested in all creatures and races who have lived or still live there. Joining gives access to locator devices to aid in dungeon delving.\n\n[Link to Archaeologists on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/14)\n\n## World of Daggerfall Project\n\n![image](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/assets/10426244/c3909d99-9ce4-4c41-8aaf-ee7dce49a6d7)\n\nFrom the ashes of Daggerfall's past, experience the world of Daggerfall as originally envisioned. With glorious mountain tops that reach for the heavens, and countless new locations to explore.\n\n[Link to World of Daggerfall Project on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/249)\n\n## Finding My Religion\n\n![image](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/assets/10426244/995ae53d-eb99-451f-942c-931dd31dc85c)\n\nFinding My Religion is a multi-release visual and gameplay overhaul of Daggerfall's religions. The current release is \"Detailed Temples\", which decorates and redesigns the temples' according to the worshipped deity's sphere of influence. Julianos boasts a bigger library than others, Kynareth has an indoor garden, Mara has a birthing room and more. Each temple have been expanded downwards,  with priests' quarters and additional rooms for all service members. They also feature a crypt where people of importance have been buried.\n\n[Link to Finding My Religion on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/344)\n\n## Physical Combat And Armor Overhaul\n\n![image](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/assets/10426244/35bc2fb2-5b3d-401d-b3cb-806a59241014)\n\nInstead of increasing chance to avoid an attack completely, armor now reduces the damage you take, based on the material as well as the type of attack. Skills now determine most of your chance to avoid attacks, including many more features.\n\n[Link to Physical Combat And Armor Overhaul on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/76)\n\n## Links\n\n+ [Daggerfall Unity Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity) - *Discover more mods for Daggerfall Unity*\n+ [Lysandus' Tomb Discord](https://discord.gg/rn95kxPGpg) - *Join an active growing community*\n+ [Daggerfall Workshop](http://www.dfworkshop.net/) - *Follow the development of Daggerfall Unity*\n+ [Workshop Forums](http://forums.dfworkshop.net/) - *Join the forum community*\n+ [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/daggerfallunity) - *Join the Daggerfall Unity subreddit*\n+ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gav_clayton) - *Follow lead developer on Twitter for more news*\n"
