This package is fully customizable with its own Character Controller, being really easy to configure and fast to use. It has the possibility to choose between some already build-in Parkour Actions.\n\n|   Actions                 | Features                    |\n|         ---------         |         ----------          |\n| Vault Fence               | Custom Character Controller |\n| Vault Box                 | IK System                   |\n| Vault Down                | Vaulting System             |\n| Slide                     | Climbing System             |\n| Auto Step                 | Jump Prediction System      |\n| Climb Obstacles           | Motion  Warping             |\n| Jump to Poles             |                             |\n| Climb Ledges              |                             |\n| Jump Ledge to Ledge       |                             |\n| Drop to Ledges            |                             |\n| Braced and Hang Climbing  |                             |\n\n## Dependencies\nTo make the Dynamic Parkour System work, it requires the importation of Cinemachine and Input System Packets located in Unity Packet Manager.\n\n## Gameplay Demo\n[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/mw6ozapAuYY)\n\n## Controls\n\n|                           |   Keyboard & Mouse    | GamePad                           |\n|    ---------              |         ---------     |         ----------                |\n|   Movement                | W, A, S, D            | Left Joystick                     |\n|   Look Around             | Move Mouse            | Right Joystick                    |\n|   Run (Hold)              | Left Shift            | Right Trigger                     |\n|   Jump and Climb          | Space Bar             | X(Playstation) or A(Xbox) button  |\n|   Drop and Slide          | C                     | O(PlayStation) or B(Xbox) button  |\n\n\n## Download\n[Dynamic Parkour System Github Repository](https://github.com/knela96/Dynamic-Parkour-System)\n\n[Unity Package](https://github.com/knela96/Dynamic-Parkour-System/releases/latest)\n\n[Unity Build Demo](https://github.com/knela96/Dynamic-Parkour-System/releases/tag/v1.0-beta)\n\n[Documentation](https://github.com/knela96/Dynamic-Parkour-System/blob/Git-Pages/docs/Downloads/DynamicParkourSystem_Documentation.pdf)\n\n## Troubleshooting\nIf you have any problem or find any bug report it in the Official Repository inside [Issues](https://github.com/knela96/Dynamic-Parkour-System/issues) section\n\n## Contact Me\nWebsite: [ericcanela.com](https://ericcanela.com)\n\nTwitter: [@Knela96](https://twitter.com/knela96)\n\nBuyMeACoffee: [ericcaneladev](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ericcaneladev)\n\n## External Sources\nAnimations and Model from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/)\n"
