It is supported in Windows 8 and higher not lower. More instructions are written in their part in the application.\n\n---\n\n# Application improvement:\nApplying Windows 10 and 11 colors won't require a system logoff and logon, colors and preferences will be applied instantely, and fully applied after an explorer restart.\n\n---\n\n# Bugs fixes:\n\n- Fix WinPaletter Store showing areo lite scheme on preview when the theme is not using aero lite in Windows 11 and 10.\n- Fixed black rectangle that is shown instead of aero glass effect in tabs in Windows Vista and 7.\n- Icons and Visual Styles were not included in store items check, now they are fixed.\n- Changing metrics and fonts scheme from the schemes list disabled the aspect, now it is fixed.\n- Fix issue of loading Windows 11/10 colors with alpha channels equal 0 (completely transparent) while they should be opaque (255).\n- Fix exception error that might occur on opening WinPaletter (control or object is in use elsewhere). If it happens again, you can safely ignore this error.\n- Fix context menu of 9th color item in Windows 11/10 colors not opening.\n\n---\n\n> **Compare source code with:**\n\n| Version Type    | Version Code | Link                                                                                |\n|:---------------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| Previous Stable | `1.0.9.2`    | [Compare](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/compare/v1.0.9.2...v1.0.9.3) |\n| Previous Beta   | `1.0.8.9`    | [Compare](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/compare/v1.0.8.9...v1.0.9.3) |\n| Initial Release | `1.0.0.0`    | [Compare](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/compare/v1.0.0.0...v1.0.9.3) |\n\n---\n\n### 1.0.9.2\n\n> **Info:**\n\n| Channel  | Release Date |\n|:--------:|:------------:|\n| `Stable` | 12 Apr 2024  |\n\n# Critical update\nThis update is pushed to fix an exception error that occurs when changing the cursor size, when the source is a file and not rendered by WinPaletter #230.\n\n---\n\n> **Compare source code with:**\n\n| Version Type    | Version Code | Link                                                                                |\n|:---------------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| Previous Stable | `1.0.9.1`    | [Compare](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/compare/v1.0.9.1...v1.0.9.2) |\n| Previous Beta   | `1.0.8.9`    | [Compare](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/compare/v1.0.8.9...v1.0.9.2) |\n| Initial Release | `1.0.0.0`    | [Compare](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/compare/v1.0.0.0...v1.0.9.2) |\n\n---\n\n### 1.0.9.1\n\n> **Info:**\n\n| Channel  | Release Date |\n|:--------:|:------------:|\n| `Stable` | 11 Apr 2024  |\n\n# Critical update\nThis update is pushed to fix an exception error occured on substituting font Segoe UI and opening back WinPaletter.\n\n---\n\n# Application improvements:\n\n- Change cursors sizes as you like in Windows 10 and higher.\n\n---\n\n# Bugs fixes\n\n- Wrong wiki (help) URL for cursors is fixed.\n\n---\n\n> **Compare source code with:**\n\n| Version Type    | Version Code | Link                                                                                |\n|:---------------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| Previous Stable | `1.0.9.0`    | [Compare](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/compare/v1.0.9.0...v1.0.9.1) |\n| Previous Beta   | `1.0.8.9`    | [Compare](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/compare/v1.0.8.9...v1.0.9.1) |\n| Initial Release | `1.0.0.0`    | [Compare](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/compare/v1.0.0.0...v1.0.9.1) |\n\n---\n\n### 1.0.9.0\n\n> **Info:**\n\n| Channel  | Release Date |\n|:--------:|:------------:|\n| `Stable` | 01 Apr 2024  |\n\n## ð Announcement: Project Development Discontinuation:\n\nDear WinPaletter Users,\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I announce the discontinuation of further development on the WinPaletter project. While there's an extremely slim possibility that I may find time in the distant future, perhaps years from now, to resume maintenance, I must inform you that version `1.0.9.0` marks the end of active development. Subsequent versions (`1.0.9.x`) has extremely weak possibility to be developed.\n\nIn the coming days or weeks, I will proceed to archive this repository. However, please note that the existing version will remain accessible for continued use, albeit without updates or maintenance.\n\nYou can certainly contribute to the WinPaletter Store for themes; this repository won't be archived. [Open the Wiki](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/wiki) and navigate to the WinPaletter Store section in the side panel.\n\nI want to express my deepest gratitude for your support and for choosing WinPaletter. Your enthusiasm and feedback have been invaluable throughout this journey. It has been an immense honor for me to contribute to a project that aimed to enhance your user experience. If WinPaletter has caused any inconvenience or disruption to your Windows setup, I sincerely apologize.\n\n---\n\n## â ï¸ **Warning**\n### If you are using command lines, type `WinPaletter -?` in any terminal to know new commands formats\n\n## â¹ï¸ **Info**\n### This stable release is identical to the last 5 beta updates. If you have read them before, don't read this long changelog to save your time. If not, then you can read this changelog.\n\n---\n\n# New features:\n\n### 1. WinPaletter new look\n\n- In this release, WinPaletter boasts a revamped appearance with a massive UI refresh, including the introduction of a new tabbed navigation system for an organized and intuitive user experience. The addition of tabs enhances visual appeal and facilitates seamless task-switching. Embrace the improved visuals and navigation as I strive for a more user-friendly interface in every aspect of the application.\n\n### 2. Windows Visual Styles\n- In this release, WinPaletter introduces a new feature that allows you to change Windows Visual Styles (part of #225).\n- This feature requires patching UxTheme.dll. There will be a guide available within its form to patch it, either by using SecureUxTheme from its [official releases in its repository (recommended)](https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme/releases) or by utilizing the SecureUxTheme setup wrapper provided by WinPaletter.\n\n### 3. Windows Icons\n\n- This new feature will allow you to modify desktop icons, certain explorer icons, control panel icons on the main page, and shell32.dll.\n- It won't patch system files; this process involves modifying the registry exclusively.\n\n### 4. Changes in all Windows aspects\n\n- Some aspects (Windows Colors, Classic Colors, Cursors, Metrics, Fonts, and Wallpaper) will have two modes: Advanced Mode and Simple Mode. This change aims to make modifying Windows easier for users who found WinPaletter complex to use #190.\n\n- All aspects will feature a toggle controller (including aspects that didn't have it before, such as Windows Colors and Classic Colors), allowing users to control all Windows aspects and disable aspects they do not wish to modify.\n\n- All aspects will now include a toolbar featuring a simplified button layout (instead of the old and condensed buttons). Additionally, a split button is introduced to provide more functions, such as importing schemes from Windows defaults or current preferences.\n\n### 5. Changes in Windows aspect; Windows Colors\n\n- Fixes in previewer and performance improvements.\n\n- Per-element modifier; click on an elements on the preview to change its color.\n\n- Windows 11/10 Accent Colors Generator: Modify the titlebar color, then click 'Generate Accent Colors from Active Titlebar Color' to make WinPaletter generate nine accent colors based on this selected color.\n\n- Palette Generator: Improved performance and bug fixes, featuring a trials panel that records previous attempts to generate a palette, making it easier for users to revisit and select a preferred trial.\n\n### 6. Changes in Windows aspect; Classic Colors\n\n- Per-element modifier; right click on an elements on the preview to change its color.\n\n- 3D and flat degrees modification in 3D objects improved.\n\n- Magnifier: Use it to view small details in the preview, such as shadow borders and dark shadow lines. This feature makes it easier to utilize the per-element modifier.\n\n- Schemes Gallery: Preview all Classic Colors schemes in a single form, aiding users in visualizing and selecting their preferred scheme.\n\n- Fullscreen Preview: Expand the preview to fullscreen for a better examination.\n\n- Resolved exception error when importing from visual styles designed for Windows versions newer than XP.\n\n### 7. Changes in Windows aspect; Metrics and Fonts\n\n- Per-element modifier: Click on an element in the preview to alter its font and drag-and-drop to adjust its sizes.\n\n- Resolved a visual bug related to applying fonts with high DPI settings, preventing issues such as small or large fonts and irregular icon sizes not aligned with the selected DPI (scaling) value #205.\n\n### 8. Changes in Windows aspect; Cursors Studio\n\n- Enhanced rendering of classic styles, introducing pixelation for a more accurate and similar appearance to classic Windows cursors.\n\n- Fixed: the center point animation of the hourglass in classic style.\n\n- â ï¸ Known issue: Higher DPI scaling will render classic cursors wrongly.\n\n### 9. Changes in Windows aspect; Windows Terminals and Consoles\n\n- The JSON read/write mechanism for the terminal has been upgraded to improve code readability for developers and enhance the structure of theme files to match terminal JSON precisely. \n\n- Fixed a bug in creating a new external terminal (incorrect registry key path).\n\n- Resolved issue where opening PowerShell for testing launches 'takeown' PowerShell executable instead of the intended PowerShell.\n\n### 10. Changes in Windows aspect; Others\n\n- LogonUI now supports preview for Windows 10 and 11.\n\n- Screen Saver: Lists installed screensavers on the system to assist users in selecting one.\n\n- Sounds: Added a 'Restore Defaults' button to facilitate the restoration of a sound entry.\n\n- Sounds: WinPaletter will no longer install System Events Sounds by default at application startup.

If you press 'Yes,' the application of these changes will continue, but please note that this may conflict with ExplorerPatcher settings. #217\n- Starting now, the inclusion of User Preference Mask (UPM) modification for all users from current theme will be disabled by default. Look at Settings > Theme applying behavior. #217\n### 13.

Themes backup and restore\n\n- WinPaletter now introduces a new feature that allows you to automatically backup your themes.\n- Backing up before applying themes is enabled by default in WinPaletter.\n- You can also back up upon application startup or when opening a theme file (these options are not enabled by default).\n- You can open theme backups from the toolbar on the home page (main form).\n- You can control the backup folder location and other settings in Settings > Themes Backup.\n\n### 10. Aspects control\n\n- WinPaletter now introduces a new feature that allows you to increase your control over Windows aspects. This will be helpful for users who don't want to change a Windows aspect they like (acts like a secure lock).\n- For example, a user edited Windows Colors to an accent they like and doesn't want it to change again with any theme. This user can enable this feature and uncheck Windows Colors to disable editing it in the future.\n- Another example is a user who likes their own Metrics and Fonts; using WinPaletter's store may override their preferences. This user can enable this feature and uncheck Metrics and Fonts to disable editing them in the future.\n- You can find this feature in Settings > Aspects control.\n\n### 11. WinPaletter Store for themes\n\n- Faster opening of the WinPaletter Store.\n- Memory cleanup for store items upon closing the Store has been fixed.\n\n---\n\n# Application improvements:\n\n1.

The mechanism for downloading data from the web has been improved, transitioning from WebClient to HTTPClient.\n5. Addressed increased memory usage during cursor rendering and after closing Wallpaper and LogonUI forms.\n6. Remove all registry residuals during uninstallation #196 #191.\n7. Enable the 'Colors history' feature within the 'Custom colors' section if the Windows Classic Colors picker is enabled in settings.\n8. Making Metrics and Fonts applies values to open windows in a separate thread as a trial to reduce hanging #209.\n\n---\n\n# Bugs fixes\n\n1. Resolved exception error with ITaskbar3 on Windows XP and Vista.\n2. Fixed exception errors occurring when applying cursors.\n3. Fixed error when applying Windows 8.1 lock screen background and Windows 7 LogonUI background.\n4. Fixed bug applying dark mode after opening WinPaletter Application Themer with light mode.\n5.

Theme File Blocks:\n\nNow the theme file that is saved by WinPaletter (.wpth) has 2 blocks for Windows 11/10 (before it was one block applied to both Windows 11/10), making it easier to design a theme presented in one file for both versions of Windows (To avoid conflict between colors applied between these Windows Versions) (Themes File of WinPaletter earlier than 1.0.6.9 can be loaded/saved too)\n\n---\n\n# Redesigns:\n\n- Applicationâs UI improved a lot, especially the light mode becomes better, with the ability to change WinPaletterâs Colors and Backgrounds (Theming WinPaletter itself).

While there's an extremely slim possibility that I may find time in the distant future, perhaps years from now, to resume maintenance, I must inform you that version `1.0.9.3` marks the end of active development. Subsequent versions (`1.0.9.x`) has extremely weak possibility to be developed.\n\nIn the coming days or weeks, I will proceed to archive this repository.
