          "content": "# Respawn\n\n![CI](https://github.com/jbogard/Respawn/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/respawn.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/respawn) \n[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/respawn.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/respawn)\n[![MyGet (dev)](https://img.shields.io/myget/respawn-ci/v/respawn.svg)](https://myget.org/gallery/respawn-ci)\n\nRespawn is a small utility to help in resetting test databases to a clean state. Instead of deleting data at the end of a test or rolling back a transaction, Respawn [resets the database back to a clean, empty state](http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2013/06/18/strategies-for-isolating-the-database-in-tests/) by intelligently deleting data from tables.\n\nTo use, create a `Respawner` and initialize with tables you want to skip, or schemas you want to keep/ignore:\n\n```csharp\nvar respawner = await Respawner.CreateAsync(connection, new RespawnerOptions\n{\n    TablesToIgnore = new Table[]\n    {\n        \"sysdiagrams\",\n        \"tblUser\",\n        \"tblObjectType\",\n        new Table(\"MyOtherSchema\", \"MyOtherTable\")\n    },\n    SchemasToExclude = new []\n    {\n        \"RoundhousE\"\n    }\n});\n```\nOr if you want to use a different database:\n```csharp\nvar respawner = await Respawner.CreateAsync(connection, new RespawnerOptions\n{\n    SchemasToInclude = new []\n    {\n        \"public\"\n    },\n    DbAdapter = DbAdapter.Postgres\n});\n```\n\nIn your tests, in the fixture setup, reset to a clean state:\n```csharp\nawait respawner.ResetAsync(\"MyConnectionStringName\");\n```\nor if you're using a database besides SQL Server, pass an open `DbConnection`:\n```csharp\nusing (var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(\"ConnectionString\"))\n{\n    await conn.OpenAsync();\n\n    await respawner.ResetAsync(conn);\n}\n```\n\n## How does it work?\nRespawn examines the SQL metadata intelligently to build a deterministic order of tables to delete based on foreign key relationships between tables. It navigates these relationships to build a DELETE script starting with the tables with no relationships and moving inwards until all tables are accounted for.\n\nOnce this in-order list of tables is created in the `CreateAsync` factory, the Respawner object keeps this list of tables privately so that the list of tables and the order is only calculated once.\n\nIn your tests, you Reset your database before each test run. If there are any tables/schemas that you don't want to be cleared out, include these in the configuration of your RespawnerOptions.\n\nIn benchmarks, a deterministic deletion of tables is faster than truncation, since truncation requires disabling or deleting foreign key constraints. Deletion results in easier test debugging/maintenance, as transaction rollbacks/post-test deletion still rely on that mechanism at the beginning of each test. If data comes in from another source, your test might fail. Respawning to a clean state assures you have a known starting point before each test.\n\n### Installing Respawn\n\nYou should install [Respawn with NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Respawn):\n\n    Install-Package Respawn\n\nOr via the .NET Core CLI:\n\n    dotnet add package Respawn\n\nThis command from Package Manager Console will download and install Respawn.\n\n### Local development\n\nTo install and run local dependencies needed for tests, (PostgreSQL and MySQL) install Docker for Windows and from the command line at the solution root run:\n\n```\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nThis will pull down the latest container images and run them. You can then run the local build/tests.\n"
