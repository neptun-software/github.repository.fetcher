Please note that for pull requests with more than 20 significant lines of code it's mandatory to sign the EPPlus CAA, for the pull request to be accepted. \t\nThis is not a complicated process. Just download the CAA form, sign it and mail it to github@epplussoftware.com. You only need to do this once either for you or your company. \n\nOur unit tests are still LGPL (as stated in the header of those code files). So the 20 lines are excluding unit tests.\n\n### Larger pull requests\nLarger pull requests are in general not likely to be accepted.\n\nIf you are considering to submit code that has significant impact on the EPPlus code base, please reach out to us first. You can do this by creating an issue in our issue tracker. \"Significant impact\" would include one of the following definitions:\n- The pull request implements completely new features of EPPlus.\n- The pull request contains changes in central parts of the software.\n- The pull request would change the current behaviour of EPPlus.\n\nIf you have identified such a requirement we need to have a solid understanding of the issue before being able to advice the best way forward.\n\nPlease see our [CAA](https://epplussoftware.com/legal/caa) for more information.  \nFor branch naming see [Branching-strategy-and-CI](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus/wiki/Branching-strategy-and-CI)\n"

If the LicenseContext is not set, EPPlus will throw a LicenseException (only in debug mode).\n\nThis is a simple configuration that can be set in a few alternative ways:\n\n### 1. Via code\n```csharp\n// If you are a commercial business and have\n// purchased commercial licenses use the static property\n// LicenseContext of the ExcelPackage class :\nExcelPackage.LicenseContext = LicenseContext.Commercial;\n\n// If you use EPPlus in a noncommercial context\n// according to the Polyform Noncommercial license:\nExcelPackage.LicenseContext = LicenseContext.NonCommercial;\n    \nusing(var package = new ExcelPackage(new FileInfo(\"MyWorkbook.xlsx\")))\n{\n\n}\n```\n### 2. Via appSettings.json\n```json\n{\n    {\n    \"EPPlus\": {\n        \"ExcelPackage\": {\n            \"LicenseContext\": \"Commercial\" //The license context used\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n### 3. Via app/web.config\n```xml\n<appSettings>\n    <!--The license context used-->\n    <add key=\"EPPlus:ExcelPackage.LicenseContext\" value=\"NonCommercial\" />\n</appSettings>\n```\n### 4. Set the environment variable 'EPPlusLicenseContext'\nThis might be the easiest way of configuring this. Just as above, set the variable to Commercial or NonCommercial depending on your usage.\n\n**Important!** The environment variable should be set at the user or process level.\n\n## New features in EPPlus 7\n* Calculation engine update to support array formulas. https://epplussoftware.com/en/Developers/EPPlus7\n\t* Support for calculating legacy / dynamic array formulas.\n\t* Support for intersect operator.\n\t* Support for implicit intersection.\n\t* Support for array parameters in functions.\n\t* Better support for using the colon operator with functions.\n\t* Better handling of circular references\n\t* 90 new functions\n\t* Faster optimized calculation engine with configurable expression caching.\n\t* Breaking changes: Updated calculation engine, See [Breaking Changes in EPPlus 7](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus/wiki/Breaking-Changes-in-EPPlus-7) for more information.\n\t* Conditional Formatting improvements\n\t* Improved performance, xml is now read and written on load and save.\n\t* Cross worksheet support formula support.\n\t* Extended styling options for color scales, data bars and icon sets.\n\n## Breaking Changes\nSee https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus/wiki/Breaking-Changes-in-EPPlus-7\n\n## Improved documentation\nEPPlus 7 has a new web sample site available here: (https://samples.epplussoftware.com/) ,  Source code is available here: [EPPlus.WebSamples](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus.WebSamples)\nThere is also a new sample project for four different docker images, [EPPlus.DockerSample](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus.DockerSample).  \nEPPlus also has two separate sample projects for [C#](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus.Samples.CSharp) and [Visual Basic](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus.Samples.VB/) respectively.  \nThere is also an updated [developer wiki](https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus/wiki). \nThe work with improving the documentation will continue, feedback is highly appreciated!\n"
