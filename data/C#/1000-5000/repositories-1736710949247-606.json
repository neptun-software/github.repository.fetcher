Each voxel in the scene is instantiated\nas an entity, and controlled by component systems. It also utilizes the **C#\nJob System**, the **Burst Compiler** and the **asynchronous raycast** to hit\nthe maximum efficiency of multi-core processors.\n\n[Entity Component System]: https://unity.com/ecs\n\nSystem requirements\n-------------------\n\n- Unity 2022 LTS\n"
