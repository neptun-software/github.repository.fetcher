Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          "content": "# Attack Surface Analyzer \r\nAttack Surface Analyzer is a [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/) developed open source security tool that analyzes the attack \r\nsurface of a target system and reports on potential security vulnerabilities introduced during\r\nthe installation of software or system misconfiguration. \r\n\r\n## Getting Attack Surface Analyzer\r\n[![CodeQL](https://github.com/microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml) [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Microsoft.CST.AttackSurfaceAnalyzer.CLI)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CST.AttackSurfaceAnalyzer.CLI) ![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.CST.AttackSurfaceAnalyzer.CLI)\r\n\r\nIf you have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed you can install Attack Surface Analyzer with `dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CST.AttackSurfaceAnalyzer.CLI`.\r\n\r\nPlatform specific binaries for Attack Surface Analyzer are distributed via our GitHub [releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/releases/latest) page.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies on Linux/Docker\r\nAttack Surface Analyzer is built on .NET so [.NET's linux dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/linux-packages.md) must be installed to run ASA.  Some linux distributions may not contain these packages by default.\r\n\r\nFor running Attack Surface Analyzer in Docker you should use the [.NET Docker Image Base](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-sdk/) or another image that has the .NET SDK installed, and then install the ASA tool from Nuget in your Dockerfile like `RUN dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CST.AttackSurfaceAnalyzer.CLI`\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/wiki/).\r\n\r\nDocumentation for the [API](https://microsoft.github.io/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/api/) is available on GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\n## New Features in 2.3\r\n\r\n- New Blazor GUI with Rule Authoring and Testing Sandbox\r\n- New Collectors\r\n- Improved collection and analysis performance.\r\n- Support for C# 10/.NET 6\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAttack Surface Analyzer 2 replaces the original Attack Surface Analyzer tool, released publicly in 2012.\r\n\r\nPotential users of Attack Surface Analyzer include:\r\n\r\n* DevOps Engineers - View changes to the system attack surface introduced when your software is installed.\r\n* IT Security Auditors - Evaluate risk presented by when third-party software is installed.\r\n\r\n## Core Features\r\n\r\nThe core feature of Attack Surface Analyzer is the ability to \"diff\" an operating system's security configuration, before and after a software component is installed and to run arbitrary complex rules on the results to surface interesting findings. This is important because most installation processes require elevated privileges, and once granted, can lead to unintended system configuration changes.\r\n\r\nAttack Surface Analyzer currently reports on changes to the following operating system components:\r\n\r\n- File system (static snapshot and live monitoring available)\r\n- User accounts\r\n- Services\r\n- Network Ports\r\n- Certificates\r\n- Registry\r\n- COM Objects\r\n- Event Logs\r\n- Firewall Settings\r\n- Wifi Networks\r\n- Cryptographic Keys\r\n- Processes\r\n- TPM Information\r\n\r\nAll data collected is stored in a set of local SQLite databases.\r\n\r\n## How to Use Attack Surface Analyzer\r\n\r\nRun the following commands in an Administrator Shell (or as root).  Replace ```asa``` with ```asa.exe``` as appropriate for your platform.\r\n\r\n### CLI Mode\r\nTo start a default all collectors run: ```asa collect -a```\r\n\r\nTo compare the last two collection runs: ```asa export-collect```\r\n\r\nFor other commands run: ```asa --help```\r\n\r\n### GUI Mode\r\nFor the GUI interface run: ```asa gui``` and a browser window should open directed at ```http://localhost:5000``` with the web based interface.\r\n\r\nDetailed information on how to use Attack Surface Analyzer can be found on our\r\n[wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nTo build Attack Surface Analyzer, see [BUILD](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/blob/main/BUILD.md).\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\nThe latest public version of Attack Surface Analyzer with public builds is 2.3 (see [Release\\v2.3](https://github.com/Microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer/tree/release/v2.3)).  \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
