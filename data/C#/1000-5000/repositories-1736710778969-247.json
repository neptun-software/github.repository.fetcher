          "content": "# Architecture\n\nThis document describes the design of csharprepl at a high level. It's useful if you want to contribute to csharprepl and are trying to understand how the code is organized and what the various responsibilities are.\n\nBroadly, there are three main components to csharprepl's architecture:\n\n1. [Roslyn libraries](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) - Written by Microsoft, these provide both high-level and low-level APIs for building, running, and analyzing C# code.\n1. [PrettyPrompt library](https://github.com/waf/PrettyPrompt) - the PrettyPrompt library was written alongside csharprepl, and is packaged as a separate nuget package and repository. It's a Console.ReadLine replacement, and handles terminal features like accepting input, drawing autocompletion menus, syntax highlighting, keybindings, etc, and generally handles the \"user experience\" of the prompt. It's a general library, and does not know anything about C#; it instead provides callbacks that csharprepl implements to add C#-specific behavior.\n1. csharprepl (this repository) - This application uses PrettyPrompt to collect input from the user, invokes the Roslyn APIs on that input, and then prints the result.\n\nEach of the above parts is described in more detail below.\n\n## Roslyn libraries\n\ncsharprepl uses two main areas of the Roslyn libraries:\n\n- C# Scripting API ([docs](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/b796152aff3a7f872bd70db26cc9f568bbdb14cc/docs/wiki/Scripting-API-Samples.md))\n- C# Workspaces API ([docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/work-with-workspace))\n\nThe C# Scripting API allows for evaluating strings containing C# and returns the result. This is the core of the REPL experience; this core is quite simple, and a basic REPL could be implemented in a couple of lines of C# using this API. In csharprepl, this is in `ScriptRunner.cs`.\n\nThe C# Workspaces API provides all the ancillary editor features in csharprepl, like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, documentation tooltip information, etc. A workspace is conceptually similar to a Visual Studio solution, and it has multiple projects all contained in memory. Each line of a REPL is implemented as a single project with a single document, and each project has a reference to the previously submitted project. In other words, the workspace is a linked-list of projects, where each project is a line of the REPL. Submitting a new line in csharprepl will create a new project and document. Features like syntax highlighting and autocompletion read this document as their input.\n\nThese two APIs are quite separate; one of the main tasks of csharprepl is to ensure that when code is evaluated in the REPL, both of these APIs receive consistent information (see `RoslynServices.cs`).\n\n## PrettyPrompt library\n\nThis prompt library is initialized/called in the main `Program.cs`, in the \"Read\" part of the \"Read-Eval-Print-Loop.\" It's instantiated with callback functions to handle syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and more; these callbacks invoke the above `RoslynServices.cs` class to fulfill the callbacks. The `PromptAdapter` class maps between Roslyn concepts (e.g. a span of text with the syntax classification) and the PrettyPrompt concepts (e.g. a span of text with a syntax highlight color).\n\n## csharprepl\n\nAs previously described, csharprepl serves as an intermediary between the above two libraries. There are four main tasks that csharprepl performs:\n\n- `Program.cs` handles basic features like command line arguments, help documentation, and the core read-eval-print-loop.\n- Initialization logic is managed in `RoslynServices.cs`. The Roslyn libraries do a lot of heavy lifting and are relatively slow to initialize; RoslynServices serves as an entry point to all Roslyn services, and it manages this initialization in the background to keep csharprepl snappy. It ensures that when the Roslyn services are called, they either don't block, or they wait for initialization to complete if required.\n    - You can see this in action by starting csharprepl and typing some C# code really quickly before initialization can fully complete. You'll be able to type without delay as it won't block, but you might see syntax highlighting kick in a few seconds later, after initialization is complete; this is what RoslynServices is managing.\n- Synchronization between the C# Scripting API and C# Workspaces API, as described in *Roslyn libraries* above, is also managed by `RoslynServices.cs`. Upon successful evaluation of a script, it updates the workspaces API with a new project and updates the active document to use for syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and more.\n- Assembly reference management - Management of [Shared Frameworks](https://natemcmaster.com/blog/2017/12/21/netcore-primitives/), [implementation vs reference assemblies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/reference-assemblies), and adding references dynamically are handled in the `AssemblyReferenceService.cs`. This class is called by our MetadataReferenceResolver implementation, which is an extension point provided by Roslyn.\n    - This MetadataReferenceResolver is responsible for evaluating `#r` statements, and delegates for assembly references, nuget package installation, csproj/sln references, and shared framework loading. The implementation is in `CompositeMetadataReferenceResolver.cs`\n"

However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2.

Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\nsuch modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\nLicenses\n\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\nSecondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\nnotice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n-------------------------------------------\n\n  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n  License, v. 2.0.

It supports intellisense, installing NuGet packages, and referencing local .NET projects and assemblies.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waf/CSharpRepl/main/.github/readme_assets/csharprepl.mp4\">\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waf/CSharpRepl/main/.github/readme_assets/csharprepl.png\" alt=\"C# REPL screenshot\" style=\"max-width:80%;\">\n  </a>\n  <p align=\"center\"><i>(click to view animation)</i></p>\n</div>\n\nC# REPL provides the following features:\n\n- Syntax highlighting via ANSI escape sequences\n- Intellisense with documentation and overload navigation\n- Automatic formatting of typed input\n- Nuget package installation\n- Reference local assemblies, solutions, and projects\n- Dump and explore objects with syntax highlighting and rich Spectre.Console formatting\n- OpenAI integration (bring your own API key)\n- Navigate to source via Source Link\n- IL disassembly (both Debug and Release mode)\n- Fast and flicker-free rendering. A \"diff\" algorithm is used to only render what's changed.\n\n## Installation\n\nC# REPL is a .NET 9 global tool, and runs on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. It can be installed [from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CSharpRepl) via:\n\n```console\ndotnet tool install -g csharprepl\n```\n\nIf you're running on Mac OS Catalina (10.15) or later, make sure you follow any additional directions printed to the screen. You may need to update your PATH variable in order to use .NET global tools.\n\nAfter installation is complete, run `csharprepl` to begin. C# REPL can be updated via `dotnet tool update -g csharprepl`.\n\n## Themes and Colors\n\nThe default theme uses the same colors as Visual Studio dark mode, and custom themes can be created using a [`theme.json`](https://github.com/waf/CSharpRepl/blob/main/CSharpRepl/themes/dracula.json) file. Additionally, your terminal's colors can be used by supplying the `--useTerminalPaletteTheme` command line option. To completely disable colors, set the NO_COLOR environment variable.\n\n## Usage\n\nType some C# into the prompt and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run it. The result, if any, will be printed:\n\n```csharp\n> Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\")\nHello World\n\n> DateTime.Now.AddDays(8)\n[6/7/2021 5:13:00 PM]\n```\n\nTo evaluate multiple lines of code, use <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd> to insert a newline:\n\n```csharp\n> var x = 5;\n  var y = 8;\n  x * y\n40\n```\n\nAdditionally, if the statement is not a \"complete statement\" a newline will automatically be inserted when <kbd>Enter</kbd> is pressed. For example, in the below code, the first line is not a syntactically complete statement, so when we press enter we'll go down to a new line:\n\n```csharp\n> if (x == 5)\n  | // caret position, after we press Enter on Line 1\n```\n\nFinally, pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> will show a \"detailed view\" of the result. For example, for the `DateTime.Now` expression below, on the first line we pressed <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and on the second line we pressed <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> to view more detailed output:\n\n```csharp\n> DateTime.Now // Pressing Enter shows a reasonable representation\n[5/30/2021 5:13:00 PM]\n\n> DateTime.Now // Pressing Ctrl+Enter shows a detailed representation\n[5/30/2021 5:13:00 PM] {\n  Date: [5/30/2021 12:00:00 AM],\n  Day: 30,\n  DayOfWeek: Sunday,\n  DayOfYear: 150,\n  Hour: 17,\n  InternalKind: 9223372036854775808,\n  InternalTicks: 637579915804530992,\n  Kind: Local,\n  Millisecond: 453,\n  Minute: 13,\n  Month: 5,\n  Second: 0,\n  Ticks: 637579915804530992,\n  TimeOfDay: [17:13:00.4530992],\n  Year: 2021,\n  _dateData: 9860951952659306800\n}\n```\n\n**A note on semicolons**: C# expressions do not require semicolons, but [statements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19132/expression-versus-statement) do. If a statement is missing a required semicolon, a newline will be added instead of trying to run the syntatically incomplete statement; simply type the semicolon to complete the statement.\n\n```csharp\n> var now = DateTime.Now; // assignment statement, semicolon required\n\n> DateTime.Now.AddDays(8) // expression, we don't need a semicolon\n[6/7/2021 5:03:05 PM]\n```\n\nWhen you're done with your session, you can type `exit` or press <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> to exit.\n\n## Adding References\n\nUse the `#r` command to add assembly or nuget references.\n\n- For assembly references, run `#r \"AssemblyName\"` or `#r \"path/to/assembly.dll\"`\n- For project references, run `#r \"path/to/project.csproj\"`. Solution files (.sln) can also be referenced.\n- For nuget references, run `#r \"nuget: PackageName\"` to install the latest version of a package, or `#r \"nuget: PackageName, 13.0.5\"` to install a specific version (13.0.5 in this case).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waf/CSharpRepl/main/.github/readme_assets/nuget.png\" alt=\"Installing nuget packages\" style=\"max-width:80%;\">\n</p>\n\nTo run ASP.NET applications inside the REPL, start the `csharprepl ` application with the `--framework` parameter, specifying the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` shared framework. Then, use the above `#r` command to reference the application DLL. See [Configuring CSharpRepl](https://github.com/waf/CSharpRepl/wiki/Configuring-CSharpRepl) for more details.\n\n```console\ncsharprepl --framework  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\n```\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nCSharpRepl aims for a similar editing experience as Visual Studio (e.g. for text navigation, selection and keyboard shortcuts).\n\n- **Basic Usage**\n  - <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> - Cancel current line\n  - <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> or type `exit` - Exit the REPL\n  - <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd> - Clear screen\n  - <kbd>Enter</kbd> - Evaluate the current line if it's a syntactically complete statement; otherwise add a newline\n  - <kbd>Control+Enter</kbd> - Evaluate the current line, and return a more detailed representation of the result\n  - <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd> - Insert a new line (this does not currently work on Linux or Mac OS; Hopefully this will work in .NET 7)\n  - <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd> - Copy current line to clipboard\n  - <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd>, <kbd>Shift+Insert</kbd>, and <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd> - Paste text to prompt. Automatically trims leading indent\n- **Code Actions**\n  - <kbd>F1</kbd> - Opens the MSDN documentation for the class/method under the caret ([example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/api/System.DateTime.AddDays?view=net-5.0))\n  - <kbd>F9</kbd> - Shows the IL (intermediate language) for the current statement in Debug mode. \n  - <kbd>Ctrl+F9</kbd> - Shows the IL for the current statement with Release mode optimizations.\n  - <kbd>F12</kbd> - Opens the source code in the browser for the class/method under the caret, if the assembly supports [Source Link](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink).\n- **Autocompletion**\n  - <kbd>Ctrl+Space</kbd> - Open the autocomplete menu.\n  - <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Tab</kbd> - Select the active autocompletion option\n  - <kbd>Escape</kbd> - Closes the autocomplete menu\n\n## Command Line Configuration\n\nThe C# REPL supports both command line options as well as a configuration file. See the [Configuring CSharpRepl](https://github.com/waf/CSharpRepl/wiki/Configuring-CSharpRepl) wiki page for more information.\n\nRun `csharprepl --help` to see the available command line configuration options, and run `csharprepl --configure` to get started with the configuration file.\n\nIf you have [`dotnet-suggest`](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/blob/main/docs/dotnet-suggest.md) enabled, all options can be tab-completed, including values provided to `--framework` and .NET namespaces provided to `--using`.\n\n## Integrating with other software\n\nC# REPL is a standalone software application, but it can be useful to integrate it with other developer tools:\n\n### Windows Terminal\n\nTo add C# REPL as a menu entry in Windows Terminal, add the following profile to Windows Terminal's `settings.json` configuration file (under the JSON property `profiles.list`):\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"C# REPL\",\n    \"commandline\": \"csharprepl\"\n},\n```\n\nTo get the exact colors shown in the screenshots in this README, install the [Windows Terminal Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/windows-terminal).\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n\nTo use the C# REPL with Visual Studio Code, simply run the `csharprepl` command in the Visual Studio Code terminal. To send commands to the REPL, use the built-in `Terminal: Run Selected Text In Active Terminal` command from the Command Palette (`workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText`).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waf/CSharpRepl/main/.github/readme_assets/vscode.png\" alt=\"Visual Studio Code screenshot\" style=\"max-width:90%;\">\n</p>\n\n\n### Windows OS\n\nTo add the C# REPL to the Windows Start Menu for quick access, you can run the following PowerShell command, which will start C# REPL in Windows Terminal:\n\n```powershell\n$shell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell\n$shortcut = $shell.CreateShortcut(\"$env:appdata\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\csharprepl.lnk\")\n$shortcut.TargetPath = \"wt.exe\"\n$shortcut.Arguments = \"-w 0 nt csharprepl.exe\"\n$shortcut.Save()\n```\n\nYou may also wish to add a shorter alias for C# REPL, which can be done by creating a `.cmd` file somewhere on your path. For example, put the following contents in `C:\\Users\\username\\.dotnet\\tools\\csr.cmd`:\n\n```shell\nwt -w 0 nt csharprepl\n```\n\nThis will allow you to launch C# REPL by running `csr` from anywhere that accepts Windows commands, like the Window Run dialog.\n\n### Linux terminal)\n\nYou may wish to add a shorter alias for C# REPL, which can be done by adding the following to your `~/.bashrc`:\n\n```shell\nalias cs=csharprepl\n```\n\n## Comparison with other REPLs\n\nThis project is far from being the first REPL for C#. Here are some other projects; if this project doesn't suit you, another one might!\n\n**Visual Studio's C# Interactive pane** is full-featured (it has syntax highlighting and intellisense) and is part of Visual Studio. This deep integration with Visual Studio is both a benefit from a workflow perspective, and a drawback as it's not cross-platform. The C# Interactive pane supports navigating to source code (default F12), which will open that source in the containing Visual Studio window, yet no NuGet packages. It starts in .NET Framework mode but also supports .NET Core via `#reset core`. Subjectively, it does not follow typical command line keybindings, so can feel a bit foreign.\n\n**csi.exe** ships with C# and is a command line REPL. It's great because it's a cross platform REPL that comes out of the box, but it doesn't support syntax highlighting, autocompletion, or .NET Core.\n\n**[dotnet script](https://github.com/dotnet-script/dotnet-script)** allows you to run C# scripts from the command line. It has a REPL built-in, but the predominant focus seems to be as a script runner. It's a great tool, though, and has a strong community following.\n\n**[dotnet interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive)** is a tool from Microsoft that creates a Jupyter notebook for C#, runnable through Visual Studio Code. It also provides a general framework useful for running REPLs.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThanks for the interest!
