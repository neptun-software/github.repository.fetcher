Definitions\r\n      The terms \"reproduce,\" \"reproduction,\" \"derivative works,\" and \"distribution\" have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law. A \"contribution\" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software. A \"contributor\" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license. \"Licensed patents\" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution.\r\n   2. Grant of Rights\r\n      (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create.\r\n      (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.\r\n   3. Conditions and Limitations\r\n      (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.\r\n      (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.\r\n      (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.\r\n      (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.\r\n      (E) The software is licensed \"as-is.\" You bear the risk of using it. The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n4.

Great! Here are a few guidelines.\n\n1. If you want to do a feature, post an issue about the feature first. Some features are intentionally left out, some features may already be in the works, or I may have some advice on how I think it should be done. I would feel bad if time was spent on some code that won't be used.\n2. If you want to do a bug fix, it might not be a bad idea to post about it too. I've had the same bug fixed by multiple people at the same time before.\n3. All code should have a unit test. If you make a feature, there should be significant tests around the feature. If you do a bug fix, there should be a test specific to that bug so it doesn't happen again.\n4. Pull requests should have a single commit. If you have multiple commits, squash them into a single commit before requesting a pull.\n5. Try and follow the code styling already in place. If you have ReSharper there is a dotsettings file included and things should automatically be formatted for you.\n\n## Credits\n\n### Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
