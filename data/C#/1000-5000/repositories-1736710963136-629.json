          "content": "# Contributing to PdfPig #\n\nWelcome and thanks for your interest in PdfPig.\n\nWe're always looking for contributions which improve the stability of PdfPig and add missing features.\n\nThere are many ways you can get involved, from raising issues, writing or improving documentation and writing code.\n\n## Getting Started ##\n\nPdfPig is a C# .NET project. For this reason development is easiest on Windows.\n\nTo get started simply clone the code, you will need Git on your system to do this. [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) can be downloaded and installed easily. Once you have Git on your system you can get the code by cloning:\n\n```git clone https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig.git```\n\n### Windows ###\n\nOnce you have the code you can build it using Visual Studio. Visual Studio comes with a community edition which is free to use - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/. Because PdfPig support multiple versions of the .NET framework you will need multiple versions installed to build it, alternatively see the other \"Linux and Mac\" section:\n\n+ Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 SDK\n+ Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6 SDK\n+ Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 SDK\n+ Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7 SDK\n+ Microsoft .NET Core SDK >= 2.1.0\n\n### Linux and Mac ###\n\n*The guide below is untested*.\n\nBecause one of the Target Frameworks for PdfPig is .NET Standard 2.0 it may be possible to build and develop it on non-Windows systems.\n\nFirst you will need a .NET Core development environment set up. You will need the .NET Core 2.0 SDK.\n\n+ For Linux - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x\n+ For Mac - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/macos-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x\n\nOnce you have a `dotnet` environment set up you should be able to run `dotnet --version` from a terminal to see the installed version.\n\n#### Before Building ####\n\nThe project supports some target frameworks which aren't supported on Linux or Mac. You can remove these from the Project files to support building on non-Windows systems.\n\nOpen `.\\src\\UglyToad.PdfPig\\UglyToad.PdfPig.csproj` in a text editor and change:\n\n```\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net45;net451;net452;net46;net461;net462;net47;net6.0</TargetFrameworks>\n    <PackageId>PdfPig</PackageId>\n    ...\n```\n\nTo:\n\n```\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0</TargetFrameworks>\n    <PackageId>PdfPig</PackageId>\n```\n**Please do not commit this change when submitting a PR**.\n\n#### Build ####\n\nWith a terminal inside the `src` folder you can run `dotnet restore` followed by `dotnet build` to build the project.\n\n#### Development Environment ####\n\nYou can use the tool of your choice to develop on non-Windows environments (or even on Windows!) by invoking the dotnet build tools from the command line.\n\nFor intellisense and refactoring support you can use Visual Studio for Mac on Mac systems and Visual Studio Code on all systems. See this guide for Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/dotnet.\n\n## Developing ##\n\nThe PdfPig code is split into 2 logical sections, reading and writing PDF files. The entry point for [all reading related activities is](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig/blob/master/src/UglyToad.PdfPig/PdfDocument.cs):\n\n```.\\src\\UglyToad.PdfPig\\PdfDocument.cs```\n\nAll calls from here are passed through to the `PdfDocumentFactory` which serves as the composition root for parsing a PDF file.\n\nA bird's eye view of the process of parsing is:\n\n1. Parse the file header to make sure we're dealing with a PDF file.\n2. Find the cross-reference (xref) table or stream at the end of the document which indicates the location of all numbered PDF objects in the file.\n3. Parse the trailer dictionary which contains the location of the pages tree, information dictionary, any encryption material, etc.\n4. Return a new `PdfDocument` containing the objects and information necessary to load and parse all other parts of the document.\n\nConsult the full PDF specification for further information, I use [the Sixth Edition](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference_archive/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) but there are newer specifications [available](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf). PDF 2.0 is defined in an ISO document which is unfortunately not available for free so PDF 2.0 features are not implemented in general.\n\n### Architecture and Style ###\n\nIn general the aim is for objects to be immutable and avoid state as much as possible. Prefer `IReadOnlyList<T>` and `get` only properties where possible. As far as possible services should not use state and should instead take data as method parameters.\n\nThe code base is still evolving towards an established design, meanwhile consult the existing code for examples of style, naming, etc.\n\n## Issues ##\n\nIssue reports help us improve the software for all users and are very valuable. However it is extremely difficult to assist people if issue reports lack some key information. Please provide as far as possible:\n\n+ Documents that reproduce the issue being described.\n+ Full stack traces and inner exception details for any exceptions being encountered.\n+ Details on the system (OS, Framework Version, etc.) any errors are being encountered on.\n\nIt is most important to provide the document. If this is not possible due to data protection then we'll try our best to help, but it's unlikely we'll be able to fix the issue.\n\nIn addition issues can serve as a way to request features and ask questions about usage of the library.\n\nPlease remember no one is getting paid for this and try to be understanding if we can't help you."

In addition the library can be used to create simple PDF documents\ncontaining text and geometrical shapes.\n\nThis project aims to port [PDFBox](https://github.com/apache/pdfbox) to C#.\n\n**Migrating to 0.1.6 from 0.1.x?** Use this guide: [migration to 0.1.6](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig/wiki/Migration-to-0.1.6).\n\n## Wiki\nCheck out our [wiki](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig/wiki) for more examples and detailed guides on the API.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe package is available via the releases tab or from Nuget:\n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/PdfPig/\n\nOr from the package manager console:\n\n    > Install-Package PdfPig\n\nWhile the version is below 1.0.0 minor versions will change the public API without warning (SemVer will not be followed until 1.0.0 is reached).\n\n## Get Started\n\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig/wiki) for more examples \n\n### Read words in a page\nThe simplest usage at this stage is to open a document, reading the words from every page:\n\n```cs\nusing (PdfDocument document = PdfDocument.Open(@\"C:\\Documents\\document.pdf\"))\n{\n\tforeach (Page page in document.GetPages())\n\t{\n\t\tstring pageText = page.Text;\n\n\t\tforeach (Word word in page.GetWords())\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tConsole.WriteLine(word.Text);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nAn example of the output of this is shown below:\n\n![Image shows three words 'Write something in' in 2 sections, the top section is the normal PDF output, the bottom section is the same text with 3 word bounding boxes in pink and letter bounding boxes in blue-green](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UglyToad/Pdf/master/documentation/Letters/example-text-extraction.png)\n\nWhere for the PDF text (\"Write something in\") shown at the top the 3 words (in pink) are detected and each word contains the individual letters with glyph bounding boxes.\n\n### Ceate PDF Document\nTo create documents use the class `PdfDocumentBuilder`. The Standard 14 fonts provide a quick way to get started:\n\n```cs\nPdfDocumentBuilder builder = new PdfDocumentBuilder();\n\nPdfPageBuilder page = builder.AddPage(PageSize.A4);\n\n// Fonts must be registered with the document builder prior to use to prevent duplication.\nPdfDocumentBuilder.AddedFont font = builder.AddStandard14Font(Standard14Font.Helvetica);\n\npage.AddText(\"Hello World!\", 12, new PdfPoint(25, 700), font);\n\nbyte[] documentBytes = builder.Build();\n\nFile.WriteAllBytes(@\"C:\\git\\newPdf.pdf\", documentBytes);\n```\n\nThe output is a 1 page PDF document with the text \"Hello World!\" in Helvetica near the top of the page:\n\n![Image shows a PDF document in Google Chrome's PDF viewer. The text \"Hello World!\" is visible](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UglyToad/Pdf/master/documentation/builder-output.png)\n\nEach font must be registered with the PdfDocumentBuilder prior to use enable pages to share the font resources. Only Standard 14 fonts and TrueType fonts (.ttf) are supported.\n\n### Advanced Document Extraction\nIn this example a more advanced document extraction is performed. PdfDocumentBuilder is used to create a copy of the pdf with debug information (bounding boxes and reading order) added.\n\n\n```cs\n//using UglyToad.PdfPig;\n//using UglyToad.PdfPig.DocumentLayoutAnalysis.PageSegmenter;\n//using UglyToad.PdfPig.DocumentLayoutAnalysis.ReadingOrderDetector;\n//using UglyToad.PdfPig.DocumentLayoutAnalysis.WordExtractor;\n//using UglyToad.PdfPig.Fonts.Standard14Fonts;\n//using UglyToad.PdfPig.Writer;\n\n\nvar sourcePdfPath = \"\";\nvar outputPath = \"\";\nvar pageNumber = 1;\nusing (var document = PdfDocument.Open(sourcePdfPath))\n{\n    var builder = new PdfDocumentBuilder { };\n    PdfDocumentBuilder.AddedFont font = builder.AddStandard14Font(Standard14Font.Helvetica);\n    var pageBuilder = builder.AddPage(document, pageNumber);\n    pageBuilder.SetStrokeColor(0, 255, 0);\n    var page = document.GetPage(pageNumber);\n\n    var letters = page.Letters; // no preprocessing\n\n    // 1. Extract words\n    var wordExtractor = NearestNeighbourWordExtractor.Instance;\n\n    var words = wordExtractor.GetWords(letters);\n\n    // 2. Segment page\n    var pageSegmenter = DocstrumBoundingBoxes.Instance;\n\n    var textBlocks = pageSegmenter.GetBlocks(words);\n\n    // 3. Postprocessing\n    var readingOrder = UnsupervisedReadingOrderDetector.Instance;\n    var orderedTextBlocks = readingOrder.Get(textBlocks);\n\n    // 4. Add debug info - Bounding boxes and reading order\n    foreach (var block in orderedTextBlocks)\n    {\n        var bbox = block.BoundingBox;\n        pageBuilder.DrawRectangle(bbox.BottomLeft, bbox.Width, bbox.Height);\n        pageBuilder.AddText(block.ReadingOrder.ToString(), 8, bbox.TopLeft, font);\n    }\n\n    // 5. Write result to a file\n    byte[] fileBytes = builder.Build();\n    File.WriteAllBytes(outputPath, fileBytes); // save to file\n}\n```\n\n![Image shows a PDF document created by the above code block with the bounding boxes and reading order of the words displayed](/documentation/boundingBoxes_ReadingOrder.png)\n\nSee [Document Layout Analysis](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig/wiki/Document-Layout-Analysis) for more information on advanced document analysing.\n\nSee [Export](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig/wiki/Document-Layout-Analysis#export) for more advanced tooling to analyse document layouts.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### PdfDocument\n\nThe `PdfDocument` class provides access to the contents of a document loaded either from file or passed in as bytes. To open from a file use the `PdfDocument.Open` static method:\n\n```cs\nusing UglyToad.PdfPig;\nusing UglyToad.PdfPig.Content;\n\nusing (PdfDocument document = PdfDocument.Open(@\"C:\\my-file.pdf\"))\n{\n\tint pageCount = document.NumberOfPages;\n\n\t// Page number starts from 1, not 0.\n\tPage page = document.GetPage(1);\n\n\tdecimal widthInPoints = page.Width;\n\tdecimal heightInPoints = page.Height;\n\n\tstring text = page.Text;\n}\n```\n\n`PdfDocument` should only be used in a `using` statement since it implements `IDisposable` (unless the consumer disposes of it elsewhere).\n\nEncrypted documents can be opened by PdfPig. To provide an owner or user password provide the optional `ParsingOptions` when calling `Open` with the `Password` property defined. For example:\n\n    using (PdfDocument document = PdfDocument.Open(@\"C:\\my-file.pdf\",  new ParsingOptions { Password = \"password here\" }))\n\nYou can also provide a list of passwords to try:\n\n```cs\nusing (PdfDocument document = PdfDocument.Open(@\"C:\\file.pdf\", new ParsingOptions\n{\n\tPasswords = new List<string> { \"One\", \"Two\" }\n}))\n```\n\nThe document contains the version of the PDF specification it complies with, accessed by `document.Version`:\n\n    decimal version = document.Version;\n\n### Document Creation (0.0.5)\n\nThe `PdfDocumentBuilder` creates a new document with no pages or content.\n\nFor text content, a font must be registered with the builder. This library supports Standard 14 fonts provided by Adobe by default and TrueType format fonts.\n\nTo add a Standard 14 font use:\n\n    public AddedFont AddStandard14Font(Standard14Font type)\n\nOr for a TrueType font use:\n\n    AddedFont AddTrueTypeFont(IReadOnlyList<byte> fontFileBytes)\n\nPassing in the bytes of a TrueType file (.ttf). You can check the suitability of a TrueType file for embedding in a PDF document using:\n\n    bool CanUseTrueTypeFont(IReadOnlyList<byte> fontFileBytes, out IReadOnlyList<string> reasons)\n\nWhich provides a list of reasons why the font cannot be used if the check fails. You should check the license for a TrueType font prior to use, since the compressed font file is embedded in, and distributed with, the resultant document.\n\nThe `AddedFont` class represents a key to the font stored on the document builder. This must be provided when adding text content to pages. To add a page to a document use:\n\n    PdfPageBuilder AddPage(PageSize size, bool isPortrait = true)\n\nThis creates a new `PdfPageBuilder` with the specified size. The first added page is page number 1, then 2, then 3, etc. The page builder supports adding text, drawing lines and rectangles and measuring the size of text prior to drawing.\n\nTo draw lines and rectangles use the methods:\n\n```cs\nvoid DrawLine(PdfPoint from, PdfPoint to, decimal lineWidth = 1)\nvoid DrawRectangle(PdfPoint position, decimal width, decimal height, decimal lineWidth = 1)\n```\n\nThe line width can be varied and defaults to 1. Rectangles are unfilled and the fill color cannot be changed at present.\n\nTo write text to the page you must have a reference to an `AddedFont` from the methods on `PdfDocumentBuilder` as described above. You can then draw the text to the page using:\n\n    IReadOnlyList<Letter> AddText(string text, decimal fontSize, PdfPoint position, PdfDocumentBuilder.AddedFont font)\n\nWhere `position` is the baseline of the text to draw. Currently **only ASCII text is supported**. You can also measure the resulting size of text prior to drawing using the method:\n\n    IReadOnlyList<Letter> MeasureText(string text, decimal fontSize, PdfPoint position, PdfDocumentBuilder.AddedFont font)\n\nWhich does not change the state of the page, unlike `AddText`.\n\nChanging the RGB color of text, lines and rectangles is supported using:\n\n```cs\nvoid SetStrokeColor(byte r, byte g, byte b)\nvoid SetTextAndFillColor(byte r, byte g, byte b)\n```\n\nWhich take RGB values between 0 and 255. The color will remain active for all operations called after these methods until reset is called using:\n\n    void ResetColor()\n\nWhich resets the color for stroke, fill and text drawing to black.\n\n### Document Information\n\nThe `PdfDocument` provides access to the document metadata as `DocumentInformation` defined in the PDF file. These tend not to be provided therefore most of these entries will be `null`:\n\n```\nPdfDocument document = PdfDocument.Open(fileName);\n\n// The name of the program used to convert this document to PDF.\nstring producer = document.Information.Producer;\n\n// The title given to the document\nstring title = document.Information.Title;\n// etc...\n```\n\n### Document Structure (0.0.3)\n\nThe document now has a Structure member:\n\n    UglyToad.PdfPig.Structure structure = document.Structure;\n\nThis provides access to tokenized PDF document content:\n\n```cs\nCatalog catalog = structure.Catalog;\nDictionaryToken pagesDictionary = catalog.PagesDictionary;\n```\n\nThe pages dictionary is the root of the pages tree within a PDF document. The structure also exposes a `GetObject(IndirectReference reference)` method which allows random access to any object in the PDF as long as its identifier number is known. This is an identifier of the form `69 0 R` where 69 is the object number and 0 is the generation.\n\n### Page\n\nThe `Page` contains the page width and height in points as well as mapping to the `PageSize` enum:\n\n\n```cs\nPageSize size = Page.Size;\n\nbool isA4 = size == PageSize.A4;\n```\n\n`Page` provides access to the text of the page:\n\n    string text = page.Text;\n\nThere is a new (0.0.3) method which provides access to the words. This uses basic heuristics and is not reliable or well-tested:\n\n    IEnumerable<Word> words = page.GetWords();\n\nYou can also (0.0.6) access the raw operations used in the page's content stream for drawing graphics and content on the page:\n\n    IReadOnlyList<IGraphicsStateOperation> operations = page.Operations;\n\nConsult the PDF specification for the meaning of individual operators.\n\nThere is also an early access (0.0.3) API for retrieving the raw bytes of PDF image objects per page:\n\n    IEnumerable<XObjectImage> images = page.ExperimentalAccess.GetRawImages();\n\nThis API will be changed in future releases.\n\n### Letter\n\nDue to the way a PDF is structured internally the page text may not be a readable representation of the text as it appears in the document. Since PDF is a presentation format, text can be drawn in any order, not necessarily reading order. This means spaces may be missing or words may be in unexpected positions in the text.\n\nTo help users resolve actual text order on the page, the `Page` file provides access to a list of the letters:\n\n    IReadOnlyList<Letter> letters = page.Letters;\n\nThese letters contain:\n\n- The text of the letter: `letter.Value`.\n- The location of the lower left of the letter: `letter.Location`.\n- The width of the letter: `letter.Width`.\n- The font size in unscaled relative text units (these sizes are internal to the PDF and do not correspond to sizes in pixels, points or other units): `letter.FontSize`.\n- The name of the font used to render the letter if available: `letter.FontName`.\n- A rectangle which is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the visible region of the letter/glyph: `letter.GlyphRectangle`.\n- The points at the start and end of the baseline `StartBaseLine` and `EndBaseLine` which indicate if the letter is rotated. The `TextDirection` indicates if this is a commonly used rotation or a custom rotation.\n\nLetter position is measured in PDF coordinates where the origin is the lower left corner of the page. Therefore a higher Y value means closer to the top of the page.\n\n### Annotations (0.0.5)\n\nEarly support for retrieving annotations on each page is provided using the method:\n\n    page.ExperimentalAccess.GetAnnotations()\n\nThis call is not cached and the document must not have been disposed prior to use. The annotations API may change in future.\n\n### Bookmarks (0.0.10)\n\nThe bookmarks (outlines) of a document may be retrieved at the document level:\n\n    bool hasBookmarks = document.TryGetBookmarks(out Bookmarks bookmarks);\n\nThis will return `false` if the document does not define any bookmarks.\n\n### Forms (0.0.10)\n\nForm fields for interactive forms (AcroForms) can be retrieved using:\n\n    bool hasForm = document.TryGetForm(out AcroForm form);\n\nThis will return `false` if the document does not contain a form.\n\nThe fields can be accessed using the `AcroForm`'s `Fields` property. Since the form is defined at the document level this will return fields from all pages in the document. Fields are of the types defined by the enum `AcroFieldType`, for example `PushButton`, `Checkbox`, `Text`, etc.\n\nPlease note the forms are readonly and values cannot be changed or added using PdfPig.\n\n### Hyperlinks (0.1.0)\n\nA page has a method to extract hyperlinks (annotations of link type):\n\n    IReadOnlyList<UglyToad.PdfPig.Content.Hyperlink> hyperlinks = page.GetHyperlinks();\n\n### TrueType (0.1.0)\n\nThe classes used to work with TrueType fonts in the PDF file are now available for public consumption. Given an input file:\n\n\n```cs\nusing UglyToad.PdfPig.Fonts.TrueType;\nusing UglyToad.PdfPig.Fonts.TrueType.Parser;\n\nbyte[] fontBytes = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(@\"C:\\font.ttf\");\nTrueTypeDataBytes input = new TrueTypeDataBytes(fontBytes);\nTrueTypeFont font = TrueTypeFontParser.Parse(input);\n```\n\nThe parsed font can then be inspected.\n\n### Embedded Files (0.1.0)\n\nPDF files may contain other files entirely embedded inside them for document annotations. The list of embedded files and their byte content may be accessed:\n\n```cs\nif (document.Advanced.TryGetEmbeddedFiles(out IReadOnlyList<EmbeddedFile> files)\n    && files.Count > 0)\n{\n    var firstFile = files[0];\n    string name = firstFile.Name;\n    IReadOnlyList<byte> bytes = firstFile.Bytes;\n}\n```\n\n### Merging (0.1.2)\n\nYou can merge 2 or more existing PDF files using the `PdfMerger` class:\n\n```cs\nvar resultFileBytes = PdfMerger.Merge(filePath1, filePath2);\nFile.WriteAllBytes(@\"C:\\pdfs\\outputfilename.pdf\", resultFileBytes);\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\nIf you wish to generate doxygen documentation, run `doxygen doxygen-docs` and open `docs/doxygen/html/index.html`.\n\nSee also the [wiki](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig/wiki) for a detailed documentation on parts of the API\n\n## Issues\n\nPlease do file an issue if you encounter a bug.\n\nHowever in order for us to assist you, you **must** provide the file which causes your issue. Please host this in a publically available place.\n\n## Credit\n\nThis project wouldn't be possible without the work done by the [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) team and the Apache Foundation.\n"

This is a number used to access glyph descriptions.\n\nThe CMap maps between character codes and CID numbers for the glyphs.\n\nA CIDFont file provides the glyph descriptions for a character collection. The glyph descriptions are\nidentified by CIDs.\n\nCID keyed font combines a CMap with a CIDFont.\n\nThe **Encoding** contains the CMap.\nThe **DescendantFonts** contains the CIDFont to use with the CMap.\n\n### CIDFont ###\n\nA Type0 font descendant (CIDFont) must be either a CIDFontType0 (Adobe Type 1) or CIDFontType2 (TrueType).\n\nFor Type 2 CIDFonts (TrueType) the glyphs are identified by a glyph index (GID).\n\n+ If the font program is embedded as a stream the CIDFont dictionary must contain a CIDToGIDMap which maps\nfrom CIDs to Glyph Indexes.\n\n+ If the font program is a predefined external font the CIDFont must not contain a CIDToGIDMap. It\nmay only use a predefined CMap.\n\nThough a CID may not be used to select the glyph as in the predefined case, it is always used to select glyph\nmetrics. Every CIDFont must describe CID 0 which is the ```.notdef``` character for missing characters.\n\n### Glyph Metrics in CIDFonts ###\n\nWidths for CIDFonts are defined in the DW and W entries in the CIDFont dictionary.\n\n+ DW provides the default width for glyphs which are not specified individually.\n+ W defines widths for individual CIDs.\n\nVertical writing has other stuff, see the spec.\n\n### CMap ###\n\nThe CMap maps from character codes to character selectors (CIDs).\n\nThe CMap defines the writing mode horizontal or vertical.\n\n### Type 0 Fonts ###\n\nThe **Font dictionary** has the following entries:\n\n+ Type (name): /Font\n+ Subtype (name): /Type0\n+ BaseFont (name): The PostScript name of the font.\n+ Encoding (name/stream R): Name of a predefined CMap or a stream for an embedded CMap.\n+ DescendantFonts (array): Single element pointing to the CIDFont.\n+ ToUnicode (stream R)?: Stream containing a CMap file to map codes to Unicode.\n\n## Simple Fonts ##\n\n+ Glyphs are selected by single-byte character codes. Index into a 256 entry glyph table.\n+ Only supports horizontal writing mode.\n\n## Further Description ##\n\n### Type 1 Fonts ###\n\nThe **Font program** is a PostScript program describing glyph shape. See the Adobe Type 1 Font Format specification.\n\nThe **Font dictionary** has the following entries:\n\n+ Type (name): /Font\n+ Subtype (name): /Type1\n+ Name (name?): Font name\n+ BaseFont (name): The PostScript name of the font. Equivalent to the FontName value in the **Font program**.\n+ FirstChar (int): The first character code in the Widths array.\n+ LastChar (int) The last character code in the Widths array.\n+ Widths (numeric[] R): An array defining the glyph width in units of 1000 == 1 text space unit.\n+ FontDescriptor (Dict<> R): Describes font metrics other than widths.\n+ Encoding (name/Dict<> R): Specifies the character encoding if different from default.\n+ ToUnicode (stream R): CMap mapping character code to Unicode."
