Written in C#\nBased on Praetox's loic project at https://sourceforge.net/projects/loic/. \n\n================\n|| Help - dox ||\n================\n\nThere is now  an online help available. Press <F1>, read the .chm file or got in the source to the help/web folder and read there!\n\n================\n|| DISCLAIMER ||\n================\n\nI, NewEraCracker, am not responsible for the use that you give to this tool.\nYou cannot blame me if you use this tool to attack servers you don't own and get caught.\nThis tool is released for educational purposes only and comes with no warranty at all.\n\n===========================\n|| HOW TO RUN IN WINDOWS ||\n===========================\n\nGET THE BINARIES!\n\nRequires Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 available at\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=ab99342f-5d1a-413d-8319-81da479ab0d7&displaylang=en\n\n=========================\n|| HOW TO RUN IN LINUX ||\n=========================\n\nYou'll need mono and log4net:\n\n# sudo apt-get install mono liblog4net-cil-dev\n\nThen, build it:\n\n# mdtool build\n\nAnd run it!\n\n# bin/Debug/LOIC.exe\n\n==========================\n|| HIVEMIND/HIDDEN MODE ||\n==========================\n\nHIVE MIND mode will connect your client to an IRC server so it can be controlled\nremotely. Think of it like a voluntary botnet. They might even make your client\ndo naughty things, so beware.\n\nNote: It does NOT allow remote administration of your machine, or anything shit\nlike that, it is literally just control of loic itself.\n\nIf you want to start up in hivemind, run like this:\n LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address\nIt will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:6667/loic\n\nYou can also specify port and channel\n LOIC.exe /hivemind irc.server.address 1234 #secret\nIt will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:1234/secret\n\nIn order to do hivemind hidden run like this:\n LOIC.exe /hidden /hivemind irc.server.address\nIt will connect to irc://irc.server.adress:6667/loic without any visible GUI\n\n==============================\n|| CONTROLING LOIC FROM IRC ||\n==============================\n\nAs an OP, Admin or Owner set a channel topic or type message with (as an example):\n!lazor targetip=127.0.0.1 message=test_test port=80 method=tcp wait=false random=true\n\nTo start attack type\n!lazor start\n\nOr just append \"start\" in the END of the topic\n!lazor targetip=127.0.0.1 message=test_test port=80 method=tcp wait=false random=true start\n\nTo reset options back to default:\n!lazor default\n\nTo stop attack:\n!lazor stop\n\nAnd remove \"start\" from topic (if exists)\nYou can also replace \"start\" by \"stop\" in the END of the topic.\n\nTake a look at source for more details.\n\n==================================\n|| CONTROLING LOIC OVER THE WEB ||\n==================================\n\n>> Press <F10> for easy copy & paste of HiveMind / OverLord Settings <<\n\n\nThe OverLord-Mode is meant as a Fail-Save mechanism to allow easy (de)centralised control in exactly the same way as HiveMind does.\n\nThe information is encoded into hyperlinks and allows though an easy and secure distribution way. \n!!URL-Shortener and Redirectors are fully supported!!\n\n\n-SYNTAX-\nThere are 3 Methods:\n---\n\nI. Plain-Text Links: can ONLY specify TARGETS\n\"LOIC: {OL-URI}\"\n\n---\n\nII: a-href Links: \nII.a: Back-Up Mirrors - they contain no target information and point to sites, where target are posted.\n'class=\"LO bu\" href=\"{URI}\"' - read diretion top to bottom\n'class=\"LO bu r\" href=\"{URI}\"' - read direcion bottom to top\n\nthe read direction depends on the site: e.g. for twitter, where the newest post is on the top, you want to scan the site top-to-bottom for targets.\nOn Blogs / Boards where the newest posts are at the bottom, you want to scan in the reverse direction.\n\nIn the GUI the checkbox \"Up?\" scans top-to-bottom if checked and reverse otherwise.\n\nThe scan stops at the first encountered target and uses this as the current target - all BackUp Mirrors up to this point are stored. (mirrors after the 1st target in read-direction are ignored)\n\nII.b: Target-Links\n'class=\"LO tar\" href=\"{OL-URI}\"'\n\n---\n\nIII. Plain Text instruction (this is depreciated)\n\"[LOIC]\n{command}:{value}\n{command}:{value}\n...\n[/LOIC]\"\n\nif there is a \"lot\" of html-code merged into the text it is best to use the \"@\"-Delimeter:\n\"[LOIC]@{command}:{value}@<html goes here>@{command}:{value}@......[/LOIC]\"\n\n---------\n\nThe URI-Syntax for Targets:\n{OL-URI} = {URI}@{command}={value}@{single_sign}@{command}={value}@...\n\nIT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO USE URL-SHORTENER FOR THE TARGET-COMMANDS!!\n\n---\n\nCommands: THESE APPLY ONLY TO TARGET-LINKS as in method II.b or PLAINT Text as in method III!!!!!\n(there are 2 new commands - the others are the same as on IRC)\n\ntargetip, targethost, timeout, subsite, message, port, method, threads, wait, random, speed\n\nhivemind - let's you set an Hive-Mind-Server over OverLord: @hivemind=irc.cooldomin.heros:6667#hivemind@\nif this command is used the control is immediately transferred to the HiveMind! (aka: OverLord STOPS working!)\ntherefor the hivemind command is best used alone without other commands.\n\ntime - you can set a timer for the beginning of the fun: @time=YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm@ (time-zone is UTC for the time - the time-zone-correction is done by the client according to the system-settings and time!)\nif a time command is issued the current attack stops and the Lazor waits until the time is reached. the target-information is updated once again EXACTLY at the beginning of the attack.\n\nUsing this it is possible, to set a time for all \"connected\" lazors WITHOUT revealing the target:\n1. http://hive.mind/go.hp?@time=2010/05/23 15:00@\nat 14:55 (UTC) you just change the Link to: http://hive.mind/go.hp?@time=2010/05/23 15:00@&@targetip=127.0.0.1@\n\n-------------------\n\n... enough with the crap - a real world example:\nOn site http://main.com is the command center where you don't want to post target-information:\nput somewhere on your site (in a .php / .txt / .html / .js or whatever file you have) the Back-Up-Mirrors for your OP:\n\n<a class=\"LO bu\" href=\"http://somefree-hoster.com/url/yourbackup\">&nbsp</a>\n<a class=\"LO bu\" href=\"http://twitter.com/account\">&nbsp</a>\n<a class=\"LO bu r\" href=\"http://xyx.chan.com/b/1234\">&nbsp</a>\n<a class=\"LO bu\" href=\"http://bit.ly\">&nbsp</a>\n\nAs soon as one mirror fails the next is taken - the mirrors are accumulated at the client - so you can change them or add more atfer the majority of the nodes have read them once! .. Back-Up-Mirrors are only removed from the client, if one seems to be offline. (the effects of the Stress-Test on the client machine is (to some degree) mitigated!)\n\nit might be a good idea, to hide the \"LO\"-Class with a (inline-) CSS or put it into any hidden container ... or just leave as is :D\n\nATTENTION: Backup Mirrors + Targets in one Page!\nPay attention to the scan-direction! If you read top-to-bottom (Up? = checked in the GUI) you HAVE TO PUT your mirrors BEFORE the first target-link!\nif you scan reverse you have to put the mirrors BELOW the target!\n\ne.g. Scanning REVERSE + Mixed-Mode\n<html-code>\n<p>your very long paragraph LOIC: http://bit.ly/abcde your paragraph contniues on for ours</p>\n<more html>\n<a style=\"display:none\" class=\"LO bu\" href=\"http://bit.ly\">&nbsp</a>\n<footer-stuff>\n\nthat's pretty much it xD\n"
