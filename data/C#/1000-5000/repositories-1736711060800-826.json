An app, process, or even a module can freely mix and match with ARM64EC and x64 as needed. The ARM64EC code in the app will run natively while any x64 code will run using Windows 11 on ARM’s built-in emulation. The ARM64EC ABI differs slightly from the current [ARM64 ABI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/arm64-windows-abi-conventions?view=msvc-160) in ways that make it binary compatible with x64 code. Specifically, the ARM64EC ABI follows x64 software conventions including calling convention, stack usage, and data alignment, making ARM64EC and x64 interoperable. Apps built as ARM64EC may contain x64 code but do not have to, since ARM64EC is its own complete, first-class ABI for Windows.\n \n \n**NOTE:** Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chip will be available in mobile devices starting Mid-2024.\n\n[Snapdragon X Elite](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/10/qualcomm-unleashes-snapdragon-x-elite--the-ai-super-charged-plat) is its all-new custom CPU architecture, codenamed Oryon. The X Elite includes a total of **12 Oryon cores**, rather than a mix of large and small cores like Qualcomm has used in past designs. When all cores are active, they can run at peak speeds of up to **3.8 GHz**, though when just one or two cores are boosting they can go up to **4.3 GHz**.\n \n * Qualcomm says that the X Elite's Adreno GPU has upgradeable drivers, which means new capabilities can be added over time. it will support a **4K 120 Hz laptop display**, plus a total of **three 4K external displays (or two 5K external displays)**. The GPU supports the DirectX 12 graphics API—no Vulkan support, at least not yet—and Qualcomm says it will feature **upgradeable drivers**. Qualcomm compared the X Elite's GPU performance to both [Intel's Iris Xe](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/iris-xe.html) and [AMD's Radeon 780M](https://www.amd.com/en/products/apu/amd-ryzen-7-7840u). The Adreno GPU is reportedly up to 2x as fast as the Iris Xe and up to 80% faster than the Radeon 780M, while using about one-fifth as much power.\n \n * The chip also includes respectable media encoding and decoding capabilities, with support for **hardware-accelerated H.264, H.265/HEVC, and AV1 video encoding and decoding**, plus hardware-accelerated decoding support for the **VP9 codec**.\n \n * The X Elite can use up to **64GB of LPDDR5x RAM** with up to **136 GB/s of memory bandwidth** to the chip. The image signal processor (ISP) supports up to 64 MP cameras and 4K HDR video capture. The chip supports **PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs and the UFS 4.0 and SD 3.0 storage standards**, as well as up to **three USB 4 ports (plus two more 10 Gbps USB 3.2 gen 2 ports)**.\n\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide/assets/45159366/44442def-d217-4c19-a84f-a966e7f26cdb\">\n</br>\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n</p>\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide/assets/45159366/2468ec9a-a4be-4767-9af9-2a26723c6e00\">\n</br>\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n</p>\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide/assets/45159366/1b64da93-a9cd-453c-9b74-1525ea269a96\">\n</br>\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n</p>\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide/assets/45159366/8997a5fc-2f91-4b6e-b549-974bdfa8e6d4\">\n</br>\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n</p>\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide/assets/45159366/603595d4-8c60-4698-8715-89b386d675c5\">\n</br>\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n</p>\n\n <p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide/assets/45159366/e65c5451-dce9-4fda-9174-02400089dd9b\">\n</br>\nImage credit: Qualcomm\n</p>\n\n### Snapdragon X Elite Benchmarks\n\n|Geekbench 6 |(multi-core) scores|\n|-------------|-----------------|\n|Snapdragon X Elite (Config A)|\t15,130|\n|Snapdragon X Elite (Config B)|\t14,000|\n|Apple M2|\t8,911|\n|Apple M2 Pro|\t14,965|\n|Apple M2 Max|\t14,939|\n|Intel Core i7-13000H|\t12,171|\n\n|3DMark |  Wild Life Extreme Unlimited |\n|-------------|-----------------|\n|Snapdragon X Elite|\t44.5 fps (Config A) | 39 fps (Config B)|\n|MacBook Pro 14-inch M2 Pro|\t73 fps|\n|MacBook Pro 14-inch M2 Max|\t80 fps|\n|MacBook Pro 13-inch M2 |\t40.5 fps|\n\n\n## Bypass Windows 11 Requirements\n[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide#table-of-contents)\n\n**Note 1: Before performing any upgrade to your system make sure to do a full backup of your system in case anything happens during the upgrade process!**\n\n**Note 2: Some anti-cheat software for video games(like Valorant) will require TPM, Secure Boot on Windows 11.**\n\n[Ways to install Windows 11 on Unsupported hardware | Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ways-to-install-windows-11-e0edbbfb-cfc5-4011-868b-2ce77ac7c70e)\n\n[Fido](https://github.com/pbatard/Fido) is a PowerShell script that is primarily designed to be used in [Rufus](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus), but that can also be used in standalone fashion, and whose purpose is to automate access to the official Microsoft Windows retail ISO download links as well as provide convenient access to bootable UEFI Shell images.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/158471944-242c2dba-e40a-4802-9a34-e767e14d1c18.png\">\n  <br />\n  Fido\n</p>\n\n**OR**\n\n[Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/158471950-74640216-66ed-407b-a615-e643284ba0b8.png\">\n  <br />\n  Rufus\n</p>\n\n**In Rufus 3.19:**\n\nAdd a new selection dialog for Windows 11 setup customization:\n\n  * Secure Boot and TPM bypass have now been moved to this dialog.\n  * Allows to bypass the mandatory requirement for a Microsoft account on Windows 11 22H2.\n    **(Note: Network must be temporarily disabled for the local account creation to be proposed).**\n  * Added an option to skip all collection questions (Sets all answers to “Don’t allow”).\n  * Added an option for setting internal drives offline for Windows To Go.\n  \n <p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/183272077-015b8bb2-af94-443a-a455-f2018fcbd52a.png\">\n  <br />\n  Rufus 3.19 Windows 11 setup customization.\n</p>\n\n## Creating a Local Account on Windows 11 Home and Pro\n[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide#table-of-contents)\n\n**In Windows 11 Home and Pro editions Microsoft will require you to sign-in with Microsoft Account.

Before you go offline, connect to the Xbox network to sync your most recent game save to the cloud. While you play offline, your game save progress will continue to be saved locally, and it’ll sync the next time you sign in to Xbox. If you want to continue playing on a different device, you’ll need to go online and connect to the Xbox network to allow your local saved game to sync with the cloud again.\n\n * **Note 2:** PC Game Pass game licenses expire after 30 days when playing offline, and licenses for owned games expire after 14 days. To keep playing your game offline, go back online and launch the game. This renews the game’s license on your device and ensures you can go back to playing offline.  \n\nYou can only have one device as your designated offline device. **To set your device as your designated offline device:**\n\n  * Make sure that you’re online.\n  * Check that your device has the latest Windows updates: **Go to Start -> Settings -> Update & security -> Windows Update and see if any relevant updates are available**.\n  * Open the Microsoft Store. You’ll be prompted to sign in if you haven’t already.\n  * Select your profile icon in the upper right corner.\n  * Select App settings, and then under Offline permissions, make sure that the toggle is set to On.\n\nOnce you set this, any devices previously designated as offline will be toggled to Off, and you’ll no longer be able to play games offline on those devices.\n\n**Prepare your game or games**\n\nOnce your device is set up, you’ll need to launch each game you want to play offline while signed in to the Xbox network. You only need to do this once per game, and you’ll need to do this even if you’ve already launched the game on your device.\n\n  * Make sure that you’re online, and that your device is set as your designated offline device. (See the steps above for details on how to do this.)\n  * Launch the game you want to play offline. When prompted, sign in to Xbox.\n  * Once you’ve started playing the game, you can exit at any time.\n\nRepeat this process for each game you want to play offline. Once completed, you can go offline at any time and launch those games whenever you want to play them, without needing to sign in online each time.\n  \n\n## Manage/Control Fans\n\n[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)\n\n[Fan Control](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases) is a highly customizable fan controlling software for Windows\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/168446885-58a41783-cfbb-4058-a9c9-21bd01a49c3f.png\">\n<br />\nFan Control main UI\n</p>\n\n[MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/page/afterburner) is a tool that provides a detailed overview of your hardware, and also allows graphics card overclocking.

This may also apply to single-player games with an embedded or dedicated multiplayer portion. **Use at your own risk.**\n\n#### What is DXVK?\n\n[DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) is a set of software libraries that translates DirectX API calls to Vulkan API calls. It supports **DirectX versions 9, 10 and 11**. Vulkan and APIs similar to it **(DirectX12, Metal)** are a a lot better at making use of multi-core/multi-threaded CPUs to batch up work that needs to be done by the GPU thereby making better use of both CPU and GPU. This can lead to significant performance boosts in some games.\n\n**First, do these steps:**\n\n  * 1. Download the [latest release of DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases) from GitHub.\n\n  * 2. Use 7-Zip to unzip the ```dxvk-x.x.x folder``` (where ```x.x.x``` is the version number).\n  \n **Do these steps for each game:**\n\n**Important information you need to know about the game you want use DXVK with:**\n\n   * The version of DirectX it uses.\n\n   * Whether it's using 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\nIn most cases, you can find out both of these from a game's API section section on [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home). There may be some clues in the file/folder names your game's folder about it being 32-bit or 64-bit. If there's a ```steam_api64.dll``` there then it's probably **64-bit** or if there's a ```binkw32.dll``` it's likely to be **32-bit**.\n\n * Open the folder where your game's executable is (.exe file).\n\n * Open the folder where you extracted DXVK and go the appropriate folder for your game's bitness, x32 for 32-bit, x64 for 64-bit.\n\n * Copy the following files to the folder where the game's executable is depending on the game's DirectX version:\n\n|DirectX version | Files to copy|\n|------------|-----------|\n|9\t| d3d9.dll|\n|10\t| d3d10.dll, d3d10_1.dll, d3d10core.dll, d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll|\n|11\t| d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll|\n\n**If your game supports multiple DirectX versions copy all the applicable DLLs.**\n\n**That's it!** Now run the game.\n\n**Unfortunately, DXVK isn't going to work in all situations. So far I've been unsuccessful in getting it to work in the following scenarios:**\n\n   * Xbox Game Pass (and likely Microsoft Store) games.\n   * Steam In-Home Streaming with exclusive fullscreen games.\n\n## Improving Game Performance & Load Times\n\n### DirectStorage\n\n[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)\n\n[DirectStorage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/system/overviews/directstorage/directstorage-overview) is a feature intended to allow games to make full use of high-speed storage (such as NVMe SSDs) that can can deliver multiple gigabytes a second of small (eg 64kb) data reads with minimal CPU overhead. Although it is possible to saturate a drive using traditional ReadFile-based IO the CPU overhead of increases non-linearly as the size of individual reads decreases. Additionally, most games choose to store their assets compressed on disk in order to reduce the install footprint, with these assets being decompressed on the fly as load time. The CPU overhead of this becomes increasingly expensive as bandwidth increases.\n\n * [Microsoft DirectStorage GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectStorage)\n * [DirectStorage on Windows Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectStorage/blob/main/README.md)\n * [DirectStorage API Downloads](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-api-downloads/)\n \n New features for DirectStorage 1.1:\n \n * GPU decompression and GDeflate now available.\n * Added EnqueueSetEvent to use Win32 event objects for completion notification.\n * [Performance improvements and bug fixes.](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-api-downloads/)\n    \n**GPU decompression** is supported on all DirectX 12 + Shader Model 6.0 GPUs.

This generally infers that a connection is built before the data transfer (by following the procedures laid out in a protocol) and then is deconstructed at the at the end of the data transfer.\n\n    • Packet: A packet is, generally speaking, the most basic unit that is transferred over a network. When communicating over a network, packets are the envelopes that carry your data (in pieces) from one end point to the other.\n\nPackets have a header portion that contains information about the packet including the source and destination, timestamps, network hops. The main portion of a packet contains the actual data being transferred. It is sometimes called the body or the payload.\n\n    • Network Interface: A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. For instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface associated with them individually.\n\nA network interface may be associated with a physical device, or it may be a representation of a virtual interface. The \"loop-back\" device, which is a virtual interface to the local machine, is an example of this.\n\n    • LAN: LAN stands for \"local area network\". It refers to a network or a portion of a network that is not publicly accessible to the greater internet. A home or office network is an example of a LAN.\n\n    • WAN: WAN stands for \"wide area network\". It means a network that is much more extensive than a LAN. While WAN is the relevant term to use to describe large, dispersed networks in general, it is usually meant to mean the internet, as a whole.\nIf an interface is connected to the WAN, it is generally assumed that it is reachable through the internet.\n\n    • Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that basically define a language that devices can use to communicate. There are a great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers.\n\nSome low level protocols are TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Some familiar examples of application layer protocols, built on these lower protocols, are HTTP (for accessing web content), SSH, TLS/SSL, and FTP.\n\n    • Port: A port is an address on a single machine that can be tied to a specific piece of software. It is not a physical interface or location, but it allows your server to be able to communicate using more than one application.\n\n    • Firewall: A firewall is a program that decides whether traffic coming into a server or going out should be allowed. A firewall usually works by creating rules for which type of traffic is acceptable on which ports. Generally, firewalls block ports that are not used by a specific application on a server.\n\n    • NAT: Network address translation is a way to translate requests that are incoming into a routing server to the relevant devices or servers that it knows about in the LAN. This is usually implemented in physical LANs as a way to route requests through one IP address to the necessary backend servers.\n\n    • VPN: Virtual private network is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often for security reasons.\n\n## Network Layers\n\n\tWhile networking is often discussed in terms of topology in a horizontal way, between hosts, its implementation is layered in a vertical fashion throughout a computer or network. This means is that there are multiple technologies and protocols that are built on top of each other in order for communication to function more easily. Each successive, higher layer abstracts the raw data a little bit more, and makes it simpler to use for applications and users. It also allows you to leverage lower layers in new ways without having to invest the time and energy to develop the protocols and applications that handle those types of traffic.\n\n\tAs data is sent out of one machine, it begins at the top of the stack and filters downwards. At the lowest level, actual transmission to another machine takes place. At this point, the data travels back up through the layers of the other computer. Each layer has the ability to add its own \"wrapper\" around the data that it receives from the adjacent layer, which will help the layers that come after decide what to do with the data when it is passed off.\n\n\tOne method of talking about the different layers of network communication is the OSI model. OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnect.This model defines seven separate layers. The layers in this model are:\n\n    • Application: The application layer is the layer that the users and user-applications most often interact with. Network communication is discussed in terms of availability of resources, partners to communicate with, and data synchronization.\n\n    • Presentation: The presentation layer is responsible for mapping resources and creating context. It is used to translate lower level networking data into data that applications expect to see.\n\n    • Session: The session layer is a connection handler. It creates, maintains, and destroys connections between nodes in a persistent way.\n\n    • Transport: The transport layer is responsible for handing the layers above it a reliable connection. In this context, reliable refers to the ability to verify that a piece of data was received intact at the other end of the connection. This layer can resend information that has been dropped or corrupted and can acknowledge the receipt of data to remote computers.\n\n    • Network: The network layer is used to route data between different nodes on the network. It uses addresses to be able to tell which computer to send information to. This layer can also break apart larger messages into smaller chunks to be reassembled on the opposite end.\n\n    • Data Link: This layer is implemented as a method of establishing and maintaining reliable links between different nodes or devices on a network using existing physical connections.\n\n    • Physical: The physical layer is responsible for handling the actual physical devices that are used to make a connection. This layer involves the bare software that manages physical connections as well as the hardware itself (like Ethernet).\n\nThe TCP/IP model, more commonly known as the Internet protocol suite, is another layering model that is simpler and has been widely adopted.It defines the four separate layers, some of which overlap with the OSI model:\n\n    • Application: In this model, the application layer is responsible for creating and transmitting user data between applications. The applications can be on remote systems, and should appear to operate as if locally to the end user.\nThe communication takes place between peers network.\n\n    • Transport: The transport layer is responsible for communication between processes. This level of networking utilizes ports to address different services. It can build up unreliable or reliable connections depending on the type of protocol used.\n\n    • Internet: The internet layer is used to transport data from node to node in a network. This layer is aware of the endpoints of the connections, but does not worry about the actual connection needed to get from one place to another. IP addresses are defined in this layer as a way of reaching remote systems in an addressable manner.\n\n    • Link: The link layer implements the actual topology of the local network that allows the internet layer to present an addressable interface. It establishes connections between neighboring nodes to send data.\n\n## Interfaces\nInterfaces are networking communication points for your computer. Each interface is associated with a physical or virtual networking device. Typically, your server will have one configurable network interface for each Ethernet or wireless internet card you have. In addition, it will define a virtual network interface called the \"loopback\" or localhost interface. This is used as an interface to connect applications and processes on a single computer to other applications and processes. You can see this referenced as the \"lo\" interface in many tools.\n\n## Protocols\nNetworking works by piggybacks on a number of different protocols on top of each other. In this way, one piece of data can be transmitted using multiple protocols encapsulated within one another.\n\nMedia access control is a communications protocol that is used to distinguish specific devices. Each device is supposed to get a unique MAC address during the manufacturing process that differentiates it from every other device on the internet. Addressing hardware by the MAC address allows you to reference a device by a unique value even when the software on top may change the name for that specific device during operation. Media access control is one of the only protocols from the link layer that you are likely to interact with on a regular basis.\n\nThe IP protocol is one of the fundamental protocols that allow the internet to work. IP addresses are unique on each network and they allow machines to address each other across a network. It is implemented on the internet layer in the IP/TCP model. Networks can be linked together, but traffic must be routed when crossing network boundaries. This protocol assumes an unreliable network and multiple paths to the same destination that it can dynamically change between. There are a number of different implementations of the protocol. The most common implementation today is IPv4, although IPv6 is growing in popularity as an alternative due to the scarcity of IPv4 addresses available and improvements in the protocols capabilities.\n\nICMP: internet control message protocol is used to send messages between devices to indicate the availability or error conditions. These packets are used in a variety of network diagnostic tools, such as ping and traceroute. Usually ICMP packets are transmitted when a packet of a different kind meets some kind of a problem. Basically, they are used as a feedback mechanism for network communications.\n\nTCP: Transmission control protocol is implemented in the transport layer of the IP/TCP model and is used to establish reliable connections. TCP is one of the protocols that encapsulates data into packets. It then transfers these to the remote end of the connection using the methods available on the lower layers. On the other end, it can check for errors, request certain pieces to be resent, and reassemble the information into one logical piece to send to the application layer. The protocol builds up a connection prior to data transfer using a system called a three-way handshake. This is a way for the two ends of the communication to acknowledge the request and agree upon a method of ensuring data reliability. After the data has been sent, the connection is torn down using a similar four-way handshake. TCP is the protocol of choice for many of the most popular uses for the internet, including WWW, FTP, SSH, and email. It is safe to say that the internet we know today would not be here without TCP.\n\nUDP: User datagram protocol is a popular companion protocol to TCP and is also implemented in the transport layer. The fundamental difference between UDP and TCP is that UDP offers unreliable data transfer. It does not verify that data has been received on the other end of the connection. This might sound like a bad thing, and for many purposes, it is. However, it is also extremely important for some functions. It’s not required to wait for confirmation that the data was received and forced to resend data, UDP is much faster than TCP. It does not establish a connection with the remote host, it simply fires off the data to that host and doesn't care if it is accepted or not. Since UDP is a simple transaction, it is useful for simple communications like querying for network resources. It also doesn't maintain a state, which makes it great for transmitting data from one machine to many real-time clients. This makes it ideal for VOIP, games, and other applications that cannot afford delays.\n\nHTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol is a protocol defined in the application layer that forms the basis for communication on the web. HTTP defines a number of functions that tell the remote system what you are requesting. For instance, GET, POST, and DELETE all interact with the requested data in a different way.\n\n[JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io) is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS).\n\n[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) is an open source authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter GitHub, and DigitalOcean. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.\n\nFTP: File transfer protocol is in the application layer and provides a way of transferring complete files from one host to another. It is inherently insecure, so it is not recommended for any externally facing network unless it is implemented as a public, download-only resource.\n\nDNS: Domain name system is an application layer protocol used to provide a human-friendly naming mechanism for internet resources. It is what ties a domain name to an IP address and allows you to access sites by name in your browser.\n\nSSH: Secure shell is an encrypted protocol implemented in the application layer that can be used to communicate with a remote server in a secure way. Many additional technologies are built around this protocol because of its end-to-end encryption and ubiquity. There are many other protocols that we haven't covered that are equally important. However, this should give you a good overview of some of the fundamental technologies that make the internet and networking possible.\n\n## Virtualization\n\n[KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine)](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko.\n\n[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) is a fast processor emulator using a portable dynamic translator. QEMU emulates a full system, including a processor and various peripherals. It can be used to launch a different Operating System without rebooting the PC or to debug system code.\n\n[Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/) enables running virtualized computer systems on top of a physical host. These virtualized systems can be used and managed just as if they were physical computer systems, however they exist in virtualized and isolated environment. Special software called a hypervisor manages access between the virtual systems and the physical hardware resources.
