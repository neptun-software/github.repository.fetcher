Get your license here: https://reportgenerator.io/pro\n                       License can also be supplied via 'REPORTGENERATOR_LICENSE' environment variable.\n\nDefault values:\n   -reporttypes:Html\n   -assemblyfilters:+*\n   -classfilters:+*\n   -filefilters:+*\n   -riskhotspotassemblyfilters:+*\n   -riskhotspotclassfilters:+*\n   -verbosity:Info\n\nExamples:\n   \"-reports:coverage.xml\" \"-targetdir:C:\\report\"\n   \"-reports:target\\*\\*.xml\" \"-targetdir:C:\\report\" -reporttypes:Latex;HtmlSummary -title:IntegrationTest -tag:v1.4.5\n   \"-reports:coverage1.xml;coverage2.xml\" \"-targetdir:report\" \"-sourcedirs:C:\\MyProject\" -plugins:CustomReports.dll\n   \"-reports:coverage.xml\" \"-targetdir:C:\\report\" \"-assemblyfilters:+Included;-Excluded.*\"\n```\n\n#### .netconfig support\n\nAll the above parameters can also be persisted in a [.netconfig](https://dotnetconfig.org) file, under a `[ReportGenerator]` \nsection. Examples:\n\n```gitconfig\n[ReportGenerator]\n\treports = \"coverage.xml\"\n\ttargetdir = \"C:\\\\report\"\n\treporttypes = \"Latex;HtmlSummary\"\n\tassemblyfilters = \"+Test;-Test\"\n\tclassfilters = \"+Test2;-Test2\"\n```\n\nAll the plural options can also be specified as multiple singular entries, like:\n\n```gitconfig\n[ReportGenerator]\n\treport = \"coverage1.xml\"\n\treport = \"coverage2.xml\"\n\treporttype = \"Latex\"\n\treporttype = \"HtmlSummary\"\n\tassemblyfilter = \"+Test\"\n\tassemblyfilter = \"-Test\"\n\tclassfilter = \"+Test2\"\n\tclassfilter = \"-Test2\"\n\tfilefilter = \"+cs\"\n\tfilefilter = \"-vb\"\n\triskhotspotassemblyfilter = \"+Test\"\n\triskhotspotassemblyfilter = \"-Test\"\n\triskhotspotclassfilter = \"+Test2\"\n\triskhotspotclassfilter = \"-Test2\"\n\tsourcedir = \"src\"\n\tsourcedir = \"test\"\n```\n\nAdding/removing values is trivial using the [dotnet-config](https://dotnetconfig.org) CLI:\n\n```bash\n# set a single-valued variable\ndotnet config reportgenerator.reporttypes Latex;HtmlSummary\n# add to multi-valued variable\ndotnet config --add reportgenerator.report coverage3.xml\n# clear all multi-valued entries for a variable\ndotnet config --unset-all reportgenerator.assemblyfilter\n```\n\nOf course it's equally trivial to just edit the `.netconfig` file by hand.\n\n#### MSBuild\nA MSBuild task also exists:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<Project DefaultTargets=\"Coverage\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\" ToolsVersion=\"4.0\">\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ReportGenerator\" Version=\"x.y.z\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n  <Target Name=\"Coverage\">\n    <ItemGroup>\n      <CoverageFiles Include=\"OpenCover.xml\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n    <ReportGenerator ProjectDirectory=\"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\" ReportFiles=\"@(CoverageFiles)\" TargetDirectory=\"report\" ReportTypes=\"Html;Latex\" HistoryDirectory=\"history\" Plugins=\"CustomReports.dll\" AssemblyFilters=\"+Include;-Excluded\" VerbosityLevel=\"Verbose\" />\n  </Target>\n</Project>\n```\n\nThe MSBuild task parameters can be complemented with the `.netconfig`, if used. That means that parameters \ncan be omitted if they are provided via `.netconfig`, which is useful when reusing fixed settings across \nmultiple projects in a solution, where the MSBuild task is only provided the dynamic values for the current \nproject:\n\nGiven the following `.netconfig`:\n\n```gitconfig\n[ReportGenerator]\n  reporttypes = \"Html;Latex\"\n  targetdirectory = \"report\"\n  historydirectory = \"history\"\n  assemblyfilters = \"+Include;-Excluded\"\n  verbosityLevel = \"Verbose\"\n```\n\nThe above target could be simplified as:\n\n```xml\n  <Target Name=\"Coverage\">\n    <ItemGroup>\n      <CoverageFiles Include=\"OpenCover.xml\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n    <ReportGenerator ProjectDirectory=\"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\"\n                     ReportFiles=\"@(CoverageFiles)\" \n                     Plugins=\"CustomReports.dll\" />\n  </Target>\n```\n\n\n## Supported input and output file formats\n*ReportGenerator* supports several input and output formats.  \nThe wiki explains the different [output formats](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator/wiki/Output-formats) or you can download [sample reports](https://danielpalme.github.io/ReportGenerator/resources/SampleReports.zip) of all supported output formats.  \nIf you need a custom format, you can create a [plugin](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator/wiki/Custom-reports).\n\n| **Input formats** | **Output formats** |\n|:------------------|:-------------------|\n|
