Windows *Aero*) enabled.\n\n## Installation\n\nGet the¬†[latest version](https://github.com/LorenzCK/OnTopReplica/releases)¬†from the releases section as an MSI&nbsp;installer.\n\n## Contributions\n\n‚Ä¶are very welcome. Fork away! üçΩÔ∏è\n\nSubmitting [issues](https://github.com/LorenzCK/OnTopReplica/issues) and other feedback is also appreciated.\n\n### Roadmap\n\n1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;Update to the newest [WindowsFormsAero](https://github.com/LorenzCK/WindowsFormsAero) version.\n1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;Migrate to .NET 4.7.\n1. Improve/add **High DPI** support!\n1. ‚ÄúStored scenarios‚Äù that, just like stored regions, automatically clone a window (based on title or window class criteria), select a region, and set other options. Ideally to be used as Taskbar shortlinks.\n1. Move to the Windows Store, via Centennial. ü§û\n\n## License\n\n**OnTopReplica** is licensed under the [MS-RL (Microsoft Reciprocal License)](https://github.com/LorenzCK/OnTopReplica/blob/master/LICENSE).\n"
