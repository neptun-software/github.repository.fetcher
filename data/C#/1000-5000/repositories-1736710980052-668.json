Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at michael.c.pendon@outlook.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]\n\n[homepage]: http://contributor-covenant.org\n[version]: http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/\n"

The good thing is, it also does provide the operations that is needed to cater your edge-cases like [2nd-Layer Cache](https://repodb.net/feature/caching), [Tracing](https://repodb.net/feature/tracing), [Repositories](https://repodb.net/feature/repositories), [Property Handlers](https://repodb.net/feature/propertyhandlers) and [Batch](https://repodb.net/feature/batchoperations)/[Bulk Operations](https://repodb.net/feature/bulkoperations).\n\nIf you are to use [RepoDB](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/blob/master/RepoDb.Docs/development-experience.md#repodb), your [development experience](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/blob/master/RepoDb.Docs/development-experience.md) is as simple as opening a connection and calling the advance operations with a very minimal code. It is the reason that makes this library the simpliest ORM to use.\n\nWhen you do the [bulk operations](https://repodb.net/feature/bulkoperations), the generated value of the [identity columns](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/blob/master/RepoDb.Docs/bulk-operation-edge-cases.md#identity-columns) will be set back to the data models, just right after your execution. It is an important use-case that is/may needed by you and/or most developers, and both the [BulkInsert](https://repodb.net/operation/bulkinsert) and [BulkMerge](https://repodb.net/operation/bulkmerge) operations addressed this need.\n\nRepoDB also does support the different way-of-executions (the [atomic](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/blob/master/RepoDb.Docs/atomic-batch-bulk.md#atomic-operation), the [batch](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/blob/master/RepoDb.Docs/atomic-batch-bulk.md#batch-operation) and the [bulk](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/blob/master/RepoDb.Docs/atomic-batch-bulk.md#bulk-operation)). Through this, it is easy for you to establish your repository that can process the smallest-to-the-largest datasets without even affecting the efficiency and the performance of your application.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Important Attributes</b></summary>\n\n<p>\n\n**Easy to Use** - the operations were all implemented as extension methods of your IDbConnection object. For as long your connection is open, any operations can then be called against your database.\n\n**High Performant** - it caches the already-generated compiled expressions for future reusabilities and executions. It understands your schema to create the most optimal compiled expression AOT.\n\n**Memory Efficient** - it extracts and caches your object properties, execution contexts, object mappings and SQL statements. It is reusing them all throughout the process of transformations and executions.\n\n**Dynamic and Hybrid** - it provides some advance features of the full-fledged ORMs. It significantly help the developers to simplify the experience when context-switching during the development.\n\n**Open-Source Software** - it is an open-source software and will always be free. It is authored to further improve the .NET data access experiences and solutions, together with the collective ideas of the community.\n\n**High Quality** - it is a high-quality micro-ORM supported by 10K+ real-life Unit and Integration Tests. It is highly tested and is used by various critical systems that are running in the Production environment.\n\n</p>\n\n</details>\n\n## Get Started\n\nPlease click any of the link below to fast-track your learnings.\n\n- [SqlServer](http://repodb.net/tutorial/get-started-sqlserver)\n- [SqLite](http://repodb.net/tutorial/get-started-sqlite)\n- [MySql](http://repodb.net/tutorial/get-started-mysql)\n- [PostgreSql](http://repodb.net/tutorial/get-started-postgresql)\n\nOr, learn a specific feature.\n\n- [Batch Operations](http://repodb.net/feature/batchoperations)\n- [Bulk Operations](http://repodb.net/feature/bulkoperations)\n- [Caching](http://repodb.net/feature/caching)\n- [Class Handlers](http://repodb.net/feature/classhandlers)\n- [Class Mapping](http://repodb.net/feature/classmapping)\n- [Dynamics](http://repodb.net/feature/dynamics)\n- [Connection Persistency](http://repodb.net/feature/connectionpersistency)\n- [Enumeration](http://repodb.net/feature/enumeration)\n- [Expression Trees](http://repodb.net/feature/expressiontrees)\n- [Hints](http://repodb.net/feature/hints)\n- [Implicit Mapping](http://repodb.net/feature/implicitmapping)\n- [Multiple Query](http://repodb.net/feature/multiplequery)\n- [Property Handlers](http://repodb.net/feature/propertyhandlers)\n- [Repositories](http://repodb.net/feature/repositories)\n- [Targeted Operations](http://repodb.net/feature/targeted)\n- [Tracing](http://repodb.net/feature/tracing)\n- [Transaction](http://repodb.net/feature/transaction)\n- [Type Mapping](http://repodb.net/feature/typemapping)\n\nOtherwise, please visit our [documentation](http://repodb.net/docs) page to learn more.\n\n## Supported Databases\n\nThe execute methods below support all the RDBMS data providers.\n\n- [ExecuteQuery](http://repodb.net/operation/executequery)\n- [ExecuteNonQuery](http://repodb.net/operation/executenonquery)\n- [ExecuteScalar](http://repodb.net/operation/executescalar)\n- [ExecuteReader](http://repodb.net/operation/executereader)\n- [ExecuteQueryMultiple](http://repodb.net/operation/executequerymultiple)\n\nWhereas the fluent methods below only support the [SQL Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqlServer), [SQLite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqLite), [MySQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.MySql) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.PostgreSql) RDBMS data providers.\n\n- [Query](http://repodb.net/operation/query)\n- [Insert](http://repodb.net/operation/insert)\n- [Merge](http://repodb.net/operation/merge)\n- [Delete](http://repodb.net/operation/delete)\n- [Update](http://repodb.net/operation/update)\n \nClick [here](http://repodb.net/operation) to see all the operations.\n\n## Package Referencing\n\nBy default, .NET is auto-resolving the references, however, we strongly recommend that you always explicitly reference the [RepoDb](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb) core library. The rationale behind this is that, the [RepoDb](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb) core library is a fast-moving package in which all the alpha/beta releases, hotfixes and/or even the actual releases could happen without affecting the extension libraries.\n\nPlease note that we are releasing an actual next released-version if the changes are having minimal impact but is important for the other users.\n\nYou can always target the version when installing the library, even it is on a semantic release.\n\n```csharp\n> Install-Package RepoDb -version 1.x.x-betaX\n```\n\n## .NET Type Coercion\n\nBy default, RepoDB does not do the automatic .NET CLR Type conversion during the serialization and deserialization process. The coercion support is completely dependent to the ADO.NET coercion capability.\n\nIt is in purpose to strictly notify you (as a library user) the design and/or the implementation problem of the entity model if being compared to its corresponding database table/view.\n\nIf you wish to have an automatic conversion, simply set the [Converter.ConversionType](https://repodb.net/class/converter) property to [Automatic](https://repodb.net/enumeration/conversiontype).\n\n```csharp\nRepoDb.Converter.ConversionType = ConversionType.Automatic;\n```\n\n**Note:** The exception that is being thrown is dependent to what the underlying ADO.NET coercion exception. If the [Automatic](https://repodb.net/enumeration/conversiontype) conversion is used, the extracted value will always be evaluated and an additional conversion logic will be used (if needed). The conversion logic is through the AOT compilation of [System.Linq.Expressions.Expression.Convert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.expression.convert?view=netcore-3.1) and/or [System.Convert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert?view=netcore-3.1).\n\n## Exception Handling\n\nAs the compiler exception is a bit low-level and is not descriptive for the native language, therefore, when compiling the process of hydration from/to the database and the application, a customized exception is being thrown to provide a detailed exception messages to the callers.\n\nOn the other hand, as part of the standard when writing code in RepoDB (i.e.: respect the default exception handling of .NET, ensure an unharmonized exception when bubbling up the exception messages), RepoDB does not contain a single line of code that catches and rethrowing any exception (try-catch statement). Any exception happens within the library whether it is an ADO.NET exception and/or whatever will be bubble up natively back to the callers.\n\n## System.Data.SqlClient\n\nIf you are working with this package, you are required to bootstrap the connection object on the startup.\n\n```csharp\nvar dbSetting = new SqlServerDbSetting();\n\nDbSettingMapper\n\t.Add<System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection>(dbSetting, true);\nDbHelperMapper\n\t.Add<System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection>(new SqlServerDbHelper(), true);\nStatementBuilderMapper\n\t.Add<System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection>(new SqlServerStatementBuilder(dbSetting), true);\n```\n\nOr, you can replicate the actual [SqlServerBootstrap](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB/blob/master/RepoDb.SqlServer/RepoDb.SqlServer/SqlServerBootstrap.cs) class implementation and attach it to your solution. Then, call the local class initializer method explicitly.\n\n## Trust Server Certificate\n\nFor [RepoDb.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqlServer) package, starting the version [v1.1.5-beta4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqlServer/1.1.5-beta4), the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient v4.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient/4.0.0) is used, however, it seems to require a TLS 1.2 when connecting to the database via Integrated Security.\n\nIn most cases, an exception below is thrown if the mentioned security chain is not enabled.\n\n```csharp\nA connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process.\n(provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)\n---> System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted..\n```\n\nThe issue above can be rectified by simply enabling the TLS 1.2. Alternatively, the argument [TrustServerCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnectionstringbuilder.trustservercertificate?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) can be used on the connection string.\n\n**Note:** By enabling the [TrustServerCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnectionstringbuilder.trustservercertificate?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) argument, as per Microsoft, _the transport layer will use SSL to encrypt the channel and bypass walking the certificate chain to validate trust_. Therefore, only enable this flag if needed.\n\n## Library Limitations\n\nIt is very important for you and to the community of .NET to learn the things the library is capable and is-not capable of doing, so please spend time reading the [limitation](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/blob/master/RepoDb.Docs/limitations.md) page before using the library.\n\n## Benchmark\n\nThe benchmark result shown on this section is the result of the community-approved ORM bencher tool, the [RawDataAccessBencher](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher) tool.\n\nBelow is the actual recent official execution [result](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher/blob/master/Results/20201112_net5_ef5.txt).\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikependon/RepoDb.NET/master/assets/backgrounds/statistics.png\" />\n\nRepoDB shows an impressive performance and memory-efficiency if being compared with other ORMs available in the .NET ecosystem. It has positioned itself just right behind the logic-less hand-coded materializer if being benchmark with .NET Core and .NET Framework. However, RepoDB is the fastest and the most-efficient ORM if being benchmark with .NET 5, even beating the hand-coded materializer.\n\n### Important Note\n\nThe AOT compilation (IL/Expression) has some degree of performance impact, even just for milliseconds, therefore, if you are to materialize RepoDB, it is highly recommended to always eliminate the first execution.\n\nTo avoid the bias, you as well should exclude the first execution of the other ORMs during the benchmarking.\n\n## Contributions\n\nWe would like to make RepoDB the mainstream hybrid-ORM library for .NET technology. Please help us build and realize the solution.\n\nTo contribute, please find a [for-grabs](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22for+grabs%22) item and issue a PR.
