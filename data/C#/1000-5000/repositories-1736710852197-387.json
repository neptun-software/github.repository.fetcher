Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at team@exceptionless.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]\n\n[homepage]: http://contributor-covenant.org\n[version]: http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/\n"

The Exceptionless team is legally prevented from accepting any pull requests from users who have not signed the CLA first.\n\n## Reporting Bugs\n\n1. Always update to the most recent main release; the bug may already be resolved.\n\n2. Search for similar [issues](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug); it may already be an identified problem. Also, feel free to ask us questions [on Discord](https://discord.gg/6HxgFCx).\n\n3. Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/exceptionless/exceptionless/issues) with a reproduction of the bug including workflows, screenshots, or links to examples. If possible, submit a Pull Request with a failing test. If you'd rather take matters into your own hands, fix the bug yourself (jump down to the \"Contributing (Step-by-step)\" section).\n\n## Requesting New Features\n\n1. Search for similar [feature requests](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement). It's possible somebody has already asked for this feature or provided a pull request that we're still discussing.\n\n2. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add. The feature must apply to a wide array of users of Exceptionless. You may also want to provide us with some advance documentation on the feature, which will help the community to better understand where it will fit.\n\n3. If you're a Rock Star programmer, build the feature yourself (refer to the \"Contributing (Step-by-step)\" section below).\n\n## Contributing (Step-by-step)\n\n1. Refer to the GitHub documentation on how to fork the repository:\n\n    https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo\n\n2. Follow the Coding Conventions\n  * Adhere to common conventions you see in the existing code\n  * Include tests, and ensure they pass\n  * Search to see if your new functionality has been discussed on [the Exceptionless issues](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues), and include updates as appropriate\n  * four spaces, no tabs\n  * no trailing whitespaces, blank lines should have no spaces\n  * use spaces around operators, after commas, colons, semicolons, around `{` and before `}`\n  * no space after `(`, `[` or before `]`, `)`\n\n  > However, please note that **pull requests consisting entirely of style changes are not welcome on this project**. Style changes in the context of pull requests that also refactor code, fix bugs, improve functionality *are* welcome.\n\n3. Issue a Pull Request\n\n    https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests\n  \n  Thanks for that -- we'll get to your pull request ASAP, we love pull requests!\n\n10. Responding to Feedback\n\n  The Exceptionless team may recommend adjustments to your code. Part of interacting with a healthy open-source community requires you to be open to learning new techniques and strategies; *don't get discouraged!* Remember: if the Exceptionless team suggest changes to your code, **they care enough about your work that they want to include it**, and hope that you can assist by implementing those revisions on your own.\n  \n\n## Appreciation\n\nAnyone who submits a non-trivial pull request will be given a free [Exceptionless](http://exceptionless.com) paid plan for a year. After your pull request is accepted, simply send an email to team@exceptionless.io with the name of your organization and we will upgrade you to a paid plan.\n"

[Exceptionless](https://exceptionless.com) provides real-time error reporting for your JavaScript, Node, .NET Core, ASP.NET, Web API, WebForms, WPF, Console, and MVC apps. It organizes the gathered information into simple actionable data that will help your app become exceptionless!\n\n⭐️ We appreciate your star, it helps!\n\n## Using Exceptionless\n\nRefer to the [Exceptionless documentation](https://exceptionless.com/docs/).\n\n## Hosting Options\n\nWe provide very reasonably priced hosting at [Exceptionless](https://exceptionless.com). By using our hosted service, you are supporting the project and helping it get better! We also provide set up and support services.\n\nExceptionless can easily be run locally using Docker:\n\n- `docker run --rm -it -p 5200:8080 exceptionless/exceptionless:latest`\n- Open `http://localhost:5200`\n- Create an account. The first account in the system will automatically be an admin.\n\nThis will run a completely self-contained simple instance of Exceptionless. It is only suitable for testing purposes since it will not persist data. For more complete setups, check out the [self hosting documentation](https://exceptionless.com/docs/self-hosting/). Also, if you want to support the project while self hosting you can send us a pull request or [donation](https://github.com/sponsors/exceptionless).\n\n## Contributing\n\n_In appreciation for anyone who submits a non-trivial pull request, we will give you a free [Exceptionless](https://exceptionless.com) paid plan for a year. After your pull request is accepted, simply send an email to <team@exceptionless.io> with the name of your organization and we will upgrade you to a paid plan._\n\n- Please read the [contributing document](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- Requirements\n  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)\n  - [.NET 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)\n  - [Node 20+](https://nodejs.org/)\n- Visual Studio Code\n  - Open Visual Studio Code and then open the Exceptionless root folder\n  - Go to the `Terminal` menu and select `Run Task...` and then select `Start Elasticsearch` (you can stop the service when you are done using the `Stop Elasticsearch` task)\n  - Go to the `Debug` menu and select the `Web` launch configuration then click the `Start Debugging` button\n  - A browser window should be automatically opened to `https://localhost:5100/`\n  - When running locally in `Development` mode, a global administrator user `test@localhost` is automatically created with password `tester`. You can also click the `Signup` button to create a new account\n- Visual Studio\n  - Open Visual Studio and then open the `Exceptionless.sln` solution in the root folder\n  - Start Elasticsearch by either configuring multiple startup projects for the `docker-compose` and `Exceptionless.Web` projects or by running the `start-services.ps1` script in the root folder\n  - Run the `Exceptionless.Web` project\n  - A browser window should be automatically opened to `https://localhost:5100/`\n  - When running locally in `Development` mode, a global administrator user `test@localhost` is automatically created with password `tester`. You can also click the `Signup` button to create a new account\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/282584/223168564-6518d509-d292-4078-a61f-ab493d2bb812.png)\n\n## UI Only Development\n\nThe UI is a SPA application that runs against the Exceptionless API. The source is located in the `src/Exceptionless.Web/ClientApp` folder. The UI will automatically be started when running the whole project, but if you want to work on just the UI, then open Visual Studio Code to the `src/Exceptionless.Web/ClientApp` folder and run the `npm run serve (use exceptionless api)` task to start the UI pointing at the official Exceptionless API. You will need to login to your actual Exceptionless account.\n\n## API Only Development\n\nYou can work on just the API without running the SPA UI by selecting the `Exceptionless API` launch configuration in Visual Studio. You can then run requests using the `exceptionless.http` file. Make sure that you have the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension installed.\n\n## Thanks\n\nThanks to all the people who have contributed!\n\n[![contributors](https://contributors-img.web.app/image?repo=exceptionless/exceptionless)](https://github.com/exceptionless/exceptionless/graphs/contributors)\n\nThanks to [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com) for a community [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) license to use on this project.
