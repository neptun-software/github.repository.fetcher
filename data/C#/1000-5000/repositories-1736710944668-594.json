ATF has been used by most Sony Computer Entertainment first party game studios to make many custom tools such as Naughty Dog's level editor and shader editor for _The Last of Us_&trade;, Guerrilla Game's sequence editor for Killzone&trade; games (including the _Killzone: Shadow Fall_&trade; PS4&trade; launch title), an animation blending tool at Santa Monica Studios, a level editor at Bend Studio, a visual state machine editor for Quantic Dream, sound editing tools, and many others. ATF has been in continuous development in Sony Computer Entertainment's Worldwide Studios central tools group since early 2005.\n\nThis figure shows LevelEditor, a powerful tool built with ATF for constructing and editing game levels. LevelEditor is also an open source project, available at [LevelEditor](https://github.com/SonyWWS/LevelEditor). See other tools built with ATF at [Gallery](https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/wiki/ATF-Gallery) and [ATF adopters](https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/wiki/ATF-Adoption).\n\n![LevelEditor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/SonyWWS/ATF/images/ATF3LevelEditor.png?raw=true \"LevelEditor\")\n\nThere are many types of components in ATF. ATF Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) components can be added to a .NET TypeCatalog with a single line of code, which allows you to easily add these capabilities to your application. MEF components can be found in most of our sample applications, as in this Circuit Editor sample source file [Program.cs](https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/blob/master/Samples/CircuitEditor/Program.cs#L55). Other components, like the Document Object Model (DOM), are actually a collection of related classes. Look over a list of useful components in ATF at [Important ATF Components](https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/wiki/Important-ATF-Components).\n\nATF is an open source project. See [License.txt](https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/blob/master/License.txt).\n\n### Getting Started ###\nATF is a technology with great depth in some of its areas. To learn whether ATF is for you and to make effective use of it, you'd be well-advised to acquire the background offered in the ATF documentation, especially topics in the [ATF Getting Started](https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/wiki/ATF-Getting-Started) section. This section tells you what you need to know to use ATF:\n\n* ATF Requirements and Dependencies\n* ATF Features and Benefits\n* How to install ATF\n* Basic ATF Frameworks\n* ATF Samples and Tutorials\n* Next Steps to learn ATF\n\n### More Info ###\nThe ATF wiki is at https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/wiki.\n\nWe have PDF files in the [Docs folder](https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/tree/master/Docs) or [Documentation](https://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/wiki/ATF-Documentation).\n\n[Forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/authoring-tools-framework) for meeting other ATF users, having discussions, and receiving announcements from us ATF developers.\n\nBugs, feature requests, and questions:  \nhttps://github.com/SonyWWS/ATF/issues.\n\nContact, in English or Japanese:  \n&#097;&#116;&#102;&#095;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#112;&#108;&#097;&#121;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#046;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#121;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;\n"
