You need to own GTA in order to play it.\n\n\n## Download\n\nDownload it for [Windows](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/releases/download/v4.0/SanAndreasUnity-4.0-windows.zip), [Linux](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/releases/download/v4.0/SanAndreasUnity-4.0-linux.zip) or [Android](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Running-on-Android).\n\nThe game is tested on Linux, Windows, Mac, and Android. It supports both Mono and IL2CPP scripting backends, so it can be built for any platform that Unity supports, provided that you can copy PC version of GTASA to target device.\n\n\n## Multiplayer\n\nGame fully works in multiplayer. You can start the game as dedicated server, as a host (server & client at the same time), or you can connect to a server. This works on all supported platforms, which means you can start a host even on Android device.\n\nIf you want to host a server, take a look at [command line instructions](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Command-line) and [server administration](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Server-administration).\n\n\n## Development setup\n\n- clone the project, including submodules: `git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity`\n- open the project with Unity 2020.3.26 or newer\n- open startup scene located at Assets/Scenes/Startup.unity\n- press Play button\n\n\n## In-game controls\n\nPress Escape while in game to open pause menu. You'll see there a lot of utilities, and among them, there is a window which shows all controls.\n\n\n## Game modes\n\nGame can be extended through plugins/game modes in the form of C# DLLs. More info on [wiki](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Plugins-(Game-modes)).\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nJoin us on [discord](https://discord.gg/p6jjud5) to discuss about development.\n\nYou can check out issues for [newcomers](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), issues related to [importing assets](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aimporting) from original game, or the [whole list](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/issues) of issues.\n\nIssues that are in focus right now are those with [high priority](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apriority%3Ahigh) label and those found in [milestones](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/milestones).\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/557828/24571348/d964f098-1670-11e7-8759-0160dbf5bcb5.png)\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/557828/24571349/d96b7c24-1670-11e7-997d-ae15913481f8.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HX978mr.png)\n\n## Videos\n\n###\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/PItR-0FF7JI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PItR-0FF7JI)\n\n###\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/hnInLUbobI8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnInLUbobI8)\n\n###\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/VDfSE3nc3oM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDfSE3nc3oM)\n\n###\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/NPCiUZ-MZGM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPCiUZ-MZGM)\n\n"
