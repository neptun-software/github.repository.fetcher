Ghostscript is required to render PDF files into images and Imagemagick is used to compare image data. \nThere are two options for running tests:\n1. Pass Ghostscript and Imagemagick compare commands as ITEXT_GS_EXEC and ITEXT_MAGICK_COMPARE_EXEC environment variables, respectively \n(Ghostscript and Imagemagick folders must be added to PATH environment variable). This option is suitable for both Windows and Unix systems. \nThe syntax of commands depends on installed Ghostscript and Imagemagick versions (`gs`, `gswin64c`, `magick compare`).\n2. Pass the paths to Ghostscript and Imagemagick compare execution files as ITEXT_GS_EXEC and ITEXT_MAGICK_COMPARE_EXEC \nenvironment variables. Examples of paths on Windows:\n- `C:\\Program Files\\gs\\gs9.26\\bin\\gswin64c.exe`\n- `C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick-7.0.9-Q16\\compare.exe`\n\nIf you have a new version of ImageMagick, then there is no compare.exe utility there, wrap the path to magick.exe in quotes and call compare command:\nITEXT_MAGICK_COMPARE_EXEC=`\"C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick-7.0.9-Q16\\magick.exe\" compare`\n\n\n# Deploying iText\n\nWhen using **iText Community** in a project and want to deploy it you have to consider a few things for different deployments.\n\n- **FrameworkDependend**: No additional parameters are required.\n- **SelfContained**: No additional parameters are required.\n- **PublishSingleFile**: When using `-p:PublishSingleFile=true` you will also need to add `-p:IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract=true`. This is important when using `hyph` or `font-asian` modules.\n- **AssemblyTrimming**: Using `-p:PublishTrimmed=true` is currently not supported.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.ghostscript.com/\n[2]: https://www.imagemagick.org/\n"

Providing the following information will increase the\nchances of your issue being dealt with quickly:\n\n* **[How to ask good questions][good-questions]**\n* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps\n* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you\n* **iText Version(s)** - is it a regression?\n* **Operating System** - is this a problem on Windows or Linux, maybe on Mac?\n* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a [Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example][sscce], also known as a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example][mcve].\n* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?\n* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be\n  causing the problem (line of code or commit)\n* **Tag the question** - add the tag `itext` to your question so we can find it.\n\n**If you get help, help others. Good karma rulez!**\n\n\n### Submitting a Pull Request\nBefore you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:\n\n* Search [GitHub][pull] for an open or closed Pull Request\n  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n* Verify that your proposed change hasn't already been addressed in the develop branch.\n* Don't send a separate pull request for every single file you change.  \n* Please sign the [iText Contributor License Agreement (iCLA)](#cla) before sending pull\n  requests. We cannot accept code without this agreement.\n* Fork the iText repository on GitHub.\n* Clone your iText fork to your local machine.\n* Make your changes, **including appropriate test cases**.\n* Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).\n* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\n  [commit message conventions](#commit-message-format).\n* Now would be a good time to fix up your commits (if you want or need to) with `git rebase --interactive`.\n* Build your changes locally to ensure all the tests pass.\n* Push your changes to your GitHub account.\n* Create a pull request in GitHub.\n\"Head fork\" should be your repository, and the \"base fork\" should be the iText official repository.\n* If we suggest changes then:\n  * Make the required updates.\n  * Fix up your commits if needed, with an interactive rebase.\n  * Re-run the tests and make sure that they are still passing.\n  * Force push to your GitHub repository. This will update your Pull Request.\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\n\n#### After your pull request is merged\n\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your fork and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository.\n\n\n## <a name=\"rules\">Coding Rules</a>\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\n* We develop in Java first, and then port to .NET, so code submissions in Java are preferred.\n  Nevertheless this shouldn't stop you from making a good pull request to the .NET port.\n* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more unit tests.\n* All public API methods **must be documented** with JavaDoc. To see how we document our APIs, please check\n  out the existing [javadocs][javadocs].\n* We follow the rules contained in\n  [Oracle's Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language][java-style-guide], with these additions:\n    * Wrap all code at **100 characters**.\n\n\n## <a name=\"commit\">Git Commit Guidelines</a>\n\nWe have guidelines on how our git commit messages should be formatted. This leads to **more\nreadable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to **generate the iText Community change log**.\n\nThese guidelines were taken from Chris Beams' blog post [How to Write a Git Commit Message][git-commit].\n\n### Commit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a **subject**, a **body** and a **footer**:\n\n```\n<subject>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<body>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<footer>\n```\n\nAny line of the commit message should not be longer 72 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\n\n### Subject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\n* [Separate subject from body with a blank line][git-commit-separate]\n* [Limit the subject line to 50 characters][git-commit-limit-50]\n* [Capitalize the subject line][git-commit-capitalize]\n* [Do not end the subject line with a period][git-commit-end]\n* [Use the imperative mood in the subject line][git-commit-imperative]\n\n### Body\n* [Wrap the body at 72 characters][git-commit-wrap-72]\n* [Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_][git-commit-why-not-how]\n\n### Footer\nThe footer contains any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to\nreference JIRA or GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.\n\n\n## <a name=\"cla\">Signing the iCLA</a>\n\nPlease sign the [**iText Contributor License Agreement (iCLA)**][cla] before sending pull requests. For any code changes to be accepted, the iCLA must be signed. It's a quick process, we promise!\n\nWe'll need you to [(digitally) sign and then email, fax or mail the form][cla].\n\n\n## <a name=\"coc\">Contributor Code of Conduct</a>\nPlease note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct][coc].

It is also available for [Java](https://github.com/itext/itext7).\n\n### The key features of iText Core/Community are:\n\n* Core library:\n    * PDF creation with the use of our layout engine\n    * PDF manipulation, e.g. merging multiple PDFs into one, adding new content, ...\n    * PDF digital signing\n    * PDF form creation and manipulation\n    * Working with PDF/A documents\n    * Working with PDF/UA documents\n    * FIPS-compliant cryptography\n    * Barcode generation\n    * SVG support\n* [Addons:][all products]\n    * Converting XML/HTML & CSS to PDF [repo][pdfhtml], [info][pdfhtmlproduct]\n    * Redacting sensitive information in PDF documents [repo][pdfsweep], [info][pdfsweepproduct]\n    * Support for international character sets (e.g. Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Thai, ...) [info][calligraph]\n    * Optimize PDF documents for reduced file size, and increased performance [info][optimizer]\n    * Flattening XFA documents [info][xfa]\n    * PDF debugging [repo][rups], [info][rupsproduct]\n\nWant to discover what's possible? Head over to our [Demo Lab](https://itextpdf.com/demos)! It contains a collection of\ndemo applications ready to use online!\n\n### Getting started\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to use NuGet, just execute the following install command in the folder of your\nproject:\n\n```shell\ndotnet add package itext --version <REPLACE_WITH_DESIRED_ITEXT_VERSION>\ndotnet add package itext.bouncy-castle-adapter --version <REPLACE_WITH_DESIRED_ITEXT_VERSION>\n```\n\nFor more advanced use cases, please refer to\nthe [Installation guidelines](https://kb.itextpdf.com/home/it7kb/installation-guidelines).\nYou can also [build iText Community from source][building].\n\n### Hello PDF!\n\nThe following example shows how easy it is to create a simple PDF document:\n\n```csharp\nusing iText.Kernel.Pdf;\nusing iText.Layout;\nusing iText.Layout.Element;\n\nnamespace HelloPdf {\n    class Program {\n        static void Main(string[] args) {\n            using var document = new Document(new PdfDocument(new PdfWriter(\"helloworld-pdf.pdf\")));\n            document.Add(new Paragraph(\"Hello World!\"));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nFor more advanced examples, refer to our [Knowledge Base](https://kb.itextpdf.com/home/it7kb/examples) or the\nmain [Examples repo](https://github.com/itext/i7ns-samples). You can find C# equivalents to the\nJava [Signing examples](https://github.com/itext/i7js-signing-examples) [here](https://github.com/itext/i7ns-samples/tree/develop/itext/itext.publications),\nthough the Java code is very similar since they have the same API.\n\nSome of the output PDF files will be incorrectly displayed by the GitHub previewer, so be sure to download them to see\nthe correct\nresults.\n\n| Description                                | Link

By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: **(1)** assert copyright on the software, and **(2)** offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\nA secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\nAn older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n## TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n### 0. Definitions\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and\n“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the\nearlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\n\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that **(1)** displays an appropriate copyright notice, and **(2)**\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n### 1. Source Code\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that **(a)** is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and **(b)** serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n### 2. Basic Permissions\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n* **a)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n* **b)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section 7.\nThis requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n“keep intact all notices”.\n* **c)** You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n* **d)** If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n* **a)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n* **b)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either **(1)** a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or **(2)** access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n* **c)** Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n* **d)** Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n* **e)** Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA “User Product” is either **(1)** a “consumer product”, which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or **(2)** anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n### 7. Additional Terms\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n* **a)** Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n* **b)** Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n* **c)** Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n* **d)** Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n* **e)** Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n* **f)** Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further\nrestrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n### 8. Termination\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated **(a)**\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and **(b)** permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n### 11. Patents\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.\n\nA contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To “grant” such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either **(1)** cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or **(2)** arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or **(3)** arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license **(a)** in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or **(b)** primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n### 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n### 14. Revised Versions of this License\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n### 16. Limitation of Liability\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n_END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS_\n\n## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a “Source” link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n&lt;<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>&gt;.\n"
