Before submitting the PR, please review this page for guidelines\n2. Dynamo Team will meet 1x a month to review PRs found on Github (Issues will be handled separately)\n3. PRs will be reviewed from oldest to newest\n4. If a reviewed PR requires changes by the owner, the owner of the PR has 30 days to respond. If the PR has seen no activity by the next session, it will be either closed by the team or depending on its utility will be taken over by someone on the team\n5. PRs should use either Dynamo's default PR template or [one of these other template options](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Choosing-a-Pull-Request-Template) in order to be considered for review.\n6. PRs that do not have one of the Dynamo PR templates completely filled out with all declarations satisfied will not be reviewed by the Dynamo team.\n7. PRs made to the `DynamoRevit` repo will need to be cherry-picked into all the DynamoRevit Release branches that Dynamo supports. Contributors will be responsible for cherry-picking their reviewed commits to the other branches after a `LGTM` label is added to the PR.\n\n## Filing issues\n\nWhen filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:\n\n1. Which version of Dynamo are you using (check the About box)?\n2. Which operating system are you using?\n3. What did you do?\n4. What did you expect to see?\n5. What did you see instead?\n\nGeneral questions about using Dynamo should be submitted to [the forum at dynamobim.org](http://dynamobim.org/forums/forum/dyn/)\n\n## Contributing code\n\nPlease see the [Pull request template guide](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Choosing-a-Pull-Request-Template)\nbefore submitting a pull request.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the Dynamo source files are distributed under\nthe Apache 2.0 License.\n\nContribution \"Bar\"\n------------------\n\nThe Dynamo team will merge changes that make it easier for customers to use Dynamo.\n\nThe Dynamo team will not merge changes that have narrowly-defined benefits. Contributions must also satisfy the other published guidelines defined in this document.\n\nDOs and DON'Ts\n--------------\n\nPlease do:\n\n* **DO** follow our [coding standards](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Coding-Standards) and [naming standards](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Naming-Standards)\n* **DO** include unit tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with\n  adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.\n* **DO** keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up\n  it's often better to create new issue than to side track the discussion.\n* **DO** blog and tweet (or whatever) about your contributions, frequently!\n\nPlease do not:\n\n* **DON'T** surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start\n  a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount\n  of time.\n* **DON'T** commit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit to add to Dynamo, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.\n* **DON'T** submit PRs that alter licensing related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.\n* **DON'T** add API additions without filing an issue and discussing with us first.\n\nManaged Code Compatibility\n--------------------------\n\nContributions must maintain API backwards compatibility following semantic versioning. Contributions that include breaking changes will be rejected. Please file an issue to discuss your idea or change if you believe that it may affect managed code compatibility.\n\nCommit Messages\n---------------\n\nPlease format commit messages as follows (based on [A Note About Git Commit Messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)):\n\n```\nSummarize change in 50 characters or less\n\nProvide more detail after the first line. Leave one blank line below the\nsummary and wrap all lines at 72 characters or less.\n\nIf the change fixes an issue, leave another blank line after the final\nparagraph and indicate which issue is fixed in the specific format\nbelow.\n\nFix #42\n```\n\nAlso do your best to factor commits appropriately, not too large with unrelated things in the same commit, and not too small with the same small change applied N times in N different commits.\n\nNotes\n---------------\nThis guide was based off of [DotNet Core Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/contributing.md)\n\n\n"

It gives users the ability to visually script behavior, define custom pieces of logic, and script using various textual programming languages.\n\n## Get Dynamo\n\nLooking to learn or download Dynamo? Check out [dynamobim.org](https://dynamobim.org/)!\n\n## Develop\n\n### Create a Node Library for Dynamo\n\nIf you're interested in developing a Node library for Dynamo, the easiest place to start is by browsing the [DynamoSamples](https://github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoSamples).\nThese samples use the [Dynamo NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=DynamoVisualProgramming) which can be installed using the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio.\n\n[Documentation of the Dynamo API via Fuget.org](https://www.fuget.org/packages/DynamoVisualProgramming.Core/) with a searchable index of public API calls for core functionality in the dynamo nuget packages. *WIP*.\n\nThe [API Changes](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/API-Changes) document explains changes made to the Dynamo API with every version.\n\nYou can learn more about developing libraries for Dynamo on the [Dynamo wiki](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Zero-Touch-Plugin-Development) or the [Developer page](https://developer.dynamobim.org/).\n\n### Build Dynamo from Source\n\nYou will need the following to build the latest Dynamo on Windows:\n\n- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (any edition)\n- [Microsoft .NET Framework 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (included with Visual Studio 2022)\n- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm\n\nIf you are working on legacy branches, you may need to install legacy .NET Framework versions through Visual Studio `Tools > Get Tools and Features...` or downloading from [the archive here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives).\n\nThe Dynamo user interface is Windows-only, but the Dynamo engine can be built for other platforms. [Directions for building Dynamo on Linux or OS X can be found here](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Dynamo-on-Linux,-Mac).\nFind more about how to build Dynamo at our [wiki](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki) and [Dynamo Developer Resources](https://developer.dynamobim.org/).\n\n## Contribute\n\nDynamo is an open source project and would be nothing without its community.\n\n- You can make suggestions or improvement requests via [Dynamo Wishlist](https://github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoWishlist/issues/new/choose).\n- You can submit and track bugs via [Dynamo Issues](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/issues/new/choose).\n- You can submit your own code to via a [pull request](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/pulls). For more info read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- If you have any questions, ideas or have something to share with the community, please visit us at [Dynamo Forum](https://forum.dynamobim.com).\n\n## Releases\n\nSee the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Release-Notes).\n\n## Instrumentation\n\nDynamo now leverages the same instrumentation component as other Autodesk products which share the opt-in option. The data will be used to enhance the usability of the product.\n\n## License\n\nDynamo is licensed under the Apache License. Dynamo also uses a number of third party libraries, some with different licenses. You can find more information [here](LICENSE.txt).\n"
