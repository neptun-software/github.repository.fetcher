(Postremus, #1402)\n- [GUI] Mods can be search by abbreviation by typing directly into the modlist, as well as the search bar. (Postremus, #1430)\n- [GUI] Mods can be filtered by locally cached status (Postremus, #1426)\n\n### Internal\n\n- [Updater] Checking for updates takes less network resources, and is more resilient to malformed release notes. (Postremus, #1410; pjf, #1453)\n- [Core] We now cache the results of cache look-ups (so you can cache while you cache... faster). (pjf, #1454)\n\n## v1.14.1 (Eris)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- [GUI] Re-ordering repositories in the settings panel is more stable. (Postremus, #1431)\n- [GUI] Fixed an unhandled exception that could occur when installing metapages via `Install -> From .ckan`. (Postremus, #1436)\n- [Core] Less likely to remove essential directories (such as `Ships/*`) if empty.

(Postremus, #1412)\n\n### Internal\n\n- [Netkan] `netkan.exe` will now report its version and exit if run with the `--version` switch. (pjf, #1415)\n\n## v1.14.0 (Mimas)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- [GUI] The CKAN client is less likely to believe that *all* mods are new when auto-updating metadata is enabled. (Postremus, #1369)\n- [GUI] The latest CKAN-available version of a mod is always shown in the 'latest' column, even if that mod is not compatible with the installed KSP version. (Postremus, #1396)\n- [GUI] Pressing a key with an empty modlist will no longer crash the client. (Postremus, #1329)\n- [GUI] The 'mark for update' button no longer highlights when the only upgrade candidates are autodetected mods we can't actually upgrade. (Postremus, #1392)\n- [Core] Installing from `.ckan` files (such as exported modlists) is more likely to succeed even when dependencies are complex. (#1337, Postremus)\n- [CLI] `ckan.exe --verbose` and `ckan.exe --debug` now start the GUI with the appropriate logging mode. (#1403, Postremus)\n- [Updater] We'll no longer try to download a CKAN release that hasn't finished building its assets yet. (Postremus, #1397)\n\n### Features\n\n- [GUI] Updates to the text of some buttons, and change the check mark from blue to green. (plague006, #1352)\n- [GUI] The main display shows the download size if known. (Postremus, #1399)\n- [GUI] Suggested and recommended mods can now be (de)selected with a single click. (martinnj, #1398)\n- [GUI] Mods can be searched by their abbreviation, which we generate by taking the first letter of each word in the title. For example, `KIS` will match `Kerbal Inventory System`. (Postremus, #1394)\n- [GUI] The side metadata panel and its elements can now be resized. (martinnj, #1378)\n- [GUI] Mod filters will no longer reset to 'compatible' each time the client is opened. (Postremus, #1384)\n- [GUI] The repository list no longer has weird numbers visible that we only use internally, and may eventually remove. (Postremus, #1393)\n\n### Internal\n\n- [Core] Additional tests against autodetected mods in the RelationshipResolver. (Postremus and pjf, #1226 and #1355)\n- [GUI] Removed a spurious warning when building. (pjf, #1343)\n- [Netkan] Reading of information from `.version` files greatly improved, especially when mixing metadata from other sources like github and kerbalstuff. (dbent, #1299)\n- [Core] Files can now be installed to `saves/scenarios` using the `Scenarios` target. (pjf, #1360)\n- [Spec] Grammar corrections. (Postremus, #1400)\n- [Netkan] Files produced by `netkan.exe` have more stable field ordering. (dbent, #1304)\n- [Netkan] `netkan.exe` can use regexps to manipulate version strings. (dbent, #1321)\n- [GUI] Refactoring to remove duplicated code. (Postremus, #1362)\n\n## v1.12.0 (Veil Nebula)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- [GUI] Hitting `cancel` is much more likely to actually cancel an install-in-progress (Postremus, #1325)\n- [GUI] Fewer crashes when double-clicking on an auto-detected mod (Postremus, #1237)\n- [CLI] `ckan compare` fails more gracefully when called without arguments (Postremus, #1283)\n- [CLI] `ckan show` more accurately displays the cached filename (mgsdk, #1266)\n- [Core] We fail more gracefully when mod metadata can't be downloaded (Postremus, #1291)\n\n### Features\n\n- [GUI] Installed mods can now be exported as a \"favourites list\" via `File -> Export Installed Mods`. Imported favourites lists allow the user to choose which mods they get, and will install the latest versions available for the user's version of KSP. (Postremus, #972)\n- [GUI] Enter and escape can be used to accept and cancel changes when editing the command-line dialog (Postremus, #1318)\n- [GUI] Yes/no dialog boxes have a more user-friendly title (plague006, #1312)\n- [GUI] Downloading a file to the cache shows the download in progress, and refreshes the contents viewer when complete (Postremus, #1231)\n- [GUI] On first start we always refresh the modlist, with an option to do so each time the CKAN is loaded (Postremus, #1285)\n- [Core] KSP instance names now default to the folder in which they're installed (Postremus, #1261)\n- [Core] Processing an updated mod list is now faster, and other speed enhancements (Postremus, #1229)\n- [Core] Metadata is now downloaded in `.tar.gz` rather than `.zip` format, resulting in much faster downloads (pjf, #1344)\n- [Spec] `install_to` can now target `Ships/` subdirectories (dbent, #1243)\n\n### Internal\n\n- [Netkan] Cached files have more descriptive file extensions (dbent, #1308)\n- [Netkan] A warning is generated if a file without a `.netkan` extension is processed (dbent, #1308)\n- [Netkan] We better handle null values in retrieved metadata (dbent, #1324)\n- [Netkan] Better handling of license strings with leading and trailing spaces (dbent, #1305)\n- [Core] We no longer try to use `libcurl` on systems where the .NET web classes are sufficient (dbent, #1294)\n"

Please open discussions in the issues list, and\nsend pull requests to patch this document and associated files.\n\nThis document, and all associated files, are licensed under the MIT/Expat\nlicense.\n\nThe key words \"*must*\", \"*must not*\", \"*required*\", \"*shall*\",\n\"*shall not*\", \"*should*\", \"*should not*\", \"*recommended*\", \"*may*\" and\n\"*optional*\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in\n[RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere have been many comprehensive archive networks for various\nlanguages and platforms. While the original network was for TeX\n(the CTAN), the most successful has been for Perl (the CPAN),\nwith over 11,000 contributors and 30,000 distributions.\n\nThe goal of the CKAN is to provide a network that is easy to use\nfor both mod authors and end users. By providing a standardised way\nto release and install modules, it is hoped that many of the misinstall\nproblems will be eliminated (reducing the workload on authors), and\na more straightforward path of installing mods is provided (making\nit easier for users to use mods).\n\n## Design\n\nThe fundamental design of the CKAN is as follows:\n\n- Each *distribution* (a mod and its associated files) *must* have an\n  associated meta-data file that describes its contents.\n- The meta-data file *must* be detachable from the distribution\n  itself. This facilities easy building of indexes, and means meta-data\n  can be created independently of the distribution itself, easing\n  adoption by authors.\n- The meta-data file *may* be included in the distribution, to facilitate\n  easier indexing. CKAN files may be placed anywhere inside a distribution.\n- It is an error for a distribution (zipfile) to contain more than one\n  CKAN file.\n\nPresently the authoritative CKAN metadata repository is\n[hosted on github](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN-meta).\n\n## Validation\n\nA [JSON Schema](CKAN.schema) is provided for validation purposes.\nAny CKAN file *must* conform to this schema to be considered valid.\n\n## The CKAN file\n\nA CKAN file is designed to contain all the relevant meta-info\nabout a mod, including its name, license, download location,\ndependencies, compatible versions of KSP, and the like. CKAN\nfiles are simply JSON files using UTF-8 as character-encoding.\n\nExcept where stated otherwise all strings *should* be printable unicode only.\n\nCKAN files *should* have a naming scheme of their mod's identifier,\nfollowed by a dash, followed by the version number, followed by\nthe extension `.ckan`. For example: `RealSolarSystem-7.3.ckan`.\n\nThe CKAN metadata spec is inspired by the\n[CPAN metadata spec](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec),\nthe [Debian Policy Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/)\nand the\n[KSP-RealSolarSystem-Bundler](https://github.com/NathanKell/KSP-RealSolarSystem-Bundler)\n\n### Example CKAN file\n\n```json\n    {\n        \"spec_version\"   : 1,\n        \"name\"           : \"Advanced Jet Engine (AJE)\",\n        \"abstract\"       : \"Realistic jet engines for KSP\",\n        \"identifier\"     : \"AJE\",\n        \"download\"       : \"https://github.com/camlost2/AJE/archive/1.6.zip\",\n        \"license\"        : \"LGPL-2.1\",\n        \"version\"        : \"1.6\",\n        \"release_status\" : \"stable\",\n        \"ksp_version\"    : \"0.25\",\n        \"resources\" : {\n            \"homepage\"     : \"https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=139868\",\n            \"repository\"   : \"https://github.com/camlost2/AJE\"\n        },\n        \"tags\" : [\n            \"physics\",\n            \"resources\",\n            \"atmospheric\",\n            \"engines\",\n            \"nasa-enginesim\",\n            \"b9-turbofans\"\n        ],\n        \"install\" : [\n            {\n                \"file\"       : \"AJE-1.6\",\n                \"install_to\" : \"GameData\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"depends\" : [\n            { \"name\" : \"FerramAerospaceResearch\" },\n            { \"name\" : \"ModuleManager\", \"min_version\" : \"2.3.5\" }\n        ],\n        \"recommends\" : [\n            { \"name\" : \"RealFuels\" },\n            { \"name\" : \"HotRockets\" }\n        ]\n    }\n```\n\n### Metadata description\n\nThe metadata file provides machine-readable information about a\ndistribution.\n\n#### Mandatory fields\n\n##### spec_version\n\nThe version number of the CKAN specification used to create this .ckan file.\n\nA `vx.x` string (eg: `\"v1.2\"`), being the minimum version of the\nreference CKAN client that will read this file.\n\nFor compatibility with pre-release clients, and the v1.0 client, the special\n*integer* `1` should be used.\n\nThis document describes the CKAN specification 'v1.34'. Changes since spec `1`\nare marked with **v1.2** through to **v1.34** respectively. For maximum\ncompatibility, using older spec versions is preferred when newer features are\nnot required.\n\n##### identifier\n\nThis is the globally unique identifier for the mod, and is how the mod\nwill be referred to by other CKAN documents. It may only consist of ASCII-letters, ASCII-digits and `-` (dash). Eg: \"FAR\" or\n\"RealSolarSystem\". This is the identifier that will be used whenever\nthe mod is referenced (by `depends`, `conflicts`, or elsewhere).\n\nIdentifiers must be both: case sensitive for machines, and unique regardless of capitalization for human consumption and case-ignorant systems. Example: MyMod must always be expressed as MyMod, but another module\ncannot assume the mymod identifier.\n\nIf the mod would generate a `FOR` pass in ModuleManager, then the\nidentifier *should* be same as the ModuleManager name. For most mods,\nthis means the identifier *should* be the name of the directory in\n`GameData` in which the mod would be installed, or the name of the `.dll`\nwith any version and the `.dll` suffix removed.\n\n##### name\n\nThis is the human readable name of the mod, and may contain any\nprintable characters. Eg: \"Ferram Aërospace Research (FAR)\",\n\"Real Solar System\".\n\n##### abstract\n\nA short, one line description of the mod and what it does.\n\n##### author\n\nThe author, or list of authors, for this mod. No restrictions are\nplaced upon this field.\n\nThis field was optional prior to **v1.28**, but this was more of an oversight\nthan an intentional design decision. It should always have been populated,\nbut the client didn't always enforce this.\n\n##### download\n\nA fully formed URL, indicating where a machine may download the\ndescribed version of the mod. Note: This field is not required if the `kind` is `metapackage`\nor `dlc`.\n\nMay also be an array of URLs (**v1.34**), any of which may be used to\ndownload the mod.\n\n##### license\n\nThe license (**v1.0**), or list of licenses (**v1.8**), under which the mod is released.\nThe same rules as per the\n[Debian license specification](https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/#license-specification) apply, with the following modifications:\n\n- The `MIT` license is always taken to mean the [Expat license](https://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/mit).\n- The creative commons licenses are permitted without a version number, indicating the\n  author did not specify which version applies.\n- Stripping of trailing zeros is not recognised.\n- (**v1.2**) `WTFPL` is recognised as a valid license.\n- (**v1.18**) `Unlicense` is recognised as a valid license.\n\nThe following license strings are also valid and indicate other licensing not\ndescribed above:\n\n- `open-source`: Other Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license\n- `restricted`: Requires special permission from copyright holder\n- `unrestricted`: Not an OSI approved license, but not restricted\n- `unknown`: License not provided in metadata\n\nA single license (**v1.0**) , or list of licenses (**v1.8**) may be provided. The following\nare both valid, the first describing a mod released under the BSD license,\nthe second under the *user's choice* of BSD-2-clause or GPL-2.0 licenses.\n\n```json\n    \"license\" : \"BSD-2-clause\"\n\n    \"license\" : [ \"BSD-2-clause\", \"GPL-2.0\" ]\n```\n\nIf different assets in the mod have different licenses, the *most restrictive*\nlicense should be specified, which may be `restricted`.\n\nA future version of the spec may provide for per-file licensing declarations.\n\n##### version\n\nThe version of the mod. Versions have the format `[epoch:]mod_version`.\n\n###### epoch\n\n`epoch` is a single (generally small) unsigned integer. It may be omitted, in\nwhich case zero is assumed.\n\nIt is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers of older versions of a\npackage, and also a package's previous version numbering schemes, to be left\nbehind.\n\n###### mod_version\n\n`mod_version` is the main part of the version number. It is usually the version\nnumber of the original mod from which the CKAN file is created. Usually this\nwill be in the same format as that specified by the mod author(s); however, it\nmay need to be reformatted to fit into the package management system's format\nand comparison scheme.\n\nThe comparison behavior of the package management system with respect to the\n`mod_version` is described below. The `mod_version` portion of the version\nnumber is mandatory.\n\nWhile the CKAN will accept *any* string as a `mod_version`, mod authors are\nencouraged to restrict version names to ASCII-letters, ASCII-digits, and the characters `.` `+` `-` `_`\n(full stop, plus, dash, underscore) and should start with a digit.\n\n###### Version ordering\n\nWhen comparing two version numbers, first the `epoch` of each are compared, then\nthe `mod_version` if `epoch` is equal. `epoch` is compared numerically. The\n`mod_version` part is compared by the package management system using the\nfollowing algorithm:\n\nThe strings are compared from left to right.\n\nFirst the initial part of each string consisting entirely of non-digit\ncharacters is determined. These two parts (one of which may be empty) are\ncompared lexically. If a difference is found it is returned. The lexical\ncomparison is a comparison of ASCII values modified so that all the letters sort\nearlier than all the non-letters.\n\nThen the initial part of the remainder of each string which consists entirely of\ndigit characters is determined. The numerical values of these two parts are\ncompared, and any difference found is returned as the result of the\ncomparison. For these purposes an empty string (which can only occur at the end\nof one or both version strings being compared) counts as zero.\n\nThese two steps (comparing and removing initial non-digit strings and initial\ndigit strings) are repeated until a difference is found or both strings are\nexhausted.\n\nNote that the purpose of epochs is to allow us to leave behind mistakes in\nversion numbering, and to cope with situations where the version numbering\nscheme changes. It is not intended to cope with version numbers containing\nstrings of letters which the package management system cannot interpret (such as\nALPHA or pre-), or with silly orderings.\n\n#### Optional fields\n\n##### install\n\nA list of install directives for this mod, each *must* contain exactly one of\nthree source directives:\n\n- `file`: The file or directory root that this directive pertains to.\n  All leading directories are stripped from the start of the filename\n  during install. (Eg: `MyMods/KSP/Foo` will be installed into\n  `GameData/Foo`.)\n- `find`: (**v1.4**) Locate the top-most directory which exactly matches\n  the name specified. This is particularly useful when distributions\n  have structures which change based upon each release.\n- `find_regexp`: (**v1.10**) Locate the top-most directory which matches\n  the specified regular expression. This is particularly useful when\n  distributions have structures which change based upon each release, but\n  `find` cannot be used because multiple directories or files contain the\n  same name. Directories separators will have been normalised to\n  forward-slashes first, and the trailing slash for each directory removed\n  before the regular expression is run.\n  *Use sparingly and with caution*, it's *very* easy to match the wrong\n  thing with a regular expression.\n\nIn addition a destination directive *must* be provided:\n\n- `install_to`: The target location where the matched file or directory should be installed.\n  - Valid values for this entry for KSP1 mods are `GameData`, `Missions`(**v1.25**), `Ships`, `Ships/SPH`(**v1.12**), `Ships/VAB`(**v1.12**), `Ships/@thumbs/VAB`(**v1.16**), `Ships/@thumbs/SPH`(**v1.16**), `Ships/Script`(**v1.29**), `Tutorial`, `Scenarios` (**v1.14**),\n  and `GameRoot` (which should be used sparingly, if at all).\n  - Valid values for this entry for KSP2 mods are `GameRoot`, `BepInEx/plugins` (**v1.32**), and `GameData/Mods` (**v1.33**)\n  - A path to a given subfolder location can be specified *only* under `GameData` (**v1.2**);\n  for example: `GameData/MyMod/Plugins`. The client *must* check this path and abort the install\n  if any attempts to traverse up directories are found (eg: `GameData/../Example`).\n  - Subfolder paths under a matched directory will be preserved, but directories will *only*\n  be created when installing to `GameData`, `Tutorial`, or `Scenarios`.\n\nIn addition, any number of optional directives *may* be provided:\n\n- `as` : (**v1.18**) The name to give the matching directory or file when installed. Allows renaming directories or\n  files.\n- `filter` : A string, or list of strings, of file parts that should *not*\n  be installed. These are treated as literal things which must match a\n  file name or directory. Examples of filters may be `Thumbs.db`,\n  or `Source`. Filters are considered case-insensitive.\n- `filter_regexp` : (**v1.10**) A string, or list of strings, which are treated as\n  case-sensitive C# regular expressions which are matched against the\n  full paths from the installing zip-file. If a file matches the regular\n  expression, it is *not* installed.\n- `include_only` : (**v1.24**) A string, or list of strings, of file parts that should\n  be installed. These are treated as literal things which must match a\n  file name or directory. Examples of this may be `Settings.cfg`,\n  or `Plugin`. These are considered case-insensitive.\n- `include_only_regexp` : (**v1.24**) A string, or list of strings, which are treated as\n  case-sensitive C# regular expressions which are matched against the\n  full paths from the installing zip-file. If a file matches the regular\n  expression, it is installed.\n- `find_matches_files` : (**v1.16**) If set to `true` then both `find` and\n  `find_regexp` will match files in addition to directories.\n\nIf no install sections are provided, a CKAN client *must* find the\ntop-most directory in the archive that matches the module identifier,\nand install that with a target of `GameData`. In other words, the\ndefault install section is:\n\n```json\n    \"install\": [\n        {\n            \"find\": \"<identifier>\",\n            \"install_to\": \"GameData\"\n        }\n    ]\n```\n\n##### comment\n\nA comment field, if included, is ignored. It is not displayed to users,\nnor used by programs. Its primary use is to convey information to humans\nexamining the CKAN file manually\n\n##### description\n\nA free form, long text description of the mod, suitable for displaying detailed information about the mod.\n\n##### release_status\n\nThe release status of the mod, one of `stable`, `testing` or `development`,\nin order of decreasing stability.  If not specified, a value of `stable` is\nassumed.\n\n##### ksp_version\n\nThe version of KSP this mod is targeting. This may be the string \"any\",\na number (eg: `0.23.5`) or may only contain the first two parts of\nthe version string (eg: `0.25`). In the latter case, any release\nstarting with the `ksp_version` is considered acceptable.\n\nIf no KSP target version is included, a default of \"any\" is assumed.\n\n##### ksp_version_min\n\nThe minimum version of KSP the mod requires to operate correctly.\nSame format as `ksp_version`. It is an error to include both this\nand the `ksp_version` field.\n\n##### ksp_version_max\n\nThe maximum version of KSP the mod requires to operate correctly.\nSame format as `ksp_version`. It is an error to include both this\nand the `ksp_version` field.\n\n##### ksp_version_strict\n\n(**v1.16**)\n\nIf `true`, the mod will only be installed if the user's KSP version is\nexactly targeted by the mod.\n\nIf `false`, the mod will be installed if the KSP version it targets is\n\"generally recognised\" as being compatible with the KSP version\nthe user has installed. It is up to the CKAN client to determine what is\n\"generally recognised\" as working.\n\nAs an example, a mod with a `ksp_version` of `1.0.3` will also install in\nKSP `1.0.4` (but not any other version) when `ksp_version_strict` is false.\n\nThis field defaults to `false`, including for `spec_version`s less than\n`v1.16`, however CKAN clients prior to `v1.16` would only perform strict\nchecking.\n\n##### tags\n\n(**v1.27**) The `tags` field describes keywords that a user or program may\nuse to classify or filter the mod in a list. These may include general tags\nwhich define how the mod interacts with or alters KSP or specific tags\ndefining what has been added or changed from stock gameplay. Tags may\ncontain lowercase alphanumeric characters or hyphens.\n\nAll mods should have tags, but it is technically allowed to omit them to\nallow historical metadata to remain valid.\n\nA mod's tags are shown in the mod info section of the client, and the mod\nlist may be filtered to find all mods with a given tag.\n\nExample tags:\n\n```json\n    \"tags\": [\n        \"config\",\n        \"physics\",\n        \"parts\",\n        \"science\"\n    ]\n```\n\nCurrently recommended tags are listed here:\n\n<https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki/Suggested-Tags>\n\n##### localizations\n\n(**v1.27**)\n\nA list of strings indicating the locales for which this module includes localizations, in KSP's naming convention.\n\n```json\n    \"localizations\": [\n        \"en-us\",\n        \"es-es\",\n        \"fr-fr\",\n        \"zh-cn\",\n        \"ru\"\n    ]\n```\n\n##### download_size\n\nIf supplied, `download_size` is the number of bytes to expect when\ndownloading from the `download` URL. It is recommended that this field is\nonly generated by automated tools (where it is encouraged),\nand not filled in by hand.\n\n##### download_hash\n\nIf supplied, `download_hash` is an object of hash digests of the downloaded file.\nClients up to **v1.34** require both `sha1` and `sha256` to be populated, but\nlater clients allow either or both to be omitted.\nIt is recommended that this field is only generated by automated\ntools (where it is encouraged), and not filled in by hand.\n\n```json\n    \"download_hash\": {\n        \"sha256\": \"E3B0C44298FC1C149AFBF4C8996FB92427AE41E4649B934CA495991B7852B855\"\n    }\n```\n\n##### download_content_type\n\nIf supplied, `download_content_type` is the content type of the file\ndownloaded from the `download` URL. It is recommended that this field is\nonly generated by automated tools (where it is encouraged),\nand not filled in by hand.\n\n```json\n    \"download_content_type\": \"application/zip\"\n```\n\n##### install_size\n\nIf supplied, `install_size` is the number of bytes consumed by the module\nwhen it is installed. It is recommended that this field is only generated\nby automated tools (where it is encouraged), and not filled in by hand.\n\n##### release_date\n\nIf supplied, `release_date` is the timestamp when the described version\nof the mod was released. The format is ISO 8601.\n\n```json\n    \"release_date\": \"2019-11-30T14:54:45.995Z\",\n```\n\n#### Relationships\n\nRelationships are optional fields which describe this mod's relationship\nto other mods. They can be used to ensure that a mod is installed with\none of its graphics packs, or two mods with conflicting functionality\nare not installed at the same time.\n\nAt its most basic, this is an array of objects, each being a name\nand identifier:\n\n```json\n    \"depends\" : [\n        { \"name\" : \"ModuleManager\" },\n        { \"name\" : \"RealFuels\" },\n        { \"name\" : \"RealSolarSystem\" }\n    ]\n```\n\nEach relationship is an array of entries, each entry *must*\nhave a `name`.\n\nThe optional fields `min_version`, `max_version`,\nand `version`, may more precisely describe which versions are needed:\n\n```json\n    \"depends\" : [\n        { \"name\" : \"ModuleManager\",   \"min_version\" : \"2.1.5\" },\n        { \"name\" : \"RealSolarSystem\", \"min_version\" : \"7.3\"   },\n        { \"name\" : \"RealFuels\" }\n    ]\n```\n\nIt is an error to mix `version` (which specifies an exact version) with\neither `min_version` or `max_version` in the same object.\n\n(**v1.0**) Clients implementing versions of the spec older than `v1.8`\n*must* allow for the optional version fields to be present, but *may* choose\nto treat them as if they were absent. (**v1.8**) Clients implementing the\n`v1.8` spec and above *must* respect the optional version fields if\npresent.\n\n(**v1.26**) Clients implementing version `v1.26` or later of the spec *must* support\nan alternate form of relationship consisting of an `any_of` key with a\nvalue containing an array of relationships. This relationship is considered\nsatisfied if **any** of the specified modules are installed. It is intended for\nsituations in which a module supports multiple ways of providing functionality,\nwhich are not in themselves mutually compatible enough to use the `\"provides\"` property.\n\n```json\n    \"depends\": [\n        {\n            \"any_of\": [\n                { \"name\": \"TextureReplacer\"          },\n                { \"name\": \"TextureReplacerReplaced\"  },\n                { \"name\": \"SigmaReplacements-Skybox\" },\n                { \"name\": \"DiRT\"                     }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n```\n\n(**v1.31**) Clients implementing version `v1.31` or later of the spec *must* support\nthe `choice_help_text` property in a relationship. This string is presented to the user\nif they must be prompted to choose between two or more mods to satisfy the relationship.\n\n```yaml\ndepends:\n  - name: VirtualIdentifier1\n    choice_help_text: Choose the HR option for high resolution\n  - any_of:\n    - name: ModA\n    - name: ModB\n    choice_help_text: Pick ModA if you prefer polka dots, ModB otherwise\n```\n\n(**v1.34**) Clients implementing version `v1.34` or later of the spec *must* support\nthe `suppress_recommendations` property in a relationship. If this property is `true`,\nthen recommendations or suggestions will not be shown for the module satisfying this\nrelationship or its (sole) dependencies.\n\n```yaml\ndepends:\n  - name: OtherMod\n    suppress_recommendations: true\n```\n\nIn the interest of the end-user experience, the relationship metadata\n*should* only be used when a game-related relationship exists between\nthe mods. They do not have to directly interact, but the rationale should be\napparent. It *should not* be used purely for promotional purposes. This is\nconsistent with [the Debian spec], which states:\n\n> tells the ... user that the listed packages are related to this one and can\nperhaps enhance its usefulness\n\n[the Debian spec]: https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html\n\n##### depends\n\nA list of mods which are *required* for the current mod to operate.\nThese mods *must* be installed along with the current mod being installed.\n\n##### recommends\n\nA list of mods which are *recommended*, but not required, for a typical\nuser. This is a strong recommendation, and recommended mods *will* be installed\nunless the user requests otherwise.\n\n##### suggests\n\nA list of mods which are suggested for installation alongside this mod.\nThis is a weak recommendation, and by default these mods *will not* be\ninstalled unless the user requests otherwise.\n\n##### supports\n\n(**v1.2**) A list of mods which are supported by this mod.  This is the reverse\nof `suggests` - when a supported mod is installed, this mod *may* also be\noffered for installation.  This is equivalent to the [enhances specifier from\nDebian](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html).\n\n##### conflicts\n\nA list of mods which *conflict* with this mod. The current mod\n*will not* be installed if any of these mods are already on the system.\n\n##### replaced_by\n\n(**v1.26**) This is a way to mark a specific mod identifier as being\nobsoleted and tell the client what it has been *replaced by*. It contains a\nsingle mod that should be selected for installation if a replace command is\nperformed on this mod, while this mod is uninstalled. If this mod identifier\nis brought back to life, an epoch change should be applied. A *replaced_by*\nrelationship should be added to the final release of the mod being replaced.\nThe listed mod should include a \"provides\" relationship either to this mod,\nor one of this mod's listed \"provides\".\n\nreplaced_by differs from other relationships in two ways:\n\n- It is *not* an array. Only a single mod can be defined as the replacement.\n- Only \"version\" and \"min_version\" are permitted as options.\n\n#### Resources\n\nThe `resources` field describes additional information that a user or\nprogram may wish to know about the mod, but which are not required\nfor its installation or indexing. Presently the following fields\nare described. Unless specified otherwise, these are URLs:\n\n- `homepage` : The preferred landing page for the mod.\n- `bugtracker` : The mod's bugtracker if it exists.\n- `discussions` : The mod's discussions page if it exists.\n- `license` : The mod's license.\n- `repository` : The repository where the module source can be found.\n- `ci` :  (**v1.6**) Continuous Integration (e.g. Jenkins) Server where the module is being built. `x_ci` is an alias used in netkan.\n- `spacedock` : The mod on SpaceDock.\n- `curse` :  (**v1.20**) The mod on Curse.\n- `manual` : The mod's manual, if it exists.\n- `metanetkan` :  (**v1.27**) URL of the module's remote hosted netkan\n- `remote-avc` : URL of remote version file. If set in the netkan file, will be used to find the online copy of the version file. Otherwise the `URL` property from the internal version file will be assigned to this field and used instead.\n- `remote-swinfo` : URL of remote `swinfo.json` file. The `version_check` property from the internal `swinfo.json` file will be assigned to this field.\n- `store`:  (**v1.28**) URL where you can purchase a DLC\n- `steamstore`:  (**v1.28**) URL where you can purchase a DLC on Steam\n\nExample resources:\n\n```json\n    \"resources\" : {\n        \"homepage\"     : \"https://tinyurl.com/DogeCoinFlag\",\n        \"bugtracker\"   : \"https://github.com/pjf/DogeCoinFlag/issues\",\n        \"repository\"   : \"https://github.com/pjf/DogeCoinFlag\",\n        \"ci\"           : \"https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/DogecoinFlag\",\n        \"spacedock\"    : \"https://spacedock.info/mod/269/Dogecoin%20Flag\",\n        \"curse\"        : \"https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/220221\"\n    }\n```\n\nWhile all currently defined resources are URLs, future revisions of the spec may provide for more complex types.\n\nIt is permissible to have fields prefixed with an `x_`. These are considered\ncustom use fields, and will be ignored. For example:\n\n```json\n    \"x_twitter\" : \"https://twitter.com/pjf\"\n```\n\n#### Special use fields\n\nThese fields are optional, and should only be used with good reason.\nTypical mods *should not* include these special use fields.\n\n##### kind\n\nSpecifies the type of package the .ckan file represents. Allowed values:\n\n- `package` or empty - the default, a normal installable module\n- `metapackage` - a distributable .ckan file that has relationships to other mods while having no `download` of its own. **v1.6**\n- `dlc` - A paid expansion from SQUAD, which CKAN can detect but not install. Also has no `download`. **v1.28**\n\n##### provides\n\nA list of identifiers, that this module *provides*. This field\nis intended for use in modules which require one of a selection of texture\ndownloads, or one of a selection of mods which provide equivalent\nfunctionality.  For example:\n\n```json\n    \"provides\"  : [ \"RealSolarSystemTextures\" ]\n```\n\nIt is recommended that this field be used *sparingly*, as all mods with\nthe same `provides` string are essentially declaring they can be used\ninterchangeably.\n\nIt *is* considered acceptable to use this field if a mod is renamed,\nand the old name of the mod is listed in the `provides` field. This\nallows for mods to be renamed without updating all other mods which\ndepend upon it.\n\nA module may both provide functionality, and `conflict` with the same\nfunctionality. This allows relationships that ensure only one set\nof assets are installed. (Eg: `CustomBiomesRSS` and `CustomBiomesKerbal`\nboth provide and conflict with `CustomBiomesData`, ensuring that both\ncannot be installed at the same time.)\n\n#### Extensions\n\nAny field starting with `x_` (an x, followed by an underscore) is considered\nan *extension field*. The CKAN tool-chain will *ignore* any such fields.\nThese fields may be used to include additional machine or human-readable\ndata in the files.\n\nFor example, one may have an `x_maintained_by` field, to indicate the\nmaintainer of a CKAN file, or an `x_generated_by` field to indicate\nit's the result of a custom build process.\n\nExtension fields are unrestricted, and may contain any sort of data,\nincluding lists and objects.\n\n#### NetKAN Fields\n\nNetKAN is the name the tool which is used to automatically generate CKAN files from a variety of sources. NetKAN\nconsumes `.netkan` files to produce `.ckan` files. `.netkan` files are a *strict superset* of `.ckan` files. Every\n`.ckan` file is a valid `.netkan` file but not vice versa. NetKAN uses the following fields to produce `.ckan` files.\n\nIf a mod is hosted on multiple servers, a `.netkan` file may contain multiple metadata documents\n(separated by `---` in YAML or separate top-level `{}` object blocks in JSON), one per server.\nThese will all be checked for new releases and the results merged based on the value of their `version` properties,\nresulting in a `download` property containing an array of multiple download URLs.\n\nA [JSON Schema](NetKAN.schema) is provided for validation purposes.\nAny .netkan file *must* conform to this schema to be considered valid.\n\n##### YAML Option\n\nA `.netkan` file may be in either JSON or YAML format. All examples shown below assume YAML, but the JSON equivalents will work the same way.\n\nNote that `#` is the comment character in YAML, so even if you choose YAML syntax, you still can't omit the quotes around a value that includes `#`, such as typical values of `$kref` and `$vref`:\n\n```yaml\n$kref: \"#/ckan/spacedock/1234\"\n$vref: \"#/ckan/ksp-avc\"\n```\n\n##### Internal `.ckan` files\n\nIf a module's download contains a file with a `.ckan` extension, this file will be parsed and its contents added to the module's metadata. This can be a convenient way to handle metadata values that can change from one version to the next, such as dependencies.\n\nAn internal `.ckan` file may be in either JSON or YAML format.\n\n##### `$kref`\n\nThe `$kref` field indicates that data should be filled in from an external service provider. The following `$kref`\nvalues are understood. Only *one* `$kref` field may be present in a `.netkan` file.\n\n###### `#/ckan/spacedock/:sdid`\n\nIndicates that data should be fetched from SpaceDock, using the `:sdid` provided. For example: `#/ckan/spacedock/269`.\n\nWhen used, the following fields will be auto-filled if not already present:\n\n- `name`\n- `license`\n- `abstract`\n- `author`\n- `version`\n- `download`\n- `download_size`\n- `download_hash`\n- `download_content_type`\n- `resources.homepage`\n- `resources.spacedock`\n- `resources.repository`\n- `resources.bugtracker`\n- `resources.x_screenshot`\n- `ksp_version`\n- `release_date`\n- `release_status`\n\n###### `#/ckan/curse/:cid`\n\nThe Curse API that we used to use was sunsetted, so Curse is no longer supported.\n\n<details><summary>Expand to see the old info</summary>\n\nIndicates that data should be fetched from Curse, using the `:cid` provided. The `:cid` may be a number for modules indexed prior to March 2018, or the name from the Curse URL otherwise. For example: `#/ckan/curse/220221` or `#/ckan/curse/photonsail`.\n\nWhen used, the following fields will be auto-filled if not already present:\n\n- `name`\n- `license`\n- `author`\n- `version`\n- `download`\n- `download_size`\n- `download_hash`\n- `download_content_type`\n- `resources.curse`\n- `ksp_version`\n\n</details>\n\n###### `#/ckan/github/:user/:repo[(/asset_match/:filter_regexp)|(/version_from_asset/:version_regexp)]`\n\nIndicates that data should be fetched from GitHub, using the `:user` and `:repo` provided.\nFor example: `#/ckan/github/pjf/DogeCoinFlag`.\n\nWhen used, the following fields will be auto-filled if not already present:\n\n- `name`\n- `license` (**v1.26**)\n- `abstract`\n- `author`\n- `version`\n- `download`\n- `download_size`\n- `download_hash`\n- `download_content_type`\n- `resources.repository`\n- `resources.bugtracker`\n- `release_date`\n- `release_status`\n\nOptionally, one of `asset_match` with `:filter_regexp` *or* `version_from_asset` with `:version_regexp` *may* be provided:\n\n- `asset_match` with `filter_regexp`: A string which is treated as case-sensitive C# regular expressions which are matched against the\n  name of the released artifact.\n- `version_from_asset` with `:version_regexp`: A string which is treated as case-sensitive C# regular expressions which are matched\n  against the names of all release artifacts. Every matching artifact will result in a separate metadata output. The `:version_regexp`\n  must have a named capturing group `version`, which is used as the `version` of each asset's module.\n\nAn example `.netkan` excerpt:\n\n```yaml\n$kref: '#/ckan/github/pjf/DogeCoinFlag/version_from_asset/^DogeCoinFlag-(?<version>.+).zip$'\n```\n\nAn `x_netkan_github` field may be provided to customize how the metadata is fetched from GitHub. It is an `object` with the following fields:\n\n- `use_source_archive` (type: `boolean`) (default: `false`)<br/>\n  Specifies that the source ZIP of the repository itself will be used instead of any assets in the release.\n- `prereleases` (type: `boolean`) (default: `null`)<br/>\n  Skip prereleases if `false`, skip regular releases if `true`, use both if absent.\n\n###### `#/ckan/gitlab/:user/:repo`\n\nIndicates that data should be fetched from GitLab, using the `:user` and `:repo` provided.\nFor example: `#/ckan/gitlab/Ailex-/starilex-mk1-iva`.\n\nWhen used, the following fields will be auto-filled if not already present:\n\n- `name`\n- `abstract`\n- `author`\n- `version`\n- `resources.repository`\n- `resources.bugtracker`\n- `resources.manual`\n- `download`\n- `download_size`\n- `download_hash`\n- `download_content_type`\n- `release_date`\n\nAn example `.netkan` excerpt:\n\n```yaml\n$kref: '#/ckan/gitlab/Ailex-/starilex-mk1-iva'\n```\n\nAn `x_netkan_gitlab` field must be provided to customize how the metadata is fetched from GitLab. It is an `object` with the following fields:\n\n- `use_source_archive` (type: `boolean`) (default: `false`)<br/>\n  Specifies that the source ZIP of the release will be used instead of any discrete assets.<br/>\n  Note that this must be `true`! GitLab only offers source ZIP assets, so we can only index mods that use them. If at some point in the future GitLab adds support for non-source assets, we will be able to add support for setting this property to `false` or omitting it.\n\n###### `#/ckan/sourceforge/:repo`\n\nIndicates that data should be fetched from SourceForge using the `:repo` provided.\nFor example: `'#/ckan/sourceforge/ksre`\n\nWhen used, the following fields will be auto-filled if not already present:\n\n- `name`\n- `resources.homepage`\n- `resources.repository`\n- `resources.bugtracker`\n- `download`\n- `download_size`\n- `download_hash`\n- `download_content_type`\n- `release_date`\n\nAn example `.netkan` excerpt:\n\n```yaml\n$kref: '#/ckan/sourceforge/ksre'\n```\n\n###### `#/ckan/jenkins/:joburl`\n\nIndicates that data should be fetched from a [Jenkins CI server](https://jenkins-ci.org/) using the `:joburl` provided. For\nexample: `#/ckan/jenkins/https://jenkins.kspmods.example/job/AwesomeMod/`.\n\nThe following fields will be auto-filled if not already present:\n\n- `version`\n- `download`\n- `download_size`\n- `download_hash`\n- `download_content_type`\n- `resources.ci`\n- `release_date`\n\nAn `x_netkan_jenkins` field may be provided to customize how the metadata is fetched from the Jenkins server. It is\nan `object` with the following fields:\n\n- `build` (type: `string`, enumerated) (default: `\"stable\"`)<br/>\n   Specifies the type of build to use. Possible values are `\"any\"`, `\"completed\"`, `\"failed\"`, `\"stable\"`,\n   `\"successful\"`, `\"unstable\"`, or `\"unsuccessful\"`. Many of these values do not make sense to use in practice but\n   are provided for completeness.\n- `asset_match` (type: `string`, regex) (default: `\\.zip$`)<br/>\n  Specifies a regex which selects which artifact to use by filename (case-insensitively). Not having exactly one\n  matching asset is an error.\n- `use_filename_version` (type: `boolean`, default: `false`)<br/>\n  Specifies if the filename of the matched artifact should be used as the value of the `version` property. Combined\n  with the `x_netkan_version_edit` property this allows the version to be extracted from the filename itself.\n  Otherwise the expectation is that the archive will have an AVC `.version` file which will be used to generate the\n  `version` value.\n\nIf any options are not present their default values are used.\n\nAn example `.netkan` excerpt:\n\n```yaml\n$kref: '#/ckan/jenkins/https://jenkins.kspmods.example/job/AwesomeMod/'\nx_netkan_jenkins:\n  build: stable\n  asset_match: \\.zip$\n  use_filename_version: false\n```\n\n###### `#/ckan/http/:url`\n\nIndicates that data should be fetched from an HTTP server, using the `:url` provided. For example:\n\n```yaml\n$kref: '#/ckan/http/https://mysite.com/download_my_mod'\n```\n\nWhen used, the following fields will be auto-filled if not already present:\n\n- `download`\n- `download_size`\n- `download_hash`\n- `download_content_type`\n\nThis method depends on the existence of an AVC `.version` file in the download file\nto determine:\n\n- `version`\n\n###### `#/ckan/ksp-avc/:url`\n\nIndicates that data should be fetched from a KSP-AVC .version file at the `:url` provided. The file should be in the KSP-AVC JSON file format, see [the KSP-AVC spec]. The `DOWNLOAD` property of the file is used to find the download. For example: `#/ckan/ksp-avc/http://taniwha.org/~bill/EL.version`\n\n[the KSP-AVC spec]: https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/KSPAddonVersionChecker/blob/master/Documents/MiniAVC/README.md\n\nWhen used, the following fields will be auto-filled if not already present:\n\n- `name`\n- `download`\n- `download_size`\n- `download_hash`\n- `download_content_type`\n- `resources.repository`\n- `version`\n- `ksp_version`\n- `ksp_version_min`\n- `ksp_version_max`\n\n###### `#/ckan/netkan/:url`\n\nIndicates that data should be fetched from another `.netkan` file hosted remotely.\nFor example: `#/ckan/netkan/https://www.kspmods.example/AwesomeMod.netkan`.\n\nThe remote `.netkan` file is downloaded and used as if it were the original. `.netkan` files which contain such a\nreference are known as *recursive netkans* or *metanetkans*. They are primarily used so that mod authors can provide\nauthoritative metadata.\n\nA metanetkan may be in either JSON or YAML format.\n\nThe following conditions apply:\n\n- A metanekan may not reference another metanetkan, otherwise an error is produced.\n- Any fields specified in the metanetkan will override any fields in the target netkan file.\n\nWhen used, the following fields will be auto-filled if not already present:\n\n- `resources.metanetkan`\n\nAn example `.netkan` including all required fields for a valid metanetkan:\n\n```yaml\nspec_version: 1,\nidentifier: AwesomeMod\n$kref: '#/ckan/netkan/https://www.kspmods.example/AwesomeMod.netkan'\n```\n\n##### `$vref`\n\nThe `$vref` field indicates that version data should be filled in from an external service provider. Only *one*\n`$vref` field may be present in a document.\n\n###### `#/ckan/ksp-avc[[/path]/avcfilename.version]`\n\nIf present, a `$vref` symbol of `#/ckan/ksp-avc` states that version\ninformation should be retrieved from an embedded KSP-AVC `.version` file in the\nfile downloaded by the `download` field. The following conditions apply:\n\n- Only `.version` files that would be *installed* for this mod are considered. (In theory. Transformer ordering may cause files outside the installed folders being considered)\n- It is an error if more than one `.version` file would be considered.\n- It is an error if the `.version` file does not validate according to\n  [the KSP-AVC spec].\n- The `KSP_VERSION` field for the `.version` file will be ignored if the\n  `KSP_VERSION_MIN` and `KSP_VERSION_MAX` fields are set.\n- Netkan will first attempt to use anything after `ksp-avc` as a literal\n   path within the zip file, and if that fails, will use the string as a\n   regexp to search for a matching file to use.\n\nWhen used, the following fields are auto-generated:\n\n- `ksp_version`\n- `ksp_version_min`\n- `ksp_version_max`\n- `resources.remote-avc` (if the `URL` property is present in the version file)\n\nVersion information is generated in such a way as to ensure maximum compatibility. For example if the `.version` file\nspecifies that the mod is compatible with KSP version `1.0.2` but the existing `version` specifies `1.0.5` then the\nversion information generated will give a `ksp_version_min` of `1.0.2` and a `ksp_version_max` of `1.0.5`.\n\nIf (and only if) no mod version number has been identified (eg a `#/ckan/http/:url`), then the following field will also be auto-generated:\n\n- `version`\n\n###### `#/ckan/space-warp[[/path]/swinfo.json]`\n\nIf present, a `$vref` symbol of `#/ckan/space-warp` states that version\ninformation should be retrieved from an embedded SpaceWarp `swinfo.json` file in the\nfile downloaded by the `download` field.\n\nWhen used, the following fields are auto-generated:\n\n- `ksp_version`\n- `ksp_version_min`\n- `ksp_version_max`\n- `name`\n- `author`\n- `abstract`\n- `version`\n- `resources.remote-swinfo` (if the `version_check` property is present in the `swinfo.json` file)\n\n##### `x_netkan_epoch`\n\nThe `x_netkan_epoch` field is used to specify a minimum `epoch` number manually in the `version` field. Its value should be\nan unsigned 32-bit integer.\n\nNote that an epoch can be added without this property or incremented automatically, if the auto-indexer detects an out-of-order\nrelease.\n\nAn example `.netkan` excerpt:\n\n```yaml\nx_netkan_epoch: 1\n```\n\n##### `x_netkan_allow_out_of_order`\n\nIf true, then this module allows a freshly released version to have a version number smaller than previously existing releases.\n\nThis should be used for modules that intentionally release \"backport\" versions, to disable automatic incrementing of epochs for\nout of order releases.\nTypical mods should not use this property, to allow their version epochs to be automatically incremented if they release an out\nof order version.\n\nAn example `.netkan` excerpt:\n\n```yaml\nx_netkan_allow_out_of_order: true\n```\n\n##### `x_netkan_force_v`\n\nThe `x_netkan_force_v` field is used to specify that a `v` should be prepended to the `version` field. It is a\n`boolean` field.\n\nA combination of `x_netkan_epoch` and `x_netkan_version_edit` should be used instead to ensure that the `version`\nfield *only* contains the actual version string.\n\nAn example `.netkan` excerpt:\n\n```yaml\nx_netkan_force_v: true\n```\n\n##### `x_netkan_version_edit`\n\nThe `x_netkan_version_edit` field is used to edit the final value of the `version` field. `x_netkan_version_edit` is\nan `object` with the following fields:\n\n- `find` (type: `string`, regex) (default: *none*)<br/>\n   A regex to match against the existing `version` field.\n- `replace` (type: `string`, regex substitution) (default: `\"${version}\"`)<br/>\n  Specifies a [regex substitution string](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ewy2t5e0%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) which\n  will be used as the value of the new `version` field.\n  The following special variables are supported and will be filled in by various metadata aggregated during inflation:\n  - `${tag}` (`$kref #/ckan/github` only): Replaced with the release tag from GitHub.\n- `strict` (type: `boolean`, default: `true`)<br/>\n  Specifies if NetKAN should produce an error if `find` fails to produce a match against the `version` field.\n\n`x_netkan_version_edit` can also be a `string` in which case its value is treated as the value the `find` field and\nthe default values for the `replace` and `strict` fields are used.\n\nAn example `.netkan` excerpt:\n\n```yaml\n$kref: '#/ckan/jenkins/https://jenkins.kspmods.example/job/AwesomeMod/'\nx_netkan_version_edit:\n  find: ^[vV]?(?<version>.+)$\n  replace: ${version}\n  strict: true\n```\n\n##### `x_netkan_override`\n\nThe `x_netkan_override` field is used to override field values based on the value of the `version` field.\n`x_netkan_override` is an `array` of `object`s. Each `object` may have the following fields:\n\n- `version` (type: `array` of `string`, version comparison)<br/>\n  An array of version comparison strings that are used to match against `version`. Version comparison strings are of\n  the form `\"[operator]<version>\"` where `operator` is one of `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`. If no `operator` is given\n  it is equivalent to specifying `=`. In order for the override to match *all* the comparisons must be true. Therefore\n  a range may be specified as such: `[ \">=1.0\", \"<2.0\" ]`. A `string` may also be specified instead of an `array` in\n  which case it is treated as an array with a single element equal to the value of the string.\n- `before` (type: `string`, transformation name)<br/>\n  The name of a transformation this override to happen directly before.\n- `after` (type: `string`, transformation name)<br/>\n  The name of a transformation this override to happen directly after.\n- `override` (type: `object`)<br/>\n  An object whose fields will override the fields already present if a match occurs. No merging of values occurs, the\n  values of the fields are entirely replaced.\n- `delete` (type: `array` of `string`)<br/>\n  An array of strings which are the names of fields to remove if a match occurs.\n\nThe possible values of `before` and `after` are:\n\n- `$none`\n- `$all`\n- `avc`\n- `download_attributes`\n- `epoch`\n- `forced_v`\n- `generated_by`\n- `github`\n- `http`\n- `internal_ckan`\n- `jenkins`\n- `metanetkan`\n- `optimus_prime`\n- `property_sort`\n- `spacedock`\n- `curse`\n- `strip_netkan_metadata`\n- `version_edit`\n- `versioned_override`\n\nIf no `before` or `after` is specified then the override occurs at a \"reasonable\" point in the transformation process.\nMost overrides should **not** specify a `before` or `after` unless there is a specific need to.\n\nWhen any metadata changes occur which are version specific, for example a new dependency is added, overrides are the\nrecommended means of specifying them. Overrides may also be used to *stage* metadata changes, for example when new\ndependencies are anticipated to be added in yet unreleased versions of a mod. This allows mod metadata to be\nup-to-date as soon as possible without requiring excessive coordination.\n\n##### `x_netkan_staging` and `x_netkan_staging_reason`\n\nThese properties alter the way the NetKAN-bot pushes updated metadata for a module. Normally, a new or changed .ckan file\nwill be committed and pushed to CKAN-meta's `master` branch, which makes it immediately available to users. If there is a\nchance that such an update will contain incorrect metadata, for example if the game compatibility is hard-coded in the\nnetkan and changes upstream, then a manual review step may be advisable.\n\nIf `x_netkan_staging` is set to `true`, changed metadata files for this module will be committed to a separate\nmodule-specific branch and a pull request will be created to merge this branch to `master`. This allows CKAN team members\nto check manually that the changes are correct before they are released to users.\n\nTo make the review process easier, set `x_netkan_staging_reason` to a string explaining why staging is enabled. This will\nbe inserted into the body of the pull request as a reminder of the manual checks that should be performed before merging.\nFor example, you may advise reviewers to check a module's game compatibility metadata against its forum thread.\n"
