It is feasible to downgrade this project to a previous version of the Unity software but it may cause issues in doing so.\n\nThis project uses the newer Unity software XR management system and the newer Unity Input system.\n\nThis VRTK v4 Farm Yard example project has been updated to use the latest [Tilia] packages but is still in development and is missing a number of features from the previous release that used the deprecated [VRTK.Prefabs] package.\n\nThe current missing features are:\n\n* Locomotion\n  * Drag World\n* Pointers\n  * PlayArea Boundary Cursor\n\nThese features will be added in due course.\n\nIf you want to get started with the Tilia repos then check out the [Bowling Tutorial].\n\n## Introduction\n\nVRTK aims to make building spatial computing solutions in the [Unity] software fast and easy for beginners as well as experienced developers.\n\n> You do not need to download anything else to get this Unity project running, simply open the downloaded Unity project in the Unity software as outlined by the Getting Started guide below.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Downloading the project\n\n* Download this project repository to your local machine using *one* of the following methods:\n  * Git clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK.git`\n  * Download the zip file at `https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK/archive/master.zip` and extract it.\n\n### Opening the downloaded project in the Unity software\n\n> *Do not* drag and drop the VRTK project download into an existing Unity project. The VRTK repository download *is a Unity project* already and you should not nest a Unity project inside another Unity project. Follow the instructions below for opening the VRTK project within the Unity software.\n\n#### Using the Unity Hub\n\n* Open the [Unity Hub] panel.\n* Click the `Add` Button:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1029673/68544837-112cb180-03bf-11ea-8118-acd2640cfe30.png)\n\n* Browse to the local directory where the repository was downloaded to and click `Select Folder`:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1029673/68544843-1a1d8300-03bf-11ea-9b88-60f55eddf617.png)\n\n* The VRTK project will now show up in the Unity Hub project window, so select it to open the VRTK project in the Unity software:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1029673/68544856-243f8180-03bf-11ea-8890-1be86159e7f6.png)\n\n* The VRTK project will now open within the Unity software.\n\n#### Opening from within the Unity software\n\n* Select `Main Menu -> File -> Open Project` within the Unity software.\n* Browse to the local directory where the repository was downloaded to and click `Select Folder`.\n* The VRTK project will now open within the Unity software.\n\n### Running the example scene\n\n* Open the `Assets/Samples/Farm/Scenes/ExampleScene` scene.\n* Enable `Maximize On Play` in the Unity Game view control bar to ensure no performance issues are caused by the Unity Editor overhead.\n* Play the scene in the Unity Editor (`CTRL` + `P`).\n* The scene should automatically play within any Unity supported XR hardware.\n* Explore the farm yard and enjoy!\n\n## Made With
