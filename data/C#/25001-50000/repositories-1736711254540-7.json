Make sure your machine is running on Windows 10 1903 (19h1) or later.\n1. Install [**Visual Studio 2022 17.3 or later**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) installed with the following Workloads, or import the [vs2022.vsconfig](vs2022.vsconfig) file.\n    * ASP.NET and web development\n    * Node.js development\n    * .NET desktop development\n1. Install latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n### Finalize your environment\n1. Clone this repository.\n1. Open a PowerShell command prompt in the root folder of this repository.\n1. Install Nuke.Build command line tooling with the following command from the command prompt:\n    ```\n    dotnet tool install Nuke.GlobalTool --global\n    ```\n1. Restore all the dependencies with the following command:\n    ```\n    .\\init.ps1\n    ```\n\n### Build, Run & Debug\n1. Open `src/DevToys-Windows.sln` with Visual Studio.\n1. In Visual Studio, set `app/dev/platforms/desktop/DevToys.Windows` or `app/dev/platforms/desktop/DevToys.CLI` as startup project.\n1. Now you should be able to build and run DevToys on your machine by pressing `F5`.\n1. Most of the `DevToys.Windows` app runs in a web browser (WebView2). Press `F12` to open the web developer tools.\n\n## From macOS\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. Make sure your machine is running on macOS 12.0 or later.\n1. Install [**Xcode 15.0**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or later. Run it at least once and allow it to install the built-in macOS and iOS tooling.\n1. [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [**C# Dev Kit**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit), or [**JetBrains Rider**](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).\n   > [**Visual Studio for Mac**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) is not supported because it is a deprecated product and does not support .NET 8.0.\n1. **.NET SDK**. This is required to build the app itself.\n    * [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0) (**version 8.0 (SDK 8.0.100)** or later). If you're on a [Mac computer with Apple silicon processor](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814), you need to install the Arm64 version of the SDK.\n    > Use `dotnet --version` from the terminal to get the version installed.\n1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **14.0 or later**. This is required to build Monaco Editor.\n2. If you're using an [Mac computer with Apple silicon processor](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814), install [Rosetta 2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment) using the following command in a Terminal:\n    ```\n    softwareupdate --install-rosetta\n    ```\n\n### Finalize your environment\n1. Clone this repository.\n1. Open a Terminal\n1. Install Nuke.Build command line tooling with the following command from the command prompt:\n    ```\n    dotnet tool install Nuke.GlobalTool --global\n    ```\n1. Restore all the dependencies with the following command:\n    ```\n    sh init.sh\n    ```\n\n### Build, Run & Debug\n#### If you are using JetBrains Rider:\n1. Open `src/DevToys-MacOS.sln` with JetBrains Rider.\n1. Set `app/dev/platforms/desktop/DevToys.MacOS` or `app/dev/platforms/desktop/DevToys.CLI` as startup project.\n1. Now you should be able to build and run DevToys on your machine.\n\n#### If you are using Visual Studio Code:\n1. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code to edit the code.\n1. In `Run and Debug`, select `DevToys MacOS` or `DevToys CLI` and press Start.\n\n#### Special note for `DevToys.MacOS`\nMost of the `DevToys.MacOS` app runs in a web browser (Safari). In order to access the Safari developer tools with macOS to debug the HTML/CSS/JS of the Blazor app, you might need to follow the following instructions:\n1. Open desktop Safari.\n2. Select the Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Show features for web developers in the menu bar checkbox.\n3. Run the `DevToys.MacOS` app in macOS.\n4. Return to Safari. On the main menu, select Develop > {REMOTE INSPECTION TARGET} > 0.0.0.0, where the {REMOTE INSPECTION TARGET} placeholder is either the devices's plain name (for example, MacBook Pro) or the device's serial number (for example XMVM7VFF10). If multiple entries for 0.0.0.0 are present, select the entry that highlights the BlazorWebView. The BlazorWebView is highlighted in blue in macOS when the correct 0.0.0.0 entry is selected.\n5. The Web Inspector window appears for the BlazorWebView.\n\n## From Linux\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. Make sure your machine has GTK4 and WebKitGTK installed. Distro like Ubuntu generally have it pre-installed.\n1. [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [**C# Dev Kit**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit), or [**JetBrains Rider**](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).\n1. **.NET SDK**. This is required to build the app itself.\n    * [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0) (**version 8.0 (SDK 8.0.100)** or later).\n    * Unless GTK has been installed through `snap`, we recommend to avoid installing .NET from `snap`.\n    * We recommend installing .NET from the [official script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-scripted-manual#scripted-install), then [the dependencies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu#dependencies), and finally set the [environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-scripted-manual#set-environment-variables-system-wide).\n    * > Use `dotnet --version` from the terminal to get the version installed.\n1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **14.0 or later**. This is required to build Monaco Editor.\n\n### Finalize your environment\n1. Clone this repository.\n1. Open a Terminal command prompt in the root folder of this repository.\n1. Install Nuke.Build command line tooling with the following command from the command prompt:\n    ```\n    dotnet tool install Nuke.GlobalTool --global\n    ```\n1. Restore all the dependencies with the following command:\n    ```\n    bash init.sh\n    ```\n\n### Build, Run & Debug\n#### If you are using JetBrains Rider:\n1. Open `src/DevToys-Linux.sln` with JetBrains Rider.\n1. Set `app/dev/platforms/desktop/DevToys.Linux` or `app/dev/platforms/desktop/DevToys.CLI` as startup project.\n1. Now you should be able to build and run DevToys on your machine.\n\n#### If you are using Visual Studio Code:\n1. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code to edit the code.\n1. In `Run and Debug`, select `DevToys Linux` or `DevToys CLI` and press Start.\n\n# How to Build and Run DevToys and DevToys CLI with default tools from source:\n\nSee [DevToys.Tools's CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/DevToys-app/DevToys.Tools/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n# Internationalization and localization\n\nPlease use Crowdin to translate DevToys and its tools. Crowdin is a localization management platform that helps individuals to translate a project without having to be familiar with its repository.\n\n* Go on [DevToy's Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/devtoys).\n* Log in or create an account. Join the DevToys project.\n* Select the language of your choice in the list of existing supported language and let yourself guided by the website to translate the app.\n* If you want to add a new language, please create a new discussion on Crowdin's website or on GitHub. We will be happy to add your language to the list.\n* When your translation is done, it will be synchronized with our GitHub repository within 1 hour and create a pull request.\n"
