It might helps others that have similar question.\n\n## üôå Share Chatflow\n\nYes! Sharing how you use Flowise is a way of contribution. Export your chatflow as JSON, attach a screenshot and share it in [Show and Tell section](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).\n\n## üí° Ideas\n\nIdeas are welcome such as new feature, apps integration, and blockchain networks. Submit in [Ideas section](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/discussions/categories/ideas).\n\n## üêû Report Bugs\n\nFound an issue? [Report it](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/issues/new/choose).\n\n## üë®‚Äçüíª Contribute to Code\n\nNot sure what to contribute? Some ideas:\n\n-   Create new components from `packages/components`\n-   Update existing components such as extending functionality, fixing bugs\n-   Add new chatflow ideas\n\n### Developers\n\nFlowise has 3 different modules in a single mono repository.\n\n-   `server`: Node backend to serve API logics\n-   `ui`: React frontend\n-   `components`: Third-party nodes integrations\n\n#### Prerequisite\n\n-   Install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation). The project is configured to use pnpm v9.\n    ```bash\n    npm i -g pnpm\n    ```\n\n#### Step by step\n\n1. Fork the official [Flowise Github Repository](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise).\n\n2. Clone your forked repository.\n\n3. Create a new branch, see [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository). Naming conventions:\n\n    - For feature branch: `feature/<Your New Feature>`\n    - For bug fix branch: `bugfix/<Your New Bugfix>`.\n\n4. Switch to the newly created branch.\n\n5. Go into repository folder\n\n    ```bash\n    cd Flowise\n    ```\n\n6. Install all dependencies of all modules:\n\n    ```bash\n    pnpm install\n    ```\n\n7. Build all the code:\n\n    ```bash\n    pnpm build\n    ```\n\n8. Start the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\n\n    ```bash\n    pnpm start\n    ```\n\n9. For development:\n\n    - Create `.env` file and specify the `VITE_PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/ui`\n    - Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/server`\n    - Run\n\n    ```bash\n    pnpm dev\n    ```\n\n    Any changes made in `packages/ui` or `packages/server` will be reflected on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\n\n    For changes made in `packages/components`, run `pnpm build` again to pickup the changes.\n\n10. After making all the changes, run\n\n    ```bash\n    pnpm build\n    ```\n\n    and\n\n    ```bash\n    pnpm start\n    ```\n\n    to make sure everything works fine in production.\n\n11. Commit code and submit Pull Request from forked branch pointing to [Flowise master](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/tree/master).\n\n## üå± Env Variables\n\nFlowise support different environment variables to configure your instance. You can specify the following variables in the `.env` file inside `packages/server` folder.

Install Flowise\n    ```bash\n    npm install -g flowise\n    ```\n2. Start Flowise\n\n    ```bash\n    npx flowise start\n    ```\n\n    With username & password\n\n    ```bash\n    npx flowise start --FLOWISE_USERNAME=user --FLOWISE_PASSWORD=1234\n    ```\n\n3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\n\n## üê≥ Docker\n\n### Docker Compose\n\n1. Clone the Flowise project\n2. Go to `docker` folder at the root of the project\n3. Copy `.env.example` file, paste it into the same location, and rename to `.env` file\n4. `docker compose up -d`\n5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\n6. You can bring the containers down by `docker compose stop`\n\n### Docker Image\n\n1. Build the image locally:\n    ```bash\n    docker build --no-cache -t flowise .\n    ```\n2. Run image:\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run -d --name flowise -p 3000:3000 flowise\n    ```\n\n3. Stop image:\n    ```bash\n    docker stop flowise\n    ```\n\n## üë®‚Äçüíª Developers\n\nFlowise has 3 different modules in a single mono repository.\n\n-   `server`: Node backend to serve API logics\n-   `ui`: React frontend\n-   `components`: Third-party nodes integrations\n-   `api-documentation`: Auto-generated swagger-ui API docs from express\n\n### Prerequisite\n\n-   Install [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)\n    ```bash\n    npm i -g pnpm\n    ```\n\n### Setup\n\n1.  Clone the repository\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise.git\n    ```\n\n2.  Go into repository folder\n\n    ```bash\n    cd Flowise\n    ```\n\n3.  Install all dependencies of all modules:\n\n    ```bash\n    pnpm install\n    ```\n\n4.  Build all the code:\n\n    ```bash\n    pnpm build\n    ```\n\n    <details>\n    <summary>Exit code 134 (JavaScript heap out of memory)</summary>  \n      If you get this error when running the above `build` script, try increasing the Node.js heap size and run the script again:\n\n        export NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max-old-space-size=4096\"\n        pnpm build\n\n    </details>\n\n5.  Start the app:\n\n    ```bash\n    pnpm start\n    ```\n\n    You can now access the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\n\n6.  For development build:\n\n    -   Create `.env` file and specify the `VITE_PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/ui`\n    -   Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/server`\n    -   Run\n\n        ```bash\n        pnpm dev\n        ```\n\n    Any code changes will reload the app automatically on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\n\n## üîí Authentication\n\nTo enable app level authentication, add `FLOWISE_USERNAME` and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` to the `.env` file in `packages/server`:\n\n```\nFLOWISE_USERNAME=user\nFLOWISE_PASSWORD=1234\n```\n\n## üå± Env Variables\n\nFlowise support different environment variables to configure your instance. You can specify the following variables in the `.env` file inside `packages/server` folder.
