The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected.

If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a\ncontract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your\nacceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\nsuch rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from\nmaking the Licensed Material available under these terms and\nconditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  g.

Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  k.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

There are really\nsuper roadmaps and coursework for those career paths elsewhere (see https://roadmap.sh/ for more info).\n\nThere is a lot to learn in a university Computer Science program, but only knowing about 75% is good enough for an interview, so that's what I cover here.\nFor a complete CS self-taught program, the resources for my study plan have been included in Kamran Ahmed's Computer Science Roadmap: https://roadmap.sh/computer-science\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n### The Study Plan\n\n- [What is it?](#what-is-it)\n- [Why use it?](#why-use-it)\n- [How to use it](#how-to-use-it)\n- [Don't feel you aren't smart enough](#dont-feel-you-arent-smart-enough)\n- [A Note About Video Resources](#a-note-about-video-resources)\n- [Choose a Programming Language](#choose-a-programming-language)\n- [Books for Data Structures and Algorithms](#books-for-data-structures-and-algorithms)\n- [Interview Prep Books](#interview-prep-books)\n- [Don't Make My Mistakes](#dont-make-my-mistakes)\n- [What you Won't See Covered](#what-you-wont-see-covered)\n- [The Daily Plan](#the-daily-plan)\n- [Coding Question Practice](#coding-question-practice)\n- [Coding Problems](#coding-problems)\n\n### Topics of Study\n\n- [Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis](#algorithmic-complexity--big-o--asymptotic-analysis)\n- [Data Structures](#data-structures)\n    -

If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it would have been terrible.\nEvery data structure I had ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked\nunder the hood at all. I never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an \"out of\nmemory\" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and\nthousands of associative arrays, but I never created data structures from scratch.\n\nIt's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## How to use it\n\nEverything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.\n\nI'm using GitHub's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to track progress.\n  - [More about GitHub-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)\n\n### If you don't want to use git\n\nOn this page, click the Code button near the top, then click \"Download ZIP\". Unzip the file and you can work with the text files.\n\nIf you're open in a code editor that understands markdown, you'll see everything formatted nicely.\n\n![How to download the repo as a zip file](https://d3j2pkmjtin6ou.cloudfront.net/how-to-download-as-zip.png)\n\n### If you're comfortable with git\n\nCreate a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]\n\n1. ***Fork the GitHub repo:*** `https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university` by clicking on the Fork button.\n\n    ![Fork the GitHub repo](https://d3j2pkmjtin6ou.cloudfront.net/fork-button.png)\n\n1. Clone to your local repo:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/coding-interview-university.git\n    cd coding-interview-university\n    git remote add upstream https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university.git\n    git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE  # so that you don't push your personal progress back to the original repo\n    ```\n\n1.

These are called MOOCs.\nSometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access.\n\nIt would be great to replace the online course resources with free and always-available public sources,\nsuch as YouTube videos (preferably university lectures), so that you people can study these anytime,\nnot just when a specific online course is in session.\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Choose a Programming Language\n\nYou'll need to choose a programming language for the coding interviews you do,\nbut you'll also need to find a language that you can use to study computer science concepts.\n\nPreferably the language would be the same, so that you only need to be proficient in one.\n\n### For this Study Plan\n\nWhen I did the study plan, I used 2 languages for most of it: C and Python\n\n* C: Very low level. Allows you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures\n    and algorithms in your bones. In higher-level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day-to-day work, that's terrific,\n    but when you're learning how these low-level data structures are built, it's great to feel close to the metal.\n    - C is everywhere. You'll see examples in books, lectures, videos, *everywhere* while you're studying.\n    - [The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)\n        - This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little\n            you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.\n        - You don't need to go super deep in the book (or even finish it). Just get to where you're comfortable reading and writing in C.\n* Python: Modern and very expressive, I learned it because it's just super useful and also allows me to write less code in an interview.\n\nThis is my preference. You do what you like, of course.\n\nYou may not need it, but here are some sites for learning a new language:\n- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks)\n- [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com)\n- [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/for-developers/)\n- [Scaler Topics (Java, C++)](https://www.scaler.com/topics/)\n- [Programiz PRO Community Challenges)](https://programiz.pro/)\n\n### For your Coding Interview\n\nYou can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:\n\n- C++\n- Java\n- Python\n\nYou could also use these, but read around first. There may be caveats:\n\n- JavaScript\n- Ruby\n\nHere is an article I wrote about choosing a language for the interview:\n[Pick One Language for the Coding Interview](https://startupnextdoor.com/important-pick-one-language-for-the-coding-interview/).\nThis is the original article my post was based on: [Choosing a Programming Language for Interviews](https://web.archive.org/web/20210516054124/http://blog.codingforinterviews.com/best-programming-language-jobs/)\n\nYou need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable.\n\nRead more about choices:\n- [Choose the Right Language for Your Coding Interview](http://www.byte-by-byte.com/choose-the-right-language-for-your-coding-interview/)\n\n[See language-specific resources here](programming-language-resources.md)\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Books for Data Structures and Algorithms\n\nThis book will form your foundation for computer science.\n\nJust choose one, in a language that you will be comfortable with.

And you'll save months of time.\n\n### 1. You Won't Remember it All\n\nI watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was much I didn't remember. I spent 3 days going\nthrough my notes and making flashcards, so I could review. I didn't need all of that knowledge.\n\nPlease, read so you won't make my mistakes:\n\n[Retaining Computer Science Knowledge](https://startupnextdoor.com/retaining-computer-science-knowledge/).\n\n### 2. Use Flashcards\n\nTo solve the problem, I made a little flashcard site where I could add flashcards of 2 types: general and code.\nEach card has a different formatting. I made a mobile-first website, so I could review on my phone or tablet, wherever I am.\n\nMake your own for free:\n\n- [Flashcards site repo](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards)\n\n**I DON'T RECOMMEND using my flashcards.** There are too many and most of them are trivia that you don't need.\n\nBut if you don't want to listen to me, here you go:\n- [My flash cards database (1200 cards)](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham.db):\n- [My flash cards database (extreme - 1800 cards)](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham-extreme.db):\n\nKeep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics.\nIt's way too much for what's required.\n\n**Note on flashcards:** The first time you recognize you know the answer, don't mark it as known. You have to see the\nsame card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in\nyour brain.\n\nAn alternative to using my flashcard site is [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), which has been recommended to me numerous times.\nIt uses a repetition system to help you remember. It's user-friendly, available on all platforms, and has a cloud sync system.\nIt costs $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms.\n\nMy flashcard database in Anki format: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560 (thanks [@xiewenya](https://github.com/xiewenya)).\n\nSome students have mentioned formatting issues with white space that can be fixed by doing the following: open the deck, edit the card, click cards, select the \"styling\" radio button, and add the member \"white-space: pre;\" to the card class.\n\n### 3. Do Coding Interview Questions While You're Learning\n\nTHIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.\n\nStart doing coding interview questions while you're learning data structures and algorithms.\n\nYou need to apply what you're learning to solve problems, or you'll forget. I made this mistake.\n\nOnce you've learned a topic, and feel somewhat comfortable with it, for example, **linked lists**:\n1. Open one of the [coding interview books](#interview-prep-books) (or coding problem websites, listed below)\n1. Do 2 or 3 questions regarding linked lists.\n1. Move on to the next learning topic.\n1. Later, go back and do another 2 or 3 linked list problems.\n1. Do this with each new topic you learn.\n\n**Keep doing problems while you're learning all this stuff, not after.**\n\nYou're not being hired for knowledge, but how you apply the knowledge.\n\nThere are many resources for this, listed below. Keep going.\n\n### 4. Focus\n\nThere are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard. Turn on some music\nwithout lyrics and you'll be able to focus pretty well.\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## What you won't see covered\n\nThese are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan:\n\n- Javascript\n- HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies\n- SQL\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## The Daily Plan\n\nThis course goes over a lot of subjects. Each will probably take you a few days, or maybe even a week or more. It depends on your schedule.\n\nEach day, take the next subject in the list, watch some videos about that subject, and then write an implementation\nof that data structure or algorithm in the language you chose for this course.\n\nYou can see my code here:\n - [C](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-c)\n - [C++](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-cpp)\n - [Python](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-python)\n\nYou don't need to memorize every algorithm. You just need to be able to understand it enough to be able to write your own implementation.\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Coding Question Practice\n\n    Why is this here? I'm not ready to interview.\n\n[Then go back and read this.](#3-do-coding-interview-questions-while-youre-learning)\n\nWhy you need to practice doing programming problems:\n- Problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in\n- Gathering requirements for the problem\n- Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview\n- Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer\n- Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions (see Big-O below)\n- Testing your solutions\n\nThere is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem-solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming\ninterview books, too, but I found this outstanding:\n[Algorithm design canvas](http://www.hiredintech.com/algorithm-design/)\n\nWrite code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then type it and test it out on a computer.\n\nIf you don't have a whiteboard at home, pick up a large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice.\nThis is my \"sofa whiteboard\". I added the pen in the photo just for scale. If you use a pen, you'll wish you could erase.\nGets messy quickly. **I use a pencil and eraser.**\n\n![my sofa whiteboard](https://d3j2pkmjtin6ou.cloudfront.net/art_board_sm_2.jpg)\n\n**Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Coding Problems\n\nDon't forget your key coding interview books [here](#interview-prep-books).\n\nSolving Problems:\n- [How to Find a Solution](https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/How%20To%20Find%20a%20Solution)\n- [How to Dissect a Topcoder Problem Statement](https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/How%20To%20Dissect%20a%20Topcoder%20Problem%20Statement%20Content)\n\nCoding Interview Question Videos:\n- [IDeserve (88 videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLamzFoFxwoNjPfxzaWqs7cZGsPYy0x_gI)\n- [Tushar Roy (5 playlists)](https://www.youtube.com/user/tusharroy2525/playlists?shelf_id=2&view=50&sort=dd)\n    - Super for walkthroughs of problem solutions\n- [Nick White - LeetCode Solutions (187 Videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU_sdQYzUj2keVENTP0a5rdykRSgg9Wp-)\n    - Good explanations of the solution and the code\n    - You can watch several in a short time\n- [FisherCoder - LeetCode Solutions](https://youtube.com/FisherCoder)\n\nChallenge/Practice sites:\n- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)\n    - My favorite coding problem site.

The insertion and deletion\n            operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an\n            important tool for understanding the logic behind red-black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce\n            2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though **2-4 trees are not often used in practice**.\n        - [CS 61B Lecture 26: Balanced Search Trees (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_zqrqYXkth6Q)\n        - [Bottom Up 234-Trees (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQdMYevEyE4&index=4&list=PLA5Lqm4uh9Bbq-E0ZnqTIa8LRaL77ica6)\n        - [Top Down 234-Trees (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2679VQ26Fp4&list=PLA5Lqm4uh9Bbq-E0ZnqTIa8LRaL77ica6&index=5)\n\n    - **N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees**\n        - note: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)\n        - binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2\n        - 2-3 trees are 3-ary\n        - [K-Ary Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-ary_tree)\n\n    - **B-Trees**\n        - Fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor).\n        - In Practice:\n            B-trees are widely used in databases.
