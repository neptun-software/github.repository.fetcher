After all, it's a curation, not a collection.\n\nBut **what is awesome?**\n\n## Only awesome is awesome\n\nResearch if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.\n\n## Awesome badge\n\nThis badge is for Awesome lists.\n\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n\nAdd an awesome badge to the top of your list, right next to the title. [Example](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs). You can choose either the regular badge or the flat one.\n\n```md\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n```\n\nYou are allowed to use the badge on lists not included here and also on private lists.\n\n*The badges should not be modified in any way.*\n\n## Awesome mentioned badge\n\nThis badge is for projects being mentioned in an Awesome list (**NOT for use in Awesome lists**). For example, the [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) project could feature this badge because it's listed in [Awesome Node.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs). It's totally optional for projects, but it's a nice way to show they've been featured in an Awesome list. You can choose either the regular badge or the flat one.\n\n[![Mentioned in Awesome](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n[![Mentioned in Awesome](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n\n**Fill in the placeholders (Name and URL):**\n\n```md\n[![Mentioned in Awesome <INSERT LIST NAME>](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/<INSERT LIST URL>)\n[![Mentioned in Awesome <INSERT LIST NAME>](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/<INSERT LIST URL>)\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```md\n[![Mentioned in Awesome Node.js](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs)\n```\n\nIf you're an Awesome list maintainer, you could encourage projects in your list to add the badge.\n\n*The badges should not be modified in any way.*\n\n## Comment on why something is awesome\n\nApart from suggesting a particular item on your list, you should also inform your readers *why* it's on the list and how they will benefit from it.\n\n## Make it clear what the list is about\n\nHave a succinct description at the top of your readme. Make sure your list covers a certain scope and nothing else. Link to other awesome lists if you think they already cover a certain subject well enough.\n\n## Pay attention to grammar\n\nEnsure your list is grammatically correct, typo-free and has no Markdown formatting errors. This should also apply to pull requests.\n\n## Choose an appropriate license\n\nKeep in mind that if you [haven't selected a license](https://choosealicense.com/no-license/), it basically means the people are *not* allowed to reproduce, distribute or create derivative works.\n\n[Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/) are perfect for this purpose. **We would recommend [`CC0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).** Code licenses like MIT, BSD, GPL, and so forth are not recommended.\n\n## Include contribution guidelines\n\nPeople who are contributing to your list should have a clear understanding of how they should do so.\n\nIf you don't feel like writing one from scratch, feel free to take our [contributing.md](contributing.md) and modify it to your own needs.\n\n## Stylize your list properly\n\nCreate a [table of contents](https://github.com/sindresorhus/stuff/blob/main/toc-generators.md), organize the content into different categories, and use images if suitable. Ensure all entries are consistent (e.g. all entry descriptions end in a `.`).\n\n## Accept other people's opinion\n\nIf you're an owner of the list, respect other people's opinions. If there are plenty of users not agreeing with your decision, give it a second thought.\n"

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\nCopyright and Related Rights.

Neither are WTFPL and [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org).\n\t- Place a file named `license` or `LICENSE` in the repo root with the license text.\n\t- **Do not** add the license name, text, or a `Licence` section to the readme.

The Awesome badge is enough.\n\n**Go to the top and read it again.**\n"
