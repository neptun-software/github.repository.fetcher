Run `pnpm install` in the root of the repository to install all dependencies.\n1. Run `pnpm link --dir ./pnpm/dev -g` to make pnpm from the repository available in the command line via the `pd` command.\n1. Run `pnpm run compile` to create an initial build of pnpm from the source in the repository.\n1. Now you can change any source code file and run `pd [command] [flags]` to run `pnpm` directly from the source code by compiling all the files without typechecking in memory.\n1. Alternatively, for recompiling all the projects with typechecking after your changes, again run `pnpm run compile` in the root of the repository. To run a task that will recompile the projects on change, run `pnpm run watch`.\n1. Install [`git-lfs` following the directions from its docs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs#installing). This is required to run certain tests that require large files.\n   - Run `git lfs pull` after installing for good measure. This is required if Git LFS was installed after cloning the pnpm git repo.\n1. In order to run all the tests in the repository, run `pnpm run test-main`. You may also run tests of specific projects by running `pnpm test` inside a project's directory or using `pnpm --filter <project name> test`.\n\nSome of the e2e tests run node-gyp, so you might need to install some build-essentials on your system for those tests to pass. On Fedora, install these:\n\n```\nsudo dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\nYou can run the tests of the project that you modified by going to the project's directory and running:\n\n```shell\npnpm test\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can run it from anywhere by specifying the name of the project using the `--filter` option:\n\n```shell\npnpm --filter core test\n```\n\nIf you want to pass options to Jest, use the `pnpm run test` command and append any needed options. For instance, if you want to run a single test in a single file, run:\n\n```shell\npnpm --filter core run test test/lockfile.ts -t \"lockfile has dev deps even when installing for prod only\"\n```\n\n## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\n\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\n- Search [GitHub](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pulls) for an open or closed PR\n  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n- Make your changes in a new git branch:\n\n  ```shell\n  git checkout -b my-fix-branch main\n  ```\n\n- Create your patch, following [code style guidelines](#coding-style-guidelines), and **including appropriate test cases**.\n- Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository and describe your changes. The resulting files should be committed as they will be used during release.\n- Run the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.\n- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\n  [commit message conventions](#commit-message-guidelines). Adherence to these conventions\n  is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n\n  ```shell\n  git commit -a\n  ```\n\n  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\n- Push your branch to GitHub:\n\n  ```shell\n  git push origin my-fix-branch\n  ```\n\n- In GitHub, send a pull request to `pnpm:main`.\n- If we suggest changes then:\n\n  - Make the required updates.\n  - Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\n  - Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\n\n    ```shell\n    git rebase main -i\n    git push -f\n    ```\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\n\n### After your pull request is merged\n\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\n- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:\n\n  ```shell\n  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch\n  ```\n\n- Check out the main branch:\n\n  ```shell\n  git checkout main -f\n  ```\n\n- Delete the local branch:\n\n  ```shell\n  git branch -D my-fix-branch\n  ```\n\n- Update your main with the latest upstream version:\n\n  ```shell\n  git pull --ff upstream main\n  ```\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\n[![js-standard-style](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)\n\nUse the [Standard Style](https://github.com/standard/standard).\n\n## Commit Message Guidelines\n\n[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)\n\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more\nreadable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.\n\n### Commit Message Format\n\nEach commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special\nformat that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:\n\n    <type>(<scope>): <subject>\n    <BLANK LINE>\n    <body>\n    <BLANK LINE>\n    <footer>\n\nThe **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.\n\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\n\n#### Revert\n\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.\n\n#### Type\n\nMust be one of the following:\n\n- **feat**: A new feature\n- **fix**: A bug fix\n- **docs**: Documentation only changes\n- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\n  semi-colons, etc)\n- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n- **perf**: A code change that improves performance\n- **test**: Adding missing tests\n- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation\n  generation\n\n#### Scope\n\nThe scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example\n`plugin-example`, `render-md`, etc.\n\n#### Subject\n\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\n- use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\n- don't capitalize first letter\n- no dot (.) at the end\n\n#### Body\n\nJust as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\n\n#### Footer\n\nThe footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to\nreference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.\n\n**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.\n"

the alternatives (see [benchmark](#benchmark)).\n* **Efficient.** Files inside `node_modules` are linked from a single content-addressable storage.\n* **[Great for monorepos](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).**\n* **Strict.** A package can access only dependencies that are specified in its `package.json`.\n* **Deterministic.** Has a lockfile called `pnpm-lock.yaml`.\n* **Works as a Node.js version manager.** See [pnpm env use](https://pnpm.io/cli/env).\n* **Works everywhere.** Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n* **Battle-tested.** Used in production by teams of [all sizes](https://pnpm.io/users) since 2016.\n* [See the full feature comparison with npm and Yarn](https://pnpm.io/feature-comparison).\n\nTo quote the [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) team:\n\n> Microsoft uses pnpm in Rush repos with hundreds of projects and hundreds of PRs per day, and we’ve found it to be very fast and reliable.\n\n[![npm

100 projects using lodash, you will have 100 copies of lodash on disk.\nWith pnpm, lodash will be stored in a content-addressable storage, so:\n\n1. If you depend on different versions of lodash, only the files that differ are added to the store.\n  If lodash has 100 files, and a new version has a change only in one of those files,\n  `pnpm update` will only add 1 new file to the storage.\n1. All the files are saved in a single place on the disk. When packages are installed, their files are linked\n  from that single place consuming no additional disk space. Linking is performed using either hard-links or reflinks (copy-on-write).\n\nAs a result, you save gigabytes of space on your disk and you have a lot faster installations!\nIf you'd like more details about the unique `node_modules` structure that pnpm creates and\nwhy it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read this small article: [Flat node_modules is not the only way](https://pnpm.io/blog/2020/05/27/flat-node-modules-is-not-the-only-way).\n\n💖 Like this project?
