(#4479)\n\n### Parser\n\n<!-- Changes to the parser or to version autodetection -->\n\n### Performance\n\n<!-- Changes that improve Black's performance. -->\n- Speed up the `is_fstring_start` function in Black's tokenizer (#4541)\n\n### Output\n\n<!-- Changes to Black's terminal output and error messages -->\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n<!-- Changes to blackd -->\n\n### Integrations\n\n<!-- For example, Docker, GitHub Actions, pre-commit, editors -->\n\n- If using stdin with `--stdin-filename` set to a force excluded path, stdin won't be\n  formatted. (#4539)\n\n### Documentation\n\n<!-- Major changes to documentation and policies. Small docs changes\n     don't need a changelog entry. -->\n\n## 24.10.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Black is now officially tested with Python 3.13 and provides Python 3.13\n  mypyc-compiled wheels. (#4436) (#4449)\n- Black will issue an error when used with Python 3.12.5, due to an upstream memory\n  safety issue in Python 3.12.5 that can cause Black's AST safety checks to fail. Please\n  use Python 3.12.6 or Python 3.12.4 instead. (#4447)\n- Black no longer supports running with Python 3.8 (#4452)\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix crashes involving comments in parenthesised return types or `X | Y` style unions.\n  (#4453)\n- Fix skipping Jupyter cells with unknown `%%` magic (#4462)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Fix type annotation spacing between * and more complex type variable tuple (i.e. `def\n  fn(*args: *tuple[*Ts, T]) -> None: pass`) (#4440)\n\n### Caching\n\n- Fix bug where the cache was shared between runs with and without `--unstable` (#4466)\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Upgrade version of mypyc used to 1.12 beta (#4450) (#4449)\n- `blackd` now requires a newer version of aiohttp. (#4451)\n\n### Output\n\n- Added Python target version information on parse error (#4378)\n- Add information about Black version to internal error messages (#4457)\n\n## 24.8.0\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix crash when `# fmt: off` is used before a closing parenthesis or bracket. (#4363)\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Packaging metadata updated: docs are explictly linked, the issue tracker is now also\n  linked. This improves the PyPI listing for Black. (#4345)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Fix regression where Black failed to parse a multiline f-string containing another\n  multiline string (#4339)\n- Fix regression where Black failed to parse an escaped single quote inside an f-string\n  (#4401)\n- Fix bug with Black incorrectly parsing empty lines with a backslash (#4343)\n- Fix bugs with Black's tokenizer not handling `\\{` inside f-strings very well (#4422)\n- Fix incorrect line numbers in the tokenizer for certain tokens within f-strings\n  (#4423)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Improve performance when a large directory is listed in `.gitignore` (#4415)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- Fix blackd (and all extras installs) for docker container (#4357)\n\n## 24.4.2\n\nThis is a bugfix release to fix two regressions in the new f-string parser introduced in\n24.4.1.\n\n### Parser\n\n- Fix regression where certain complex f-strings failed to parse (#4332)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Fix bad performance on certain complex string literals (#4331)\n\n## 24.4.1\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Add support for the new Python 3.12 f-string syntax introduced by PEP 701 (#3822)\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix crash involving indented dummy functions containing newlines (#4318)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Add support for type parameter defaults, a new syntactic feature added to Python 3.13\n  by PEP 696 (#4327)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Github Action now works even when `git archive` is skipped (#4313)\n\n## 24.4.0\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix unwanted crashes caused by AST equivalency check (#4290)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- `if` guards in `case` blocks are now wrapped in parentheses when the line is too long.\n  (#4269)\n- Stop moving multiline strings to a new line unless inside brackets (#4289)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Add a new option `use_pyproject` to the GitHub Action `psf/black`. This will read the\n  Black version from `pyproject.toml`. (#4294)\n\n## 24.3.0\n\n### Highlights\n\nThis release is a milestone: it fixes Black's first CVE security vulnerability. If you\nrun Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands of leading tab\ncharacters in your docstrings, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately to fix\n[CVE-2024-21503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503).\n\nThis release also fixes a bug in Black's AST safety check that allowed Black to make\nincorrect changes to certain f-strings that are valid in Python 3.12 and higher.\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Don't move comments along with delimiters, which could cause crashes (#4248)\n- Strengthen AST safety check to catch more unsafe changes to strings. Previous versions\n  of Black would incorrectly format the contents of certain unusual f-strings containing\n  nested strings with the same quote type. Now, Black will crash on such strings until\n  support for the new f-string syntax is implemented. (#4270)\n- Fix a bug where line-ranges exceeding the last code line would not work as expected\n  (#4273)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Fix catastrophic performance on docstrings that contain large numbers of leading tab\n  characters. This fixes\n  [CVE-2024-21503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503).\n  (#4278)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Note what happens when `--check` is used with `--quiet` (#4236)\n\n## 24.2.0\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fixed a bug where comments where mistakenly removed along with redundant parentheses\n  (#4218)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Move the `hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets` feature to the unstable style\n  due to an outstanding crash and proposed formatting tweaks (#4198)\n- Fixed a bug where base expressions caused inconsistent formatting of \\*\\* in tenary\n  expression (#4154)\n- Checking for newline before adding one on docstring that is almost at the line limit\n  (#4185)\n- Remove redundant parentheses in `case` statement `if` guards (#4214).\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Fix issue where _Black_ would ignore input files in the presence of symlinks (#4222)\n- _Black_ now ignores `pyproject.toml` that is missing a `tool.black` section when\n  discovering project root and configuration. Since _Black_ continues to use version\n  control as an indicator of project root, this is expected to primarily change behavior\n  for users in a monorepo setup (desirably). If you wish to preserve previous behavior,\n  simply add an empty `[tool.black]` to the previously discovered `pyproject.toml`\n  (#4204)\n\n### Output\n\n- Black will swallow any `SyntaxWarning`s or `DeprecationWarning`s produced by the `ast`\n  module when performing equivalence checks (#4189)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Add a JSONSchema and provide a validate-pyproject entry-point (#4181)\n\n## 24.1.1\n\nBugfix release to fix a bug that made Black unusable on certain file systems with strict\nlimits on path length.\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Consistently add trailing comma on typed parameters (#4164)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Shorten the length of the name of the cache file to fix crashes on file systems that\n  do not support long paths (#4176)\n\n## 24.1.0\n\n### Highlights\n\nThis release introduces the new 2024 stable style (#4106), stabilizing the following\nchanges:\n\n- Add parentheses around `if`-`else` expressions (#2278)\n- Dummy class and function implementations consisting only of `...` are formatted more\n  compactly (#3796)\n- If an assignment statement is too long, we now prefer splitting on the right-hand side\n  (#3368)\n- Hex codes in Unicode escape sequences are now standardized to lowercase (#2916)\n- Allow empty first lines at the beginning of most blocks (#3967, #4061)\n- Add parentheses around long type annotations (#3899)\n- Enforce newline after module docstrings (#3932, #4028)\n- Fix incorrect magic trailing comma handling in return types (#3916)\n- Remove blank lines before class docstrings (#3692)\n- Wrap multiple context managers in parentheses if combined in a single `with` statement\n  (#3489)\n- Fix bug in line length calculations for power operations (#3942)\n- Add trailing commas to collection literals even if there's a comment after the last\n  entry (#3393)\n- When using `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` or `-C`, trailing commas are stripped from\n  subscript expressions with more than 1 element (#3209)\n- Add extra blank lines in stubs in a few cases (#3564, #3862)\n- Accept raw strings as docstrings (#3947)\n- Split long lines in case blocks (#4024)\n- Stop removing spaces from walrus operators within subscripts (#3823)\n- Fix incorrect formatting of certain async statements (#3609)\n- Allow combining `# fmt: skip` with other comments (#3959)\n\nThere are already a few improvements in the `--preview` style, which are slated for the\n2025 stable style. Try them out and\n[share your feedback](https://github.com/psf/black/issues). In the past, the preview\nstyle has included some features that we were not able to stabilize. This year, we're\nadding a separate `--unstable` style for features with known problems. Now, the\n`--preview` style only includes features that we actually expect to make it into next\nyear's stable style.\n\n### Stable style\n\nSeveral bug fixes were made in features that are moved to the stable style in this\nrelease:\n\n- Fix comment handling when parenthesising conditional expressions (#4134)\n- Fix bug where spaces were not added around parenthesized walruses in subscripts,\n  unlike other binary operators (#4109)\n- Remove empty lines before docstrings in async functions (#4132)\n- Address a missing case in the change to allow empty lines at the beginning of all\n  blocks, except immediately before a docstring (#4130)\n- For stubs, fix logic to enforce empty line after nested classes with bodies (#4141)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Add `--unstable` style, covering preview features that have known problems that would\n  block them from going into the stable style. Also add the `--enable-unstable-feature`\n  flag; for example, use\n  `--enable-unstable-feature hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets` to apply this\n  preview feature throughout 2024, even if a later Black release downgrades the feature\n  to unstable (#4096)\n- Format module docstrings the same as class and function docstrings (#4095)\n- Fix crash when using a walrus in a dictionary (#4155)\n- Fix unnecessary parentheses when wrapping long dicts (#4135)\n- Stop normalizing spaces before `# fmt: skip` comments (#4146)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Print warning when configuration in `pyproject.toml` contains an invalid key (#4165)\n- Fix symlink handling, properly ignoring symlinks that point outside of root (#4161)\n- Fix cache mtime logic that resulted in false positive cache hits (#4128)\n- Remove the long-deprecated `--experimental-string-processing` flag. This feature can\n  currently be enabled with `--preview --enable-unstable-feature string_processing`.\n  (#4096)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Revert the change to run Black's pre-commit integration only on specific git hooks\n  (#3940) for better compatibility with older versions of pre-commit (#4137)\n\n## 23.12.1\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Fixed a bug that included dependencies from the `d` extra by default (#4108)\n\n## 23.12.0\n\n### Highlights\n\nIt's almost 2024, which means it's time for a new edition of _Black_'s stable style!\nTogether with this release, we'll put out an alpha release 24.1a1 showcasing the draft\n2024 stable style, which we'll finalize in the January release. Please try it out and\n[share your feedback](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4042).\n\nThis release (23.12.0) will still produce the 2023 style. Most but not all of the\nchanges in `--preview` mode will be in the 2024 stable style.\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix bug where `# fmt: off` automatically dedents when used with the `--line-ranges`\n  option, even when it is not within the specified line range. (#4084)\n- Fix feature detection for parenthesized context managers (#4104)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Prefer more equal signs before a break when splitting chained assignments (#4010)\n- Standalone form feed characters at the module level are no longer removed (#4021)\n- Additional cases of immediately nested tuples, lists, and dictionaries are now\n  indented less (#4012)\n- Allow empty lines at the beginning of all blocks, except immediately before a\n  docstring (#4060)\n- Fix crash in preview mode when using a short `--line-length` (#4086)\n- Keep suites consisting of only an ellipsis on their own lines if they are not\n  functions or class definitions (#4066) (#4103)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- `--line-ranges` now skips _Black_'s internal stability check in `--safe` mode. This\n  avoids a crash on rare inputs that have many unformatted same-content lines. (#4034)\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Upgrade to mypy 1.7.1 (#4049) (#4069)\n- Faster compiled wheels are now available for CPython 3.12 (#4070)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Enable 3.12 CI (#4035)\n- Build docker images in parallel (#4054)\n- Build docker images with 3.12 (#4055)\n\n## 23.11.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Support formatting ranges of lines with the new `--line-ranges` command-line option\n  (#4020)\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix crash on formatting bytes strings that look like docstrings (#4003)\n- Fix crash when whitespace followed a backslash before newline in a docstring (#4008)\n- Fix standalone comments inside complex blocks crashing Black (#4016)\n- Fix crash on formatting code like `await (a ** b)` (#3994)\n- No longer treat leading f-strings as docstrings. This matches Python's behaviour and\n  fixes a crash (#4019)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Multiline dicts and lists that are the sole argument to a function are now indented\n  less (#3964)\n- Multiline unpacked dicts and lists as the sole argument to a function are now also\n  indented less (#3992)\n- In f-string debug expressions, quote types that are visible in the final string are\n  now preserved (#4005)\n- Fix a bug where long `case` blocks were not split into multiple lines. Also enable\n  general trailing comma rules on `case` blocks (#4024)\n- Keep requiring two empty lines between module-level docstring and first function or\n  class definition (#4028)\n- Add support for single-line format skip with other comments on the same line (#3959)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Consistently apply force exclusion logic before resolving symlinks (#4015)\n- Fix a bug in the matching of absolute path names in `--include` (#3976)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Fix mypyc builds on arm64 on macOS (#4017)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Black's pre-commit integration will now run only on git hooks appropriate for a code\n  formatter (#3940)\n\n## 23.10.1\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Maintenance release to get a fix out for GitHub Action edge case (#3957)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Fix merging implicit multiline strings that have inline comments (#3956)\n- Allow empty first line after block open before a comment or compound statement (#3967)\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Change Dockerfile to hatch + compile black (#3965)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- The summary output for GitHub workflows is now suppressible using the `summary`\n  parameter. (#3958)\n- Fix the action failing when Black check doesn't pass (#3957)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- It is known Windows documentation CI is broken\n  https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3968\n\n## 23.10.0\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix comments getting removed from inside parenthesized strings (#3909)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Fix long lines with power operators getting split before the line length (#3942)\n- Long type hints are now wrapped in parentheses and properly indented when split across\n  multiple lines (#3899)\n- Magic trailing commas are now respected in return types. (#3916)\n- Require one empty line after module-level docstrings. (#3932)\n- Treat raw triple-quoted strings as docstrings (#3947)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Fix cache versioning logic when `BLACK_CACHE_DIR` is set (#3937)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Fix bug where attributes named `type` were not accepted inside `match` statements\n  (#3950)\n- Add support for PEP 695 type aliases containing lambdas and other unusual expressions\n  (#3949)\n\n### Output\n\n- Black no longer attempts to provide special errors for attempting to format Python 2\n  code (#3933)\n- Black will more consistently print stacktraces on internal errors in verbose mode\n  (#3938)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- The action output displayed in the job summary is now wrapped in Markdown (#3914)\n\n## 23.9.1\n\nDue to various issues, the previous release (23.9.0) did not include compiled mypyc\nwheels, which make Black significantly faster. These issues have now been fixed, and\nthis release should come with compiled wheels once again.\n\nThere will be no wheels for Python 3.12 due to a bug in mypyc. We will provide 3.12\nwheels in a future release as soon as the mypyc bug is fixed.\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Upgrade to mypy 1.5.1 (#3864)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Store raw tuples instead of NamedTuples in Black's cache, improving performance and\n  decreasing the size of the cache (#3877)\n\n## 23.9.0\n\n### Preview style\n\n- More concise formatting for dummy implementations (#3796)\n- In stub files, add a blank line between a statement with a body (e.g an\n  `if sys.version_info > (3, x):`) and a function definition on the same level (#3862)\n- Fix a bug whereby spaces were removed from walrus operators within subscript(#3823)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Black now applies exclusion and ignore logic before resolving symlinks (#3846)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Avoid importing `IPython` if notebook cells do not contain magics (#3782)\n- Improve caching by comparing file hashes as fallback for mtime and size (#3821)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- Fix an issue in `blackd` with single character input (#3558)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Black now has an\n  [official pre-commit mirror](https://github.com/psf/black-pre-commit-mirror). Swapping\n  `https://github.com/psf/black` to `https://github.com/psf/black-pre-commit-mirror` in\n  your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will make Black about 2x faster (#3828)\n- The `.black.env` folder specified by `ENV_PATH` will now be removed on the completion\n  of the GitHub Action (#3759)\n\n## 23.7.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Runtime support for Python 3.7 has been removed. Formatting 3.7 code will still be\n  supported until further notice (#3765)\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix a bug where an illegal trailing comma was added to return type annotations using\n  PEP 604 unions (#3735)\n- Fix several bugs and crashes where comments in stub files were removed or mishandled\n  under some circumstances (#3745)\n- Fix a crash with multi-line magic comments like `type: ignore` within parentheses\n  (#3740)\n- Fix error in AST validation when _Black_ removes trailing whitespace in a type comment\n  (#3773)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Implicitly concatenated strings used as function args are no longer wrapped inside\n  parentheses (#3640)\n- Remove blank lines between a class definition and its docstring (#3692)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- The `--workers` argument to _Black_ can now be specified via the `BLACK_NUM_WORKERS`\n  environment variable (#3743)\n- `.pytest_cache`, `.ruff_cache` and `.vscode` are now excluded by default (#3691)\n- Fix _Black_ not honouring `pyproject.toml` settings when running `--stdin-filename`\n  and the `pyproject.toml` found isn't in the current working directory (#3719)\n- _Black_ will now error if `exclude` and `extend-exclude` have invalid data types in\n  `pyproject.toml`, instead of silently doing the wrong thing (#3764)\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Upgrade mypyc from 0.991 to 1.3 (#3697)\n- Remove patching of Click that mitigated errors on Python 3.6 with `LANG=C` (#3768)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Add support for the new PEP 695 syntax in Python 3.12 (#3703)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Speed up _Black_ significantly when the cache is full (#3751)\n- Avoid importing `IPython` in a case where we wouldn't need it (#3748)\n\n### Output\n\n- Use aware UTC datetimes internally, avoids deprecation warning on Python 3.12 (#3728)\n- Change verbose logging to exactly mirror _Black_'s logic for source discovery (#3749)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- The `blackd` argument parser now shows the default values for options in their help\n  text (#3712)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Black is now tested with\n  [`PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING = 1`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io-encoding-warning)\n  (#3763)\n- Update GitHub Action to display black output in the job summary (#3688)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Add a CITATION.cff file to the root of the repository, containing metadata on how to\n  cite this software (#3723)\n- Update the _classes_ and _exceptions_ documentation in Developer reference to match\n  the latest code base (#3755)\n\n## 23.3.0\n\n### Highlights\n\nThis release fixes a longstanding confusing behavior in Black's GitHub action, where the\nversion of the action did not determine the version of Black being run (issue #3382). In\naddition, there is a small bug fix around imports and a number of improvements to the\npreview style.\n\nPlease try out the\n[preview style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html#preview-style)\nwith `black --preview` and tell us your feedback. All changes in the preview style are\nexpected to become part of Black's stable style in January 2024.\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Import lines with `# fmt: skip` and `# fmt: off` no longer have an extra blank line\n  added when they are right after another import line (#3610)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Add trailing commas to collection literals even if there's a comment after the last\n  entry (#3393)\n- `async def`, `async for`, and `async with` statements are now formatted consistently\n  compared to their non-async version. (#3609)\n- `with` statements that contain two context managers will be consistently wrapped in\n  parentheses (#3589)\n- Let string splitters respect [East Asian Width](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/)\n  (#3445)\n- Now long string literals can be split after East Asian commas and periods (`、` U+3001\n  IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA, `。` U+3002 IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP, & `，` U+FF0C FULLWIDTH COMMA)\n  besides before spaces (#3445)\n- For stubs, enforce one blank line after a nested class with a body other than just\n  `...` (#3564)\n- Improve handling of multiline strings by changing line split behavior (#1879)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Added support for formatting files with invalid type comments (#3594)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Update GitHub Action to use the version of Black equivalent to action's version if\n  version input is not specified (#3543)\n- Fix missing Python binary path in autoload script for vim (#3508)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Document that only the most recent release is supported for security issues;\n  vulnerabilities should be reported through Tidelift (#3612)\n\n## 23.1.0\n\n### Highlights\n\nThis is the first release of 2023, and following our\n[stability policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy),\nit comes with a number of improvements to our stable style, including improvements to\nempty line handling, removal of redundant parentheses in several contexts, and output\nthat highlights implicitly concatenated strings better.\n\nThere are also many changes to the preview style; try out `black --preview` and give us\nfeedback to help us set the stable style for next year.\n\nIn addition to style changes, Black now automatically infers the supported Python\nversions from your `pyproject.toml` file, removing the need to set Black's target\nversions separately.\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Introduce the 2023 stable style, which incorporates most aspects of last year's\n  preview style (#3418). Specific changes:\n  - Enforce empty lines before classes and functions with sticky leading comments\n    (#3302) (22.12.0)\n  - Reformat empty and whitespace-only files as either an empty file (if no newline is\n    present) or as a single newline character (if a newline is present) (#3348)\n    (22.12.0)\n  - Implicitly concatenated strings used as function args are now wrapped inside\n    parentheses (#3307) (22.12.0)\n  - Correctly handle trailing commas that are inside a line's leading non-nested parens\n    (#3370) (22.12.0)\n  - `--skip-string-normalization` / `-S` now prevents docstring prefixes from being\n    normalized as expected (#3168) (since 22.8.0)\n  - When using `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` or `-C`, trailing commas are stripped from\n    subscript expressions with more than 1 element (#3209) (22.8.0)\n  - Implicitly concatenated strings inside a list, set, or tuple are now wrapped inside\n    parentheses (#3162) (22.8.0)\n  - Fix a string merging/split issue when a comment is present in the middle of\n    implicitly concatenated strings on its own line (#3227) (22.8.0)\n  - Docstring quotes are no longer moved if it would violate the line length limit\n    (#3044, #3430) (22.6.0)\n  - Parentheses around return annotations are now managed (#2990) (22.6.0)\n  - Remove unnecessary parentheses around awaited objects (#2991) (22.6.0)\n  - Remove unnecessary parentheses in `with` statements (#2926) (22.6.0)\n  - Remove trailing newlines after code block open (#3035) (22.6.0)\n  - Code cell separators `#%%` are now standardised to `# %%` (#2919) (22.3.0)\n  - Remove unnecessary parentheses from `except` statements (#2939) (22.3.0)\n  - Remove unnecessary parentheses from tuple unpacking in `for` loops (#2945) (22.3.0)\n  - Avoid magic-trailing-comma in single-element subscripts (#2942) (22.3.0)\n- Fix a crash when a colon line is marked between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` (#3439)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Format hex codes in unicode escape sequences in string literals (#2916)\n- Add parentheses around `if`-`else` expressions (#2278)\n- Improve performance on large expressions that contain many strings (#3467)\n- Fix a crash in preview style with assert + parenthesized string (#3415)\n- Fix crashes in preview style with walrus operators used in function return annotations\n  and except clauses (#3423)\n- Fix a crash in preview advanced string processing where mixed implicitly concatenated\n  regular and f-strings start with an empty span (#3463)\n- Fix a crash in preview advanced string processing where a standalone comment is placed\n  before a dict's value (#3469)\n- Fix an issue where extra empty lines are added when a decorator has `# fmt: skip`\n  applied or there is a standalone comment between decorators (#3470)\n- Do not put the closing quotes in a docstring on a separate line, even if the line is\n  too long (#3430)\n- Long values in dict literals are now wrapped in parentheses; correspondingly\n  unnecessary parentheses around short values in dict literals are now removed; long\n  string lambda values are now wrapped in parentheses (#3440)\n- Fix two crashes in preview style involving edge cases with docstrings (#3451)\n- Exclude string type annotations from improved string processing; fix crash when the\n  return type annotation is stringified and spans across multiple lines (#3462)\n- Wrap multiple context managers in parentheses when targeting Python 3.9+ (#3489)\n- Fix several crashes in preview style with walrus operators used in `with` statements\n  or tuples (#3473)\n- Fix an invalid quote escaping bug in f-string expressions where it produced invalid\n  code.

Native x86-64 executables for macOS are available once again.\n  (#3275)\n- Hatchling is now used as the build backend. This will not have any effect for users\n  who install Black with its wheels from PyPI. (#3233)\n- Faster compiled wheels are now available for CPython 3.11 (#3276)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- Windows style (CRLF) newlines will be preserved (#3257).\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Vim plugin: add flag (`g:black_preview`) to enable/disable the preview style (#3246)\n- Update GitHub Action to support formatting of Jupyter Notebook files via a `jupyter`\n  option (#3282)\n- Update GitHub Action to support use of version specifiers (e.g. `<23`) for Black\n  version (#3265)\n\n## 22.8.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Python 3.11 is now supported, except for _blackd_ as aiohttp does not support 3.11 as\n  of publishing (#3234)\n- This is the last release that supports running _Black_ on Python 3.6 (formatting 3.6\n  code will continue to be supported until further notice)\n- Reword the stability policy to say that we may, in rare cases, make changes that\n  affect code that was not previously formatted by _Black_ (#3155)\n\n### Stable style\n\n- Fix an infinite loop when using `# fmt: on/off` in the middle of an expression or code\n  block (#3158)\n- Fix incorrect handling of `# fmt: skip` on colon (`:`) lines (#3148)\n- Comments are no longer deleted when a line had spaces removed around power operators\n  (#2874)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Single-character closing docstring quotes are no longer moved to their own line as\n  this is invalid. This was a bug introduced in version 22.6.0. (#3166)\n- `--skip-string-normalization` / `-S` now prevents docstring prefixes from being\n  normalized as expected (#3168)\n- When using `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` or `-C`, trailing commas are stripped from\n  subscript expressions with more than 1 element (#3209)\n- Implicitly concatenated strings inside a list, set, or tuple are now wrapped inside\n  parentheses (#3162)\n- Fix a string merging/split issue when a comment is present in the middle of implicitly\n  concatenated strings on its own line (#3227)\n\n### _Blackd_\n\n- `blackd` now supports enabling the preview style via the `X-Preview` header (#3217)\n\n### Configuration\n\n- Black now uses the presence of debug f-strings to detect target version (#3215)\n- Fix misdetection of project root and verbose logging of sources in cases involving\n  `--stdin-filename` (#3216)\n- Immediate `.gitignore` files in source directories given on the command line are now\n  also respected, previously only `.gitignore` files in the project root and\n  automatically discovered directories were respected (#3237)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Recommend using BlackConnect in IntelliJ IDEs (#3150)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Vim plugin: prefix messages with `Black: ` so it's clear they come from Black (#3194)\n- Docker: changed to a /opt/venv installation + added to PATH to be available to\n  non-root users (#3202)\n\n### Output\n\n- Change from deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` to create our event loop which\n  removes DeprecationWarning (#3164)\n- Remove logging from internal `blib2to3` library since it regularly emits error logs\n  about failed caching that can and should be ignored (#3193)\n\n### Parser\n\n- Type comments are now included in the AST equivalence check consistently so accidental\n  deletion raises an error. Though type comments can't be tracked when running on PyPy\n  3.7 due to standard library limitations. (#2874)\n\n### Performance\n\n- Reduce Black's startup time when formatting a single file by 15-30% (#3211)\n\n## 22.6.0\n\n### Style\n\n- Fix unstable formatting involving `#fmt: skip` and `# fmt:skip` comments (notice the\n  lack of spaces) (#2970)\n\n### Preview style\n\n- Docstring quotes are no longer moved if it would violate the line length limit (#3044)\n- Parentheses around return annotations are now managed (#2990)\n- Remove unnecessary parentheses around awaited objects (#2991)\n- Remove unnecessary parentheses in `with` statements (#2926)\n- Remove trailing newlines after code block open (#3035)\n\n### Integrations\n\n- Add `scripts/migrate-black.py` script to ease introduction of Black to a Git project\n  (#3038)\n\n### Output\n\n- Output Python version and implementation as part of `--version` flag (#2997)\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Use `tomli` instead of `tomllib` on Python 3.11 builds where `tomllib` is not\n  available (#2987)\n\n### Parser\n\n- [PEP 654](https://peps.python.org/pep-0654/#except) syntax (for example,\n  `except *ExceptionGroup:`) is now supported (#3016)\n- [PEP 646](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646) syntax (for example,\n  `Array[Batch, *Shape]` or `def fn(*args: *T) -> None`) is now supported (#3071)\n\n### Vim Plugin\n\n- Fix `strtobool` function.

`# fmt: off` (#371)\n\n## 18.6b3\n\n- typing stub files (`.pyi`) now have blank lines added after constants (#340)\n\n- `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` are now much more dependable:\n\n  - they now work also within bracket pairs (#329)\n\n  - they now correctly work across function/class boundaries (#335)\n\n  - they now work when an indentation block starts with empty lines or misaligned\n    comments (#334)\n\n- made Click not fail on invalid environments; note that Click is right but the\n  likelihood we'll need to access non-ASCII file paths when dealing with Python source\n  code is

recent change to PEP 8](https://github.com/python/peps/commit/c59c4376ad233a62ca4b3a6060c81368bd21e85b)\n  (#21)\n\n- ignore empty bracket pairs while splitting. This avoids very weirdly looking\n  formattings (#34, #35)\n\n- remove a trailing comma if there is a single argument to a call\n\n- if top level functions were separated by a comment, don't put four empty lines after\n  the upper function\n\n- fixed unstable formatting of newlines with imports\n\n- fixed unintentional folding of post scriptum standalone comments into last statement\n  if it was a simple statement (#18, #28)\n\n- fixed missing space in numpy-style array indexing (#33)\n\n- fixed spurious space after star-based unary expressions (#31)\n\n## 18.3a1\n\n- added `--check`\n\n- only put trailing commas in function signatures and calls if it's safe to do so.

By using it, you agree to cede\ncontrol over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,\ndeterminism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time\nand mental energy for more important matters.\n\nBlackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting\nbecomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\n\n_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n\nTry it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app). Watch the\n[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.\n\n---\n\n**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)**\n\n---\n\n## Installation and usage\n\n### Installation\n\n_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.9+ to run.\nIf you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install \"black[jupyter]\"`.\n\nIf you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/psf/black`\n\n### Usage\n\nTo get started right away with sensible defaults:\n\n```sh\nblack {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nYou can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:\n\n```sh\npython -m black {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nFurther information can be found in our docs:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many\nprojects, small and big. _Black_ has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel\ntests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. Now that\nwe have become stable, you should not expect large formatting changes in the future.\nStylistic changes will mostly be responses to bug reports and support for new Python\nsyntax. For more information please refer to\n[The Black Code Style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html).\n\nAlso, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the\nreformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the\noriginal (see the\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)\nsection for details). If you're feeling confident, use `--fast`.\n\n## The _Black_ code style\n\n_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in\nplace. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn't\ntake previous formatting into account (see\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\nfor exceptions).\n\nOur documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are\nalso documented. They're both worth taking a look at:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)\n\nChanges to the _Black_ code style are bound by the Stability Policy:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Stability Policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be\nintended behaviour.\n\n### Pragmatism\n\nEarly versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its\ninitial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and\nthere were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,\n_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.\n\n- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document\nabove. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.\n\n## Configuration\n\n_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options\nfrom a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom\n`--include` and `--exclude`/`--force-exclude`/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your\nproject.\n\nYou can find more details in our documentation:\n\n- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)\n\nAnd if you're looking for more general configuration documentation:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n**Pro-tip**: If you're asking yourself \"Do I need to configure anything?\" the answer is\n\"No\". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your\ncode in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.\n\n## Used by\n\nThe following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent\ncode style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs,\nSQLAlchemy, Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv),\npandas, Pillow, Twisted, LocalStack, every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant,\nZulip, Kedro, OpenOA, FLORIS, ORBIT, WOMBAT, and many more.\n\nThe following organizations use _Black_: Dropbox, KeepTruckin, Lyft, Mozilla,\nQuora, Duolingo, QuantumBlack, Tesla, Archer Aviation.\n\nAre we missing anyone? Let us know.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n**Mike Bayer**, [author of `SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/):\n\n> I can't think of any single tool in my entire programming career that has given me a\n> bigger productivity increase by its introduction. I can now do refactorings in about\n> 1% of the keystrokes that it would have taken me previously when we had no way for\n> code to format itself.\n\n**Dusty Phillips**,\n[writer](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dusty+phillips):\n\n> _Black_ is opinionated so you don't have to be.\n\n**Hynek Schlawack**, [creator of `attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/), core developer of\nTwisted and CPython:\n\n> An auto-formatter that doesn't suck is all I want for Xmas!\n\n**Carl Meyer**, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) core developer:\n\n> At least the name is good.\n\n**Kenneth Reitz**, creator of [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\nand [`pipenv`](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pipenv/):\n\n> This vastly improves the formatting of our code.

You can get started by\nreading this:\n\n- [Contributing: The basics](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/the_basics.html)\n\nYou can also take a look at the rest of the contributing docs or talk with the\ndevelopers:\n\n- [Contributing documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html)\n- [Chat on Discord](https://discord.gg/RtVdv86PrH)\n\n## Change log\n\nThe log has become rather long. It moved to its own file.\n\nSee [CHANGES](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/change_log.html).\n\n## Authors\n\nThe author list is quite long nowadays, so it lives in its own file.\n\nSee [AUTHORS.md](./AUTHORS.md)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone participating in the _Black_ project, and in particular in the issue tracker,\npull requests, and social media activity, is expected to treat other people with respect\nand more generally to follow the guidelines articulated in the\n[Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).\n\nAt the same time, humor is encouraged. In fact, basic familiarity with Monty Python's\nFlying Circus is expected. We are not savages.\n\nAnd if you _really_ need to slap somebody, do it with a fish while dancing.\n"
