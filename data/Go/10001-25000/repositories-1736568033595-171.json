Start by taking a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/issues) for things we need help with!\n\nPlease follow standard github best practices: fork the repo, branch from the tip of develop, make some commits, and submit a pull request to develop. \n\nPlease make sure to use `gofmt` before every commit - the easiest way to do this is have your editor run it for you upon saving a file. Otherwise, run the following command in the project root directory: `go fmt ./...`\n\n## Forking\n\nPlease note that Go requires code to live under absolute paths, which complicates forking.\nWhile the fork for user 'foo' lives at `https://github.com/foo/amass`,\nthe code should never exist at  `$GOPATH/src/github.com/foo/amass`.\nInstead, we use `git remote` to add the fork as a new remote for the original repo,\n`$GOPATH/src/github.com/owasp-amass/amass`, and do all the work there.\n\nFor instance, to create a fork and work on a branch of it, user 'foo' would:\n\n  * Create the fork on github, using the fork button.\n  * Go to the original repo checked out locally (ie. `$GOPATH/src/github.com/owasp-amass/amass`)\n  * `git remote rename origin upstream`\n  * `git remote add origin git@github.com:foo/amass.git`\n\nNow `origin` refers to the foo fork and `upstream` refers to the OWASP version.\nSo foo can `git push -u origin master` to update his/her fork, and make pull requests to OWASP from there.\nOf course, replace `foo` with your git handle.\n\nTo pull in updates from the original repo, run\n\n    * `git fetch upstream`\n    * `git rebase upstream/master` (or whatever branch you want)\n\nPlease don't make Pull Requests to `master`.\n\n### Development Procedure:\n- the latest state of development is on `develop`\n- no --force onto `develop` (except when reverting a broken commit, which should seldom happen)\n- create a development branch on your fork (using `git add origin`)\n- before submitting a pull request, begin `git rebase` on top of `develop`\n"

Pull the Docker image by running `docker pull caffix/amass`\n3. Run `docker run -v OUTPUT_DIR_PATH:/.config/amass/ caffix/amass enum -d example.com`\n\nThe volume argument allows the Amass graph database to persist between executions and output files to be accessed on the host system. The first field (left of the colon) of the volume option is the amass output directory that is external to Docker, while the second field is the path, internal to Docker, where amass will write the output files.\n\n### From Source\n\n1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and setup your Go workspace\n2. Download OWASP Amass by running `go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master`\n3. At this point, the binary should be in `$GOPATH/bin`\n\n## Documentation [![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4?utm_source=godoc)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4)\n\nUse the [Installation Guide](./doc/install.md) to get started.\n\nGo to the [User's Guide](./doc/user_guide.md) for additional information.\n\nSee the [Tutorial](./doc/tutorial.md) for example usage.\n\nSee the [Amass Scripting Engine Manual](./doc/scripting.md) for greater control over your enumeration process.\n\n## Corporate Supporters\n\n[![ZeroFox Logo](./images/zerofox_logo.png)](https://www.zerofox.com/) [![IPinfo Logo](./images/ipinfo_logo.png)](https://ipinfo.io/) [![WhoisXML API Logo](./images/whoisxmlapi_logo.png)](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/)\n\n## Testimonials\n\n### [![Accenture Logo](./images/accenture_logo.png) Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/)\n\n*\"Accenture’s adversary simulation team has used Amass as our primary tool suite on a variety of external enumeration projects and attack surface assessments for clients. It’s been an absolutely invaluable basis for infrastructure enumeration, and we’re really grateful for all the hard work that’s gone into making and maintaining it – it’s made our job much easier!\"*\n\n\\- Max Deighton, Accenture Cyber Defense Manager\n\n### [![Visma Logo](./images/visma_logo.png) Visma](https://www.visma.com/)\n\n*\"For an internal red team, the organisational structure of Visma puts us against a unique challenge. Having sufficient, continuous visibility over our external attack surface is an integral part of being able to efficiently carry out our task. When dealing with hundreds of companies with different products and supporting infrastructure we need to always be on top of our game.*\n\n*For years, OWASP Amass has been a staple in the asset reconnaissance field, and keeps proving its worth time after time. The tool keeps constantly evolving and improving to adapt to the new trends in this area.\"*\n\n\\- Joona Hoikkala ([@joohoi](https://github.com/joohoi)) & Alexis Fernández ([@six2dez](https://github.com/six2dez)), Visma Red Team\n\n## References [![DEF CON 30 Recon Village](https://img.shields.io/badge/defcon%2030-recon%20village-lightgrey.svg)](https://twitter.com/jeff_foley/status/1562246069278445568/photo/1) [![DEF CON 28 Red Team Village](https://img.shields.io/badge/defcon%2028-red%20team%20village-red.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/c/RedTeamVillage/featured) [![DEF CON 27 Demo Labs](https://img.shields.io/badge/defcon%2027-demo%20labs-purple.svg)](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-27/dc-27-demolabs.html) \n\nDid you write a blog post, magazine article or do a podcast about OWASP Amass?
