The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Read the page before\ngetting started!\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any issues whilst using cert-manager, we have a number of ways to get help:\n\n- A [troubleshooting guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/faq/troubleshooting/) on our website.\n- Our official [Kubernetes Slack channel](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/#slack) - the quickest way to ask! ([#cert-manager](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/cert-manager) and [#cert-manager-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/cert-manager-dev))\n- [Searching for an existing issue](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues).\n\nIf you believe you've found a bug and cannot find an existing issue, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues)!\nBe sure to include as much information as you can about your environment.\n\n## Community\n\nThe `cert-manager-dev` Google Group is used for project wide announcements and development coordination.\nAnybody can join the group by visiting [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cert-manager-dev)\nand clicking \"Join Group\". A Google account is required to join the group.\n\n### Meetings\n\nWe have several public meetings which any member of our Google Group is more than welcome to join!\n\nCheck out the details on [our website](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/#meetings). Feel\nfree to drop in and ask questions, chat with us or just to say hi!\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome pull requests with open arms! There's a lot of work to do here, and\nwe're especially concerned with ensuring the longevity and reliability of the\nproject. The [contributing guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/)\nwill help you get started.\n\n## Coding Conventions\n\nCode style guidelines are documented on the [coding conventions](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/coding-conventions/) page\nof the cert-manager website. Please try to follow those guidelines if you're submitting a pull request for cert-manager.\n\n## Importing cert-manager as a Module\n\n⚠️ Please note that cert-manager **does not** currently provide a Go module compatibility guarantee. That means that\n**most code under `pkg/` is subject to change in a breaking way**, even between minor or patch releases and even if\nthe code is currently publicly exported.\n\nThe lack of a Go module compatibility guarantee does not affect API version guarantees\nunder the [Kubernetes Deprecation Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/).\n\nFor more details see [Importing cert-manager in Go](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/importing/) on the\ncert-manager website.\n\nThe import path for cert-manager versions 1.8 and later is `github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager`.\n\nFor all versions of cert-manager before 1.8, including minor and patch releases, the import path is `github.com/jetstack/cert-manager`.\n\n## Security Reporting\n\nSecurity is the number one priority for cert-manager. If you think you've found a security vulnerability, we'd love to hear from you.\n\nFollow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) to make a report.\n\n## Changelog\n\n[Every release](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases) on GitHub has a changelog,\nand we also publish release notes on [the website](https://cert-manager.io/docs/release-notes/).\n\n## History\n\ncert-manager is loosely based upon the work of [kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego)\nand has borrowed some wisdom from other similar projects such as [kube-cert-manager](https://github.com/PalmStoneGames/kube-cert-manager).\n\n\n<sub><sup>Logo design by [Zoe Paterson](https://zoepatersonmedia.com)</sup></sub>\n"

For documentation on how those artifacts are produced see the \"Process\" section.\n\n- *Container Images* - Container images for the cert-manager project are published for all cert-manager components. \n- *Helm chart* - An official Helm chart is maintained within this repo and published to `charts.jetstack.io` on each cert-manager release.\n- *Binaries* - Until version 1.15 the cmctl binary was maintained within this repo and published as part of the cert-manager release. For releases after 1.15 the CLI has moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/cert-manager/cmctl). Binary builds are still available for download from this new location."
