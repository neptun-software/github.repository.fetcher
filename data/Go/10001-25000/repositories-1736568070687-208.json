[webhooks](https://docs.livekit.io/home/server/webhooks/). In addition, the Go SDK includes client capabilities,\nenabling you to build automations that behave like end-users.\n\n| Language                | Repo                                                                                    | Docs                                                        |\n| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Go                      | [server-sdk-go](https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-go)                               | [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/livekit/server-sdk-go) |\n| JavaScript (TypeScript) | [server-sdk-js](https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-js)                               | [docs](https://docs.livekit.io/server-sdk-js/)              |\n| Ruby                    | [server-sdk-ruby](https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-ruby)                           |                                                             |\n| Java (Kotlin)           | [server-sdk-kotlin](https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-kotlin)                       |                                                             |\n| Python (community)      | [python-sdks](https://github.com/livekit/python-sdks)                                   |                                                             |\n| PHP (community)         | [agence104/livekit-server-sdk-php](https://github.com/agence104/livekit-server-sdk-php) |                                                             |\n\n### Tools\n\n-   [CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) - command line interface & load tester\n-   [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/livekit/livekit-server)\n-   [Helm charts](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-helm)\n\n## Install\n\n> [!TIP]\n> We recommend installing [LiveKit CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) along with the server. It lets you access\n> server APIs, create tokens, and generate test traffic.\n\nThe following will install LiveKit's media server:\n\n### MacOS\n\n```shell\nbrew install livekit\n```\n\n### Linux\n\n```shell\ncurl -sSL https://get.livekit.io | bash\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nDownload the [latest release here](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases/latest)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Starting LiveKit\n\nStart LiveKit in development mode by running `livekit-server --dev`. It'll use a placeholder API key/secret pair.\n\n```\nAPI Key: devkey\nAPI Secret: secret\n```\n\nTo customize your setup for production, refer to our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/)\n\n### Creating access token\n\nA user connecting to a LiveKit room requires an [access token](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/#creating-a-token). Access\ntokens (JWT) encode the user's identity and the room permissions they've been granted. You can generate a token with our\nCLI:\n\n```shell\nlk token create \\\n    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \\\n    --join --room my-first-room --identity user1 \\\n    --valid-for 24h\n```\n\n### Test with example app\n\nHead over to our [example app](https://example.livekit.io) and enter a generated token to connect to your LiveKit\nserver. This app is built with our [React SDK](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-react).\n\nOnce connected, your video and audio are now being published to your new LiveKit instance!\n\n### Simulating a test publisher\n\n```shell\nlk room join \\\n    --url ws://localhost:7880 \\\n    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \\\n    --identity bot-user1 \\\n    --publish-demo \\\n    my-first-room\n```\n\nThis command publishes a looped demo video to a room. Due to how the video clip was encoded (keyframes every 3s),\nthere's a slight delay before the browser has sufficient data to begin rendering frames. This is an artifact of the\nsimulation.\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Use LiveKit Cloud\n\nLiveKit Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to run LiveKit. Every project gets free monthly bandwidth and\ntranscoding credits.\n\nSign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).\n\n### Self-host\n\nRead our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/) for more information.\n\n## Building from source\n\nPre-requisites:\n\n-   Go 1.23+ is installed\n-   GOPATH/bin is in your PATH\n\nThen run\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/livekit/livekit\ncd livekit\n./bootstrap.sh\nmage\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions toward improving LiveKit! Please join us\n[on Slack](http://livekit.io/join-slack) to discuss your ideas and/or PRs.\n\n## License\n\nLiveKit server is licensed under Apache License v2.0.\n\n<!--BEGIN_REPO_NAV-->\n\n<br/><table>\n\n<thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">LiveKit Ecosystem</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Realtime SDKs</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/components-js\">React Components</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-js\">Browser</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/components-swift\">Swift Components</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-swift\">iOS/macOS/visionOS</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-android\">Android</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-flutter\">Flutter</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-react-native\">React Native</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/rust-sdks\">Rust</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/node-sdks\">Node.js</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/python-sdks\">Python</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity-web\">Unity (web)</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity\">Unity (beta)</a></td></tr><tr></tr>\n<tr><td>Server APIs</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/node-sdks\">Node.js</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-go\">Golang</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-ruby\">Ruby</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-kotlin\">Java/Kotlin</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/python-sdks\">Python</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/rust-sdks\">Rust</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/agence104/livekit-server-sdk-php\">PHP (community)</a></td></tr><tr></tr>\n<tr><td>Agents Frameworks</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/agents\">Python</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/agent-playground\">Playground</a></td></tr><tr></tr>\n<tr><td>Services</td><td><b>LiveKit server</b> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/egress\">Egress</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/ingress\">Ingress</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/sip\">SIP</a></td></tr><tr></tr>\n<tr><td>Resources</td><td><a href=\"https://docs.livekit.io\">Docs</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit-examples\">Example apps</a> · <a href=\"https://livekit.io/cloud\">Cloud</a> · <a href=\"https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/deployment\">Self-hosting</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli\">CLI</a></td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!--END_REPO_NAV-->\n"
