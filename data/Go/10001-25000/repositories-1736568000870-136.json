For more details see [the design documentation][design doc].\n\n**NOTE**: kind is still a work in progress, see the [1.0 roadmap].\n\n## Installation and usage\n\nFor a complete [install guide] see [the documentation here][install guide].\n\nYou can install kind with `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.26.0`.\n\n**NOTE**: please use the latest go to do this. KIND is developed with the latest stable go, see [`.go-version`](./.go-version) for the exact version we're using.\n\nThis will put `kind` in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. If you encounter the error\n`kind: command not found` after installation then you may need to either add that directory to your `$PATH` as\nshown [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) or do a manual installation by cloning the repo and run\n`make build` from the repository.\n\nWithout installing go, kind can be built reproducibly with docker using `make build`.\n\nStable binaries are also available on the [releases] page. Stable releases are\ngenerally recommended for CI usage in particular.\nTo install, download the binary for your platform from \"Assets\" and place this\ninto your `$PATH`:\n\nOn Linux:\n\n```console\n# For AMD64 / x86_64\n[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.26.0/kind-$(uname)-amd64\n# For ARM64\n[ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.26.0/kind-$(uname)-arm64\nchmod +x ./kind\nsudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind\n```\n\nOn macOS via Homebrew:\n\n```console\nbrew install kind\n```\n\nOn macOS via MacPorts:\n\n```console\nsudo port selfupdate && sudo port install kind\n```\n\nOn macOS via Bash:\n\n```console\n# For Intel Macs\n[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.26.0/kind-darwin-amd64\n# For M1 / ARM Macs\n[ $(uname -m) = arm64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.26.0/kind-darwin-arm64\nchmod +x ./kind\nmv ./kind /some-dir-in-your-PATH/kind\n```\n\nOn Windows:\n\n```powershell\ncurl.exe -Lo kind-windows-amd64.exe https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.26.0/kind-windows-amd64\nMove-Item .\\kind-windows-amd64.exe c:\\some-dir-in-your-PATH\\kind.exe\n\n# OR via Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/packages/kind)\nchoco install kind\n```\n\nTo use kind, you will need to [install docker].\nOnce you have docker running you can create a cluster with:\n\n```console\nkind create cluster\n```\n\nTo delete your cluster use:\n\n```console\nkind delete cluster\n```\n\n<!--TODO(bentheelder): improve this part of the guide-->\nTo create a cluster from Kubernetes source:\n- ensure that Kubernetes is cloned in `$(go env GOPATH)/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`\n- build a node image and create a cluster with:\n```console\nkind build node-image\nkind create cluster --image kindest/node:latest\n```\n\nMulti-node clusters and other advanced features may be configured with a config\nfile, for more usage see [the docs][user guide] or run `kind [command] --help`\n\n## Community\n\nPlease reach out for bugs, feature requests, and other issues!\nThe maintainers of this project are reachable via:\n\n- [Kubernetes Slack] in the [#kind] channel\n- [filing an issue] against this repo\n- The Kubernetes [SIG-Testing Mailing List]\n\nCurrent maintainers are [@aojea] and [@BenTheElder] - feel free to\nreach out if you have any questions!\n\nPull Requests are very welcome!\nIf you're planning a new feature, please file an issue to discuss first.\n\nCheck the [issue tracker] for `help wanted` issues if you're unsure where to\nstart, or feel free to reach out to discuss. ðŸ™‚\n\nSee also: our own [contributor guide] and the Kubernetes [community page].\n\n## Why kind?\n\n- kind supports multi-node (including HA) clusters\n- kind supports building Kubernetes release builds from source\n  - support for make / bash or docker, in addition to pre-published builds\n- kind supports Linux, macOS and Windows\n- kind is a [CNCF certified conformant Kubernetes installer](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=kind)\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nParticipation in the Kubernetes community is governed by the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct].\n\n<!--links-->\n[go]: https://golang.org/\n[go-supported]: https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy\n[docker]: https://www.docker.com/\n[podman]: https://podman.io/\n[nerdctl]: https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl\n[community page]: https://kubernetes.io/community/\n[Kubernetes Code of Conduct]: code-of-conduct.md\n[Go Report Card Badge]: https://goreportcard.com/badge/sigs.k8s.io/kind\n[Go Report Card]: https://goreportcard.com/report/sigs.k8s.io/kind\n[conformance tests]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md\n[packages]: ./pkg\n[cluster package]: ./pkg/cluster\n[build package]: ./pkg/build\n[kind cli]: ./main.go\n[images]: ./images\n[kubetest]: https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/kubetest\n[kubeadm]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm/\n[design doc]: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/design/initial\n[user guide]: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start\n[SIG-Testing Mailing List]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-testing\n[issue tracker]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues\n[filing an issue]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/new\n[Kubernetes Slack]: http://slack.k8s.io/\n[#kind]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CEKK1KTN2/\n[1.0 roadmap]: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/1.0-roadmap\n[install docker]: https://docs.docker.com/install/\n[@BenTheElder]: https://github.com/BenTheElder\n[@munnerz]: https://github.com/munnerz\n[@aojea]: https://github.com/aojea\n[@amwat]: https://github.com/amwat\n[contributor guide]: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/getting-started\n[releases]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases\n[install guide]: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation\n[modules]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules\n"
