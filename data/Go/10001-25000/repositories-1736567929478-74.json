The application is a\nweb-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.\n\nGoogle uses this application to demonstrate how developers can modernize enterprise applications using Google Cloud products, including: [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Cloud Service Mesh (CSM)](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [Cloud Operations](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations), [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner), [Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore), [AlloyDB](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb), and [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/). This application works on any Kubernetes cluster.\n\nIf you’re using this demo, please **★Star** this repository to show your interest!\n\n**Note to Googlers:** Please fill out the form at [go/microservices-demo](http://go/microservices-demo).\n\n## Architecture\n\n**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different\nlanguages that talk to each other over gRPC.\n\n[![Architecture of\nmicroservices](/docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)](/docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)\n\nFind **Protocol Buffers Descriptions** at the [`./protos` directory](/protos).\n\n| Service                                              | Language      | Description                                                                                                                       |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [frontend](/src/frontend)                           | Go            | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website.

Ensure you have the following requirements:\n   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).\n   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.\n\n2. Clone the latest major version.\n\n   ```sh\n   git clone --depth 1 --branch v0 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git\n   cd microservices-demo/\n   ```\n\n   The `--depth 1` argument skips downloading git history.\n\n3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.\n\n   ```sh\n   export PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>\n   export REGION=us-central1\n   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \\\n     --project=${PROJECT_ID}\n   ```\n\n   Substitute `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.\n\n4. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.\n\n   ```sh\n   gcloud container clusters create-auto online-boutique \\\n     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}\n   ```\n\n   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.\n\n5. Deploy Online Boutique to the cluster.\n\n   ```sh\n   kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml\n   ```\n\n6. Wait for the pods to be ready.\n\n   ```sh\n   kubectl get pods\n   ```\n\n   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:\n\n   ```\n   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n   adservice-76bdd69666-ckc5j               1/1     Running   0          2m58s\n   cartservice-66d497c6b7-dp5jr             1/1     Running   0          2m59s\n   checkoutservice-666c784bd6-4jd22         1/1     Running   0          3m1s\n   currencyservice-5d5d496984-4jmd7         1/1     Running   0          2m59s\n   emailservice-667457d9d6-75jcq            1/1     Running   0          3m2s\n   frontend-6b8d69b9fb-wjqdg                1/1     Running   0          3m1s\n   loadgenerator-665b5cd444-gwqdq           1/1     Running   0          3m\n   paymentservice-68596d6dd6-bf6bv          1/1     Running   0          3m\n   productcatalogservice-557d474574-888kr   1/1     Running   0          3m\n   recommendationservice-69c56b74d4-7z8r5   1/1     Running   0          3m1s\n   redis-cart-5f59546cdd-5jnqf              1/1     Running   0          2m58s\n   shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s\n   ```\n\n7. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's external IP.\n\n   ```sh\n   kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'\n   ```\n\n   Visit `http://EXTERNAL_IP` in a web browser to access your instance of Online Boutique.\n\n8. Congrats! You've deployed the default Online Boutique. To deploy a different variation of Online Boutique (e.g., with Google Cloud Operations tracing, Istio, etc.), see [Deploy Online Boutique variations with Kustomize](#deploy-online-boutique-variations-with-kustomize).\n\n9. Once you are done with it, delete the GKE cluster.\n\n   ```sh\n   gcloud container clusters delete online-boutique \\\n     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}\n   ```\n\n   Deleting the cluster may take a few minutes.\n\n## Additional deployment options\n\n- **Terraform**: [See these instructions](/terraform) to learn how to deploy Online Boutique using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro).\n- **Istio / Cloud Service Mesh**: [See these instructions](/kustomize/components/service-mesh-istio/README.md) to deploy Online Boutique alongside an Istio-backed service mesh.\n- **Non-GKE clusters (Minikube, Kind, etc)**: See the [Development guide](/docs/development-guide.md) to learn how you can deploy Online Boutique on non-GKE clusters.\n- **AI assistant using Gemini**: [See these instructions](/kustomize/components/shopping-assistant/README.md) to deploy a Gemini-powered AI assistant that suggests products to purchase based on an image.\n- **And more**: The [`/kustomize` directory](/kustomize) contains instructions for customizing the deployment of Online Boutique with other variations.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Development](/docs/development-guide.md) to learn how to run and develop this app locally.\n\n## Demos featuring Online Boutique\n\n- [Platform Engineering in action: Deploy the Online Boutique sample apps with Score and Humanitec](https://medium.com/p/d99101001e69)\n- [The new Kubernetes Gateway API with Istio and Anthos Service Mesh (ASM)](https://medium.com/p/9d64c7009cd)\n- [Use Azure Redis Cache with the Online Boutique sample on AKS](https://medium.com/p/981bd98b53f8)\n- [Sail Sharp, 8 tips to optimize and secure your .NET containers for Kubernetes](https://medium.com/p/c68ba253844a)\n- [Deploy multi-region application with Anthos and Google cloud Spanner](https://medium.com/google-cloud/a2ea3493ed0)\n- [Use Google Cloud Memorystore (Redis) with the Online Boutique sample on GKE](https://medium.com/p/82f7879a900d)\n- [Use Helm to simplify the deployment of Online Boutique, with a Service Mesh, GitOps, and more!](https://medium.com/p/246119e46d53)\n- [How to reduce microservices complexity with Apigee and Anthos Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-modernization/api-management-and-service-mesh-go-together)\n- [gRPC health probes with Kubernetes 1.24+](https://medium.com/p/b5bd26253a4c)\n- [Use Google Cloud Spanner with the Online Boutique sample](https://medium.com/p/f7248e077339)\n- [Seamlessly encrypt traffic from any apps in your Mesh to Memorystore (redis)](https://medium.com/google-cloud/64b71969318d)\n- [Strengthen your app's security with Cloud Service Mesh and Anthos Config Management](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/strengthen-app-security)\n- [From edge to mesh: Exposing service mesh applications through GKE Ingress](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/exposing-service-mesh-apps-through-gke-ingress)\n- [Take the first step toward SRE with Cloud Operations Sandbox](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/operations/on-the-road-to-sre-with-cloud-operations-sandbox)\n- [Deploying the Online Boutique sample application on Cloud Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/onlineboutique-install-kpt)\n- [Anthos Service Mesh Workshop: Lab Guide](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/anthos-service-mesh-workshop)\n- [KubeCon EU 2019 - Reinventing Networking: A Deep Dive into Istio's Multicluster Gateways - Steve Dake, Independent](https://youtu.be/-t2BfT59zJA?t=982)\n- Google Cloud Next'18 SF\n  - [Day 1 Keynote](https://youtu.be/vJ9OaAqfxo4?t=2416) showing GKE On-Prem\n  - [Day 3 Keynote](https://youtu.be/JQPOPV_VH5w?t=815) showing Stackdriver\n    APM (Tracing, Code Search, Profiler, Google Cloud Build)\n  - [Introduction to Service Management with Istio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCJrdKdD6UM&feature=youtu.be&t=586)\n- [Google Cloud Next'18 London – Keynote](https://youtu.be/nIq2pkNcfEI?t=3071)\n  showing Stackdriver Incident Response Management\n"
