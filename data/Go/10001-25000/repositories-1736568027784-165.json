          "content": "# CoreDNS Governance\n\n## Principles\n\nThe CoreDNS community adheres to the following principles:\n\n- Open: CoreDNS is open source, advertised on [our website](https://coredns.io/community).\n- Welcoming and respectful: See [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n- Transparent and accessible: Changes to the CoreDNS organization, CoreDNS code repositories, and CNCF related activities (e.g. level, involvement, etc) are done in public.\n- Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with\n  project objectives, scope, and design principles.\n\n## Project Steering Committee\n\nThe CoreDNS project has a project steering committee consisting of 5 members, with a maximum of 1 member from any single organization.\nThe steering committee in CoreDNS has a final say in any decision concerning the CoreDNS project, with the exceptions of\ndeciding steering committee membership, and changes to project governance. See `Changes in Project Steering Committee Membership`\nand `Changes in Project Governance`.\n\nAny decision made must not conflict with CNCF policy.\n\nThe maximum term length of each steering committee member is one year, with no term limit restriction.\n\nSteering committee member are elected by CoreDNS maintainers.\n\nThe steering committee members are identified in the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file.\n\n## Expectations from Maintainers\n\nEvery one carries water...\n\nMaking a community work requires input/effort from everyone. Maintainers should actively\nparticipate in Pull Request reviews. Maintainers are expected to respond to assigned Pull Requests\nin a *reasonable* time frame, either providing insights, or assign the Pull Requests to other\nmaintainers.\n\nEvery Maintainer is listed in the\n[CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/master/CODEOWNERS)\nfile, with their GitHub handle.\n\nA Maintainer should be a member of `maintainers@coredns.io`, although this is not a hard requirement.\n\n## Becoming a Maintainer\n\nOn successful merge of a significant pull request any current maintainer can reach\nto the author behind the pull request and ask them if they are willing to become a CoreDNS\nmaintainer. The email of the new maintainer invitation should be cc'ed to `maintainers@coredns.io`\nas part of the process.\n\n## Changes in Maintainership\n\nIf a Maintainer feels she/he can not fulfill the \"Expectations from Maintainers\", they are free to\nstep down.\n\nThe CoreDNS organization will never forcefully remove a current Maintainer, unless a maintainer\nfails to meet the principles of CoreDNS community, or adhere to the [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Changes in Project Steering Committee Membership\n\nChanges to the project steering committee membership are initiated by opening a separate GitHub PR updating\nthe [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file for each steering committee member candidate.\n\nAnyone from the CoreDNS community can vote on the PR with either +1 or -1.\n\nOnly the following votes are binding:\n1) Any maintainer that has been listed in the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file before the PR is opened.\n2) Any maintainer from an organization may cast the vote for that organization. However, no organization\nshould have more binding votes than 1/5 of the total number of maintainers defined in 1).\n\nThe PR should be opened no earlier than 6 weeks before the end of affected committee member's term.\nThe PR should be kept open for no less than 4 weeks. The PR can only be merged after the end of the\nreplaced committee member's term, with more +1 than -1 in the binding votes.\n\nWhen there are conflicting PRs for changes to a project committee member, the PR with the most\nbinding +1 votes is merged.\n\nDuring a vote there may be several candidates running for multiple committee seat vacancies. Maintainers and\ncommunity members should cast a single vote per vacancy (although this does not need to be enforced). At the end of the\nvoting period, candidates with the most binding votes will fill the vacancies. In the event of a\nmulti-way tie for a set of remaining vacancies, the candidates who have been maintainers longest have precedence.\n\nA project steering committee member may volunteer to step down, ending their term early.\n\n## Changes in Project Governance\n\nChanges in project governance (GOVERNANCE.md) can be initiated by opening a GitHub PR.\nThe PR should only be opened no earlier than 6 weeks before the end of a committee member's term.\nThe PR should be kept open for no less than 4 weeks. The PR can only be merged following the same\nvoting process as in `Changes in Project Steering Committee Membership`.\n\n## Decision-making process\n\nDecisions are build on consensus between maintainers.\nProposals and ideas can either be submitted for agreement via a GitHub issue or PR,\nor by sending an email to `maintainers@coredns.io`.\n\nIn general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out between the persons involved.\nIf a dispute cannot be resolved independently, get a third-party maintainer (e.g. a mutual contact with some background\non the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.\nIf a dispute still cannot be resolved, the project steering committee has the final say to decide an issue.\nThe project steering committee may reach this decision by consensus or else by a simple majority vote among committee\nmembers if necessary.  The steering should committee endeavor to make this decision within a reasonable amount of time,\nnot to extend longer than two weeks.\n\nThe decision-making process should be transparent to adhere to the CoreDNS Code of Conduct.\n\nAll proposals, ideas, and decisions by maintainers or the steering committee\nshould either be part of a GitHub issue or PR, or be sent to `maintainers@coredns.io`.\n\n## GitHub Project Administration\n\nThe __coredns__ GitHub project maintainers team reflects the list of Maintainers.\n\n## Other Projects\n\nThe CoreDNS organization is open to receive new sub-projects under its umbrella. To accept a project\ninto the __CoreDNS__ organization, it has to meet the following criteria:\n\n- Must be licensed under the terms of the Apache License v2.0\n- Must be related to one or more scopes of the CoreDNS ecosystem:\n  - CoreDNS project artifacts (website, deployments, CI, etc)\n  - External plugins\n  - Other DNS related processing\n- Must be supported by a Maintainer not associated or affiliated with the author(s) of the sub-projects\n\nThe submission process starts as a Pull Request or Issue on the\n[coredns/coredns](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) repository with the required information\nmentioned above. Once a project is accepted, it's considered a __CNCF sub-project under the umbrella\nof CoreDNS__.\n\n## New Plugins\n\nThe CoreDNS is open to receive new plugins as part of the CoreDNS repo. The submission process\nis the same as a Pull Request submission. Unlike small Pull Requests though, a new plugin submission\nshould only be approved by a maintainer not associated or affiliated with the author(s) of the\nplugin.\n\n## CoreDNS and CNCF\n\nCoreDNS is a CNCF project. As such, CoreDNS might be involved in CNCF (or other CNCF projects) related\nmarketing, events, or activities. Any maintainer may participate in these activities, as long as\nshe/he sends email to `maintainers@coredns.io` (or create a GitHub Pull Request) to call for participation\nfrom other maintainers. The `Call for Participation` should be kept open for no less than a week if time\npermits, or a _reasonable_ time frame to allow maintainers to have a chance to volunteer.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThe [CoreDNS Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is aligned with the CNCF Code of Conduct.\n\n## Credits\n\nSections of this documents have been borrowed from [Fluentd](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md) and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md) projects.\n"

The key word here is *flexible*: with CoreDNS you\nare able to do what you want with your DNS data by utilizing plugins. If some functionality is not\nprovided out of the box you can add it by [writing a plugin](https://coredns.io/explugins).\n\nCoreDNS can listen for DNS requests coming in over:\n* UDP/TCP (go'old DNS).\n* TLS - DoT ([RFC 7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)).\n* DNS over HTTP/2 - DoH ([RFC 8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484)).\n* DNS over QUIC - DoQ ([RFC 9250](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9250)). \n* [gRPC](https://grpc.io) (not a standard).\n\nCurrently CoreDNS is able to:\n\n* Serve zone data from a file; both DNSSEC (NSEC only) and DNS are supported (*file* and *auto*).\n* Retrieve zone data from primaries, i.e., act as a secondary server (AXFR only) (*secondary*).\n* Sign zone data on-the-fly (*dnssec*).\n* Load balancing of responses (*loadbalance*).\n* Allow for zone transfers, i.e., act as a primary server (*file* + *transfer*).\n* Automatically load zone files from disk (*auto*).\n* Caching of DNS responses (*cache*).\n* Use etcd as a backend (replacing [SkyDNS](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns)) (*etcd*).\n* Use k8s (kubernetes) as a backend (*kubernetes*).\n* Serve as a proxy to forward queries to some other (recursive) nameserver (*forward*).\n* Provide metrics (by using Prometheus) (*prometheus*).\n* Provide query (*log*) and error (*errors*) logging.\n* Integrate with cloud providers (*route53*).\n* Support the CH class: `version.bind` and friends (*chaos*).\n* Support the RFC 5001 DNS name server identifier (NSID) option (*nsid*).\n* Profiling support (*pprof*).\n* Rewrite queries (qtype, qclass and qname) (*rewrite* and *template*).\n* Block ANY queries (*any*).\n* Provide DNS64 IPv6 Translation (*dns64*).\n\nAnd more. Each of the plugins is documented. See [coredns.io/plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins)\nfor all in-tree plugins, and [coredns.io/explugins](https://coredns.io/explugins) for all\nout-of-tree plugins.\n\n## Compilation from Source\n\nTo compile CoreDNS, we assume you have a working Go setup. See various tutorials if you don’t have\nthat already configured.\n\nFirst, make sure your golang version is 1.21 or higher as `go mod` support and other api is needed.\nSee [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for `go mod` details.\nThen, check out the project and run `make` to compile the binary:\n\n~~~\n$ git clone https://github.com/coredns/coredns\n$ cd coredns\n$ make\n~~~\n\nThis should yield a `coredns` binary.\n\n## Compilation with Docker\n\nCoreDNS requires Go to compile. However, if you already have docker installed and prefer not to\nsetup a Go environment, you could build CoreDNS easily:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -i -t \\\n    -v $PWD:/go/src/github.com/coredns/coredns -w /go/src/github.com/coredns/coredns \\\n        golang:1.22 sh -c 'GOFLAGS=\"-buildvcs=false\" make gen && GOFLAGS=\"-buildvcs=false\" make'\n```\n\nThe above command alone will have `coredns` binary generated.\n\n## Examples\n\nWhen starting CoreDNS without any configuration, it loads the\n[*whoami*](https://coredns.io/plugins/whoami) and [*log*](https://coredns.io/plugins/log) plugins\nand starts listening on port 53 (override with `-dns.port`), it should show the following:\n\n~~~ txt\n.:53\nCoreDNS-1.6.6\nlinux/amd64, go1.16.10, aa8c32\n~~~\n\nThe following could be used to query the CoreDNS server that is running now:\n\n~~~ txt\ndig @127.0.0.1 -p 53 www.example.com\n~~~\n\nAny query sent to port 53 should return some information; your sending address, port and protocol\nused. The query should also be logged to standard output.\n\nThe configuration of CoreDNS is done through a file named `Corefile`. When CoreDNS starts, it will\nlook for the `Corefile` from the current working directory. A `Corefile` for CoreDNS server that listens\non port `53` and enables `whoami` plugin is:\n\n~~~ corefile\n.:53 {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\n\nSometimes port number 53 is occupied by system processes. In that case you can start the CoreDNS server\nwhile modifying the `Corefile` as given below so that the CoreDNS server starts on port 1053.\n\n~~~ corefile\n.:1053 {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\n\nIf you have a `Corefile` without a port number specified it will, by default, use port 53, but you can\noverride the port with the `-dns.port` flag: `coredns -dns.port 1053`, runs the server on port 1053.\n\nYou may import other text files into the `Corefile` using the _import_ directive.  You can use globs to match multiple\nfiles with a single _import_ directive.\n\n~~~ txt\n.:53 {\n    import example1.txt\n}\nimport example2.txt\n~~~\n\nYou can use environment variables in the `Corefile` with `{$VARIABLE}`.  Note that each environment variable is inserted\ninto the `Corefile` as a single token. For example, an environment variable with a space in it will be treated as a single\ntoken, not as two separate tokens.\n\n~~~ txt\n.:53 {\n    {$ENV_VAR}\n}\n~~~\n\nA Corefile for a CoreDNS server that forward any queries to an upstream DNS (e.g., `8.8.8.8`) is as follows:\n\n~~~ corefile\n.:53 {\n    forward . 8.8.8.8:53\n    log\n}\n~~~\n\nStart CoreDNS and then query on that port (53). The query should be forwarded to 8.8.8.8 and the\nresponse will be returned. Each query should also show up in the log which is printed on standard\noutput.\n\nTo serve the (NSEC) DNSSEC-signed `example.org` on port 1053, with errors and logging sent to standard\noutput. Allow zone transfers to everybody, but specifically mention 1 IP address so that CoreDNS can\nsend notifies to it.\n\n~~~ txt\nexample.org:1053 {\n    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed\n    transfer {\n        to * 2001:500:8f::53\n    }\n    errors\n    log\n}\n~~~\n\nServe `example.org` on port 1053, but forward everything that does *not* match `example.org` to a\nrecursive nameserver *and* rewrite ANY queries to HINFO.\n\n~~~ txt\nexample.org:1053 {\n    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed\n    transfer {\n        to * 2001:500:8f::53\n    }\n    errors\n    log\n}\n\n. {\n    any\n    forward . 8.8.8.8:53\n    errors\n    log\n}\n~~~\n\nIP addresses are also allowed. They are automatically converted to reverse zones:\n\n~~~ corefile\n10.0.0.0/24 {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\nMeans you are authoritative for `0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.`.\n\nThis also works for IPv6 addresses. If for some reason you want to serve a zone named `10.0.0.0/24`\nadd the closing dot: `10.0.0.0/24.` as this also stops the conversion.\n\nThis even works for CIDR (See RFC 1518 and 1519) addressing, i.e. `10.0.0.0/25`, CoreDNS will then\ncheck if the `in-addr` request falls in the correct range.\n\nListening on TLS (DoT) and for gRPC? Use:\n\n~~~ corefile\ntls://example.org grpc://example.org {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\n\nSimilarly, for QUIC (DoQ):\n\n~~~ corefile\nquic://example.org {\n    whoami\n    tls mycert mykey\n}\n~~~\n\nAnd for DNS over HTTP/2 (DoH) use:\n\n~~~ corefile\nhttps://example.org {\n    whoami\n    tls mycert mykey\n}\n~~~\nin this setup, the CoreDNS will be responsible for TLS termination\n\nyou can also start DNS server serving DoH without TLS termination (plain HTTP), but beware that in such scenario there has to be some kind\nof TLS termination proxy before CoreDNS instance, which forwards DNS requests otherwise clients will not be able to communicate via DoH with the server\n~~~ corefile\nhttps://example.org {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\n\nSpecifying ports works in the same way:\n\n~~~ txt\ngrpc://example.org:1443 https://example.org:1444 {\n    # ...\n}\n~~~\n\nWhen no transport protocol is specified the default `dns://` is assumed.\n\n## Community\n\nWe're most active on GitHub (and Slack):\n\n- GitHub: <https://github.com/coredns/coredns>\n- Slack: #coredns on <https://slack.cncf.io>\n\nMore resources can be found:\n\n- Website: <https://coredns.io>\n- Blog: <https://coredns.io/blog/>\n- Twitter: [@corednsio](https://twitter.com/corednsio)\n- Mailing list/group: <coredns-discuss@googlegroups.com> (not very active)\n\n## Contribution guidelines\n\nIf you want to contribute to CoreDNS, be sure to review the [contribution\nguidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Deployment\n\nExamples for deployment via systemd and other use cases can be found in the [deployment\nrepository](https://github.com/coredns/deployment).\n\n## Deprecation Policy\n\nWhen there is a backwards incompatible change in CoreDNS the following process is followed:\n\n*  Release x.y.z: Announce that in the next release we will make backward incompatible changes.\n*  Release x.y+1.0: Increase the minor version and set the patch version to 0. Make the changes,\n   but allow the old configuration to be parsed. I.e. CoreDNS will start from an unchanged\n   Corefile.\n*  Release x.y+1.1: Increase the patch version to 1. Remove the lenient parsing, so CoreDNS will\n   not start if those features are still used.\n\nE.g. 1.3.1 announce a change. 1.4.0 a new release with the change but backward compatible config.\nAnd finally 1.4.1 that removes the config workarounds.\n\n## Security\n\n### Security Audits\n\nThird party security audits have been performed by:\n* [Cure53](https://cure53.de) in March 2018.

The syntax is as follows:\n\n~~~ txt\n[SCHEME://]ZONE [[SCHEME://]ZONE]...[:PORT] {\n    [PLUGIN]...\n}\n~~~\n\nThe **ZONE** defines for which name this server should be called, multiple zones are allowed and\nshould be *white space* separated. You can use a \"reverse\" syntax to specify a reverse zone (i.e.\nip6.arpa and in-addr.arpa), by using an IP address in the CIDR notation.\n\nThe optional **SCHEME** defaults to `dns://`, but can also be `tls://` (DNS over TLS), `grpc://`\n(DNS over gRPC) or `https://` (DNS over HTTP/2).\n\nThe optional **PORT** controls on which port the server will bind, this default to 53. If you use\na port number here, you *can't* override it with `-dns.port` (coredns(1)), also see coredns-bind(7).\n\nSpecifying a **ZONE** *and* **PORT** combination multiple times for *different* servers will lead to\nan error on startup.\n\nWhen a query comes in, it is matched again all zones for all servers, the server with the longest\nmatch on the query name will receive the query.\n\n**PLUGIN** defines the plugin(s) we want to load into this server. This is optional as well, but as\nserver with no plugins will just return SERVFAIL for all queries. Each plugin can have a number of\nproperties than can have arguments, see the documentation for each plugin.\n\nComments are allowed and begin with an unquoted hash `#` and continue to the end of the line.\nComments may be started anywhere on a line.\n\nEnvironment variables are supported and either the Unix or Windows form may be used: `{$ENV_VAR_1}`\nor `{%ENV_VAR_2%}`.\n\nYou can use the `import` \"plugin\" (See coredns-import(7)) to include parts of other files.\n\nIf CoreDNS can’t find a Corefile to load it loads the following builtin one:\n\n~~~ corefile\n. {\n    whoami\n    log\n}\n~~~\n\n## Import\n\nYou can use the `import` \"plugin\" to include parts of other files, see\n<https://coredns.io/plugins/import>, and coredns-import(7).\n\n## Snippets\n\nIf you want to reuse a snippet you can define one with and then use it with *import*.\n\n~~~ corefile\n(mysnippet) {\n    log\n    whoami\n}\n\n. {\n    import mysnippet\n}\n~~~\n\n## Examples\n\nThe **ZONE** is root zone `.`, the **PLUGIN** is *chaos*. The *chaos* plugin takes an (optional) argument:\n`CoreDNS-001`. This text is returned on a CH class query: `dig CH TXT version.bind @localhost`.\n\n~~~ corefile\n. {\n   chaos CoreDNS-001\n}\n~~~\n\nWhen defining a new zone, you either create a new server, or add it to an existing one. Here we\ndefine one server that handles two zones; that potentially chain different plugins:\n\n~~~ corefile\nexample.org {\n    whoami\n}\norg {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\n\nIs identical to:\n\n~~~ corefile\nexample.org org {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\n\nReverse zones can be specified as domain names:\n\n~~~ corefile\n0.0.10.in-addr.arpa {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\n\nor by just using the CIDR notation:\n\n~~~ corefile\n10.0.0.0/24 {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\n\nThis also works on a non octet boundary:\n\n~~~ corefile\n10.0.0.0/27 {\n    whoami\n}\n~~~\n\n## Authors\n\nCoreDNS Authors.\n\n## Copyright\n\nApache License 2.0\n\n## See Also\n\nThe manual page for CoreDNS: coredns(1) and more documentation on <https://coredns.io>.\nAlso see the [*import*](https://coredns.io/plugins/import)'s documentation and all the manual pages\nfor the plugins.\n"

          "content": "# Plugins\n\n## Writing Plugins\n\nThe main method that gets called is `ServeDNS`. It has three parameters:\n\n* a `context.Context`;\n* `dns.ResponseWriter` that is, basically, the client's connection;\n* `*dns.Msg` the request from the client.\n\n`ServeDNS` returns two values, a response code and an error. If the error is not nil, CoreDNS\nwill return a SERVFAIL to the client. The response code tells CoreDNS if a *reply has been\nwritten by the plugin chain or not*. In the latter case CoreDNS will take care of that.\n\nCoreDNS treats:\n\n* SERVFAIL (dns.RcodeServerFailure)\n* REFUSED (dns.RcodeRefused)\n* FORMERR (dns.RcodeFormatError)\n* NOTIMP (dns.RcodeNotImplemented)\n\nas special and will then assume *nothing* has been written to the client. In all other cases it\nassumes something has been written to the client (by the plugin).\n\nThe [*example*](https://github.com/coredns/example) plugin shows a bare-bones implementation that\ncan be used as a starting point for your plugin. This plugin has tests and extensive comments in the\ncode.\n\n## Hooking It Up\n\nSee a couple of blog posts on how to write and add plugin to CoreDNS:\n\n* <https://coredns.io/2017/03/01/how-to-add-plugins-to-coredns/>\n* <https://coredns.io/2016/12/19/writing-plugins-for-coredns/>, slightly older, but useful.\n\n## Logging\n\nIf your plugin needs to output a log line you should use the `plugin/pkg/log` package. This package\nimplements log levels. The standard way of outputting is: `log.Info` for info level messages. The\nlevels available are `log.Info`, `log.Warning`, `log.Error`, `log.Debug`. Each of these also has\na `f` variant. The plugin's name should be included, by using the log package like so:\n\n~~~ go\nimport clog \"github.com/coredns/coredns/plugin/pkg/log\"\n\nvar log = clog.NewWithPlugin(\"whoami\")\n\nlog.Info(\"message\") // outputs: [INFO] plugin/whoami: message\n~~~\n\nIn general, logging should be left to the higher layers by returning an error. However, if there is\na reason to consume the error and notify the user, then logging in the plugin itself can be\nacceptable. The `Debug*` functions only output something when the *debug* plugin is loaded in the\nserver.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWhen exporting metrics the *Namespace* should be `plugin.Namespace` (=\"coredns\"), and the\n*Subsystem* must be the name of the plugin. The README.md for the plugin should then also contain\na *Metrics* section detailing the metrics.\n\n## Readiness\n\nIf the plugin supports signalling readiness it should have a *Ready* section detailing how it\nworks, and implement the `ready.Readiness` interface.\n\n## Opening Sockets\n\nSee the plugin/pkg/reuseport for `Listen` and `ListenPacket` functions. Using these functions makes\nyour plugin handle reload events better.\n\n## Context\n\nEvery request get a context.Context these are pre-filled with 2 values:\n\n* `Key`: holds a pointer to the current server, this can be useful for logging or metrics. It is\n  infact used in the *metrics* plugin to tie a request to a specific (internal) server.\n* `LoopKey`: holds an integer to detect loops within the current context. The *file* plugin uses\n  this to detect loops when resolving CNAMEs.\n\n## Documentation\n\nEach plugin should have a README.md explaining what the plugin does and how it is configured. The\nfile should have the following layout:\n\n* Title: use the plugin's name\n* Subsection titled: \"Name\"\n    with *PLUGIN* - one line description.\n* Subsection titled: \"Description\" has a longer description.\n* Subsection titled: \"Syntax\", syntax and supported directives.\n* Subsection titled: \"Examples\"\n\nMore sections are of course possible.\n\n### Style\n\nWe use the Unix manual page style:\n\n* The name of plugin in the running text should be italic: *plugin*.\n* all CAPITAL: user supplied argument, in the running text references this use strong text: `**`:\n  **EXAMPLE**.\n* Optional text: in block quotes: `[optional]`.\n* Use three dots to indicate multiple options are allowed: `arg...`.\n* Item used literal: `literal`.\n\n### Example Domain Names\n\nPlease be sure to use `example.org` or `example.net` in any examples and tests you provide. These\nare the standard domain names created for this purpose.\n\n## Fallthrough\n\nIn a perfect world the following would be true for plugin: \"Either you are responsible for a zone or\nnot\". If the answer is \"not\", the plugin should call the next plugin in the chain. If \"yes\" it\nshould handle *all* names that fall in this zone and the names below - i.e. it should handle the\nentire domain and all sub domains.\n\n~~~ txt\n. {\n    file example.org db.example\n}\n~~~\n\nIn this example the *file* plugin is handling all names below (and including) `example.org`. If\na query comes in that is not a subdomain (or equal to) `example.org` the next plugin is called.\n\nNow, the world isn't perfect, and there are may be reasons to \"fallthrough\" to the next plugin,\nmeaning a plugin is only responsible for a *subset* of names within the zone.\n\nThe `fallthrough` directive should optionally accept a list of zones. Only queries for records\nin one of those zones should be allowed to fallthrough. See `plugin/pkg/fallthrough` for the\nimplementation.\n\n## Mutating a Response\n\nUsing a custom `ResponseWriter`, a plugin can mutate a response when another plugin further down the chain writes the response to the client.\nIf a plugin mutates a response it MUST make a copy of the entire response before doing so. A\nresponse is a pointer to a `dns.Msg` and as such you will be manipulating the original response,\nwhich could have been generated from a data store. E.g. the *file* plugin creates a response that\nthe *rewrite* plugin then rewrites; not copying the data, means it's **also** mutating the data of\nthe *file*'s data store. A response can be copied by using the `Copy()` method.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\nSome general guidelines:\n\n* logging time duration should be done in seconds (call the `Seconds()` method on any duration).\n* keep logging to a minimum.\n* call the main config parse function just `parse`.\n* try to minimize the number of knobs in the configuration.\n* use `plugin.Error()` to wrap errors returned from the `setup` function.\n\n## Qualifying for Main Repo\n\nPlugins for CoreDNS can live out-of-tree, `plugin.cfg` defaults to CoreDNS' repo but other\nrepos work just as well. So when do we consider the inclusion of a new plugin in the main repo?\n\n* First, the plugin should be useful for other people. \"Useful\" is a subjective term. We will\n  probably need to further refine this.\n* It should be sufficiently different from other plugin to warrant inclusion.\n* Current internet standards need be supported: IPv4 and IPv6, so A and AAAA records should be\n  handled (if your plugin is in the business of dealing with address records that is).\n* It must have tests.\n* It must have a README.md for documentation.\n"
