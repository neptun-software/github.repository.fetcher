Exchange the URL in [DefaultAgentDownloadURL](./pkg/agent/agent.go) with a\n      custom public repository release you have created.\n   2. Build devpod via: `./hack/rebuild.sh`\n   3. Upload `test/devpod-linux-amd64` and `test/devpod-linux-arm64` to the public\n      repository release assets.\n3. Build devpod via: `./hack/rebuild.sh` (asking for sudo password)\n4. Add docker provider via `devpod provider add docker`\n5. Configure docker provider via `devpod use provider docker`\n6. Start devpod in vscode with `devpod up examples/simple`\n\n## Build from source\n\nPrerequisites CLI:\n\n- [Go 1.20](https://go.dev/doc/install)\n\nOnce installed, run\n`CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags \"-s -w\" -o devpod-cli`\n\nPrerequisites GUI:\n\n- [NodeJS + yarn](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)\n\nTo build the app on Linux, you will need the following dependencies:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install libappindicator3-1 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libbsd0 libxdmcp6 \\\n  libwmf-0.2-7 libwmf-0.2-7-gtk libgtk-3-0 libwmf-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37 \\\n  librust-openssl-sys-dev librust-glib-sys-dev\nsudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \\\n  libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev\n```\n\nOnce installed, run\n\n- `cd desktop`\n- `yarn tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri-dev.conf.json`\n\nThe application should be in `desktop/src-tauri/target/release`\n\n## Provider\n\nHead over to [the docs](https://devpod.sh/docs/developing-providers/quickstart)\nfor an introduction into developing your own providers\n\n### Publish your provider\n\nOnce you're provider is ready, update\n\n- `community.yaml`\n- `docs/pages/managing-providers/add-provider.mdx`\n\nto get your provider featured both in the documentation and the UI\n\n## Deeplinks\n\nDevPod Desktop can handle deep links to perform various actions, like opening or\nimporting workspaces.\nThe scheme is:\n\nprotocol: `devpod://`\nhost: `command`\nsearchParams: `foo=bar&fizz=buzz`\n\nresulting in a full url string of `devpod://command?foo=bar&fizz=buzz`. For more\ninformation, take a look at the indvidual command sections below.\n\n### Open Workspace\n\nOpen a workspace based on a workspace source. Similar to `devpod up`, but shareable\n\nhost: `open`\nsearchParams: `source` (required), `workspace`, `provider`, `ide`\n\n`devpod://open?source=your-url-encoded-source&workspace=my-workspace&provider=docker&ide=vscode`\n\n### Import Workspace\n\nImport a remote DevPod.Pro workspace into your local client\n\nhost: `import`\nsearchParams: `workspace_id` (required), `workspace_uid` (required),\n`devpod_pro_host` (required), `options`\n"

You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

Each developer environment runs in a container and is specified through a [devcontainer.json](https://containers.dev/). Through DevPod providers, these environments can be created on any backend, such as the local computer, a Kubernetes cluster, any reachable remote machine, or in a VM in the cloud.\n\n![Codespaces](docs/static/media/codespaces-but.png)\n\nYou can think of DevPod as the glue that connects your local IDE to a machine where you want to develop. So depending on the requirements of your project, you can either create a workspace locally on the computer, on a beefy cloud machine with many GPUs, or a spare remote computer. Within DevPod, every workspace is managed the same way, which also makes it easy to switch between workspaces that might be hosted somewhere else.\n\n![DevPod Flow](docs/static/media/devpod-flow.gif)\n\n## Quickstart\n\nDownload DevPod Desktop:\n- [MacOS Silicon/ARM](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod/releases/latest/download/DevPod_macos_aarch64.dmg)\n- [MacOS Intel/AMD](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod/releases/latest/download/DevPod_macos_x64.dmg)\n- [Windows](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod/releases/latest/download/DevPod_windows_x64_en-US.msi)\n- [Linux AppImage](https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod/releases/latest/download/DevPod_linux_amd64.AppImage)\n\nTake a look at the [DevPod Docs](https://devpod.sh/docs/getting-started/install) for more information.\n\n## Why DevPod?\n\nDevPod reuses the open [DevContainer standard](https://containers.dev/) (used by GitHub Codespaces and VSCode DevContainers) to create a consistent developer experience no matter what backend you want to use.\n\nCompared to hosted services such as Github Codespaces, JetBrains Spaces, or Google Cloud Workstations, DevPod has the following advantages:\n* **Cost savings**: DevPod is usually around 5-10 times cheaper than existing services with comparable feature sets because it uses bare virtual machines in any cloud and shuts down unused virtual machines automatically.\n* **No vendor lock-in**: Choose whatever cloud provider suits you best, be it the cheapest one or the most powerful, DevPod supports all cloud providers. If you are tired of using a provider, change it with a single command.\n* **Local development**: You get the same developer experience also locally, so you don't need to rely on a cloud provider at all.\n* **Cross IDE support**: VSCode and the full JetBrains suite is supported, all others can be connected through simple ssh.\n* **Client-only**: No need to install a server backend, DevPod runs only on your computer.\n* **Open-Source**: DevPod is 100% open-source and extensible. A provider doesn't exist? Just create your own.\n* **Rich feature set**: DevPod already supports prebuilds, auto inactivity shutdown, git & docker credentials sync, and many more features to come.\n* **Desktop App**: DevPod comes with an easy-to-use desktop application that abstracts all the complexity away. If you want to build your own integration, DevPod offers a feature-rich CLI as well.\n"
