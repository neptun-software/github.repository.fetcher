Testify is widely used, so each\ncontribution has a significant impact within the Golang community! Below you'll find everything you\nneed to know to get up to speed on the project.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThe Testify maintainers generally attempt to follow widely accepted practices within the Golang\ncommunity. That being said, the first priority is always to make sure that the package is useful to\nthe community. A few general guidelines are listed here:\n\n*Keep it simple (whenever practical)* - Try not to expand the API unless the new surface area\nprovides meaningful benefits. For example, don't add functions because they might be useful to\nsomeone, someday. Add what is useful to specific users, today.\n\n*Ease of use is paramount* - This means good documentation and package organization. It also means\nthat we should try hard to use meaningful, descriptive function names, avoid breaking the API\nunnecessarily, and try not to surprise the user.\n\n*Quality isn't an afterthought* - Testify is a testing library, so it seems reasonable that we\nshould have a decent test suite. This is doubly important because a bug in Testify doesn't just mean\na bug in our users' code, it means a bug in our users' tests, which means a potentially unnoticed\nand hard-to-find bug in our users' code.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nWe welcome pull requests! Please include the following in the description:\n\n  * Motivation, why your change is important or helpful\n  * Example usage (if applicable)\n  * Whether you intend to add / change behavior or fix a bug\n\nPlease be aware that the maintainers may ask for changes. This isn't a commentary on the quality of\nyour idea or your code. Testify is the result of many contributions from many individuals, so we\nneed to enforce certain practices and patterns to keep the package easy for others to understand.\nEssentially, we recognize that there are often many good ways to do a given thing, but we have to\npick one and stick with it.\n\nSee `MAINTAINERS.md` for a list of users who can approve / merge your changes.\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you find a bug or think of a useful feature you'd like to see added to Testify, the best thing\nyou can do is make the necessary changes and open a pull request (see above). If that isn't an\noption, or if you'd like to discuss your change before you write the code, open an issue!\n\nPlease provide enough context in the issue description that other members of the community can\neasily understand what it is that you'd like to see.\n\n"

This is how it writes the errors out through the normal `go test` capabilities.\n  * Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.\n\nif you assert many times, use the below:\n\n```go\npackage yours\n\nimport (\n  \"testing\"\n  \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n)\n\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n  assert := assert.New(t)\n\n  // assert equality\n  assert.Equal(123, 123, \"they should be equal\")\n\n  // assert inequality\n  assert.NotEqual(123, 456, \"they should not be equal\")\n\n  // assert for nil (good for errors)\n  assert.Nil(object)\n\n  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)\n  if assert.NotNil(object) {\n\n    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make\n    // further assertions without causing any errors\n    assert.Equal(\"Something\", object.Value)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[`require`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/require \"API documentation\") package\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe `require` package provides same global functions as the `assert` package, but instead of returning a boolean result they terminate current test.\nThese functions must be called from the goroutine running the test or benchmark function, not from other goroutines created during the test.\nOtherwise race conditions may occur.\n\nSee [t.FailNow](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.FailNow) for details.\n\n[`mock`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock \"API documentation\") package\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe `mock` package provides a mechanism for easily writing mock objects that can be used in place of real objects when writing test code.\n\nAn example test function that tests a piece of code that relies on an external object `testObj`, can set up expectations (testify) and assert that they indeed happened:\n\n```go\npackage yours\n\nimport (\n  \"testing\"\n  \"github.com/stretchr/testify/mock\"\n)\n\n/*\n  Test objects\n*/\n\n// MyMockedObject is a mocked object that implements an interface\n// that describes an object that the code I am testing relies on.\ntype MyMockedObject struct{\n  mock.Mock\n}\n\n// DoSomething is a method on MyMockedObject that implements some interface\n// and just records the activity, and returns what the Mock object tells it to.\n//\n// In the real object, this method would do something useful, but since this\n// is a mocked object - we're just going to stub it out.\n//\n// NOTE: This method is not being tested here, code that uses this object is.\nfunc (m *MyMockedObject) DoSomething(number int) (bool, error) {\n\n  args := m.Called(number)\n  return args.Bool(0), args.Error(1)\n\n}\n\n/*\n  Actual test functions\n*/\n\n// TestSomething is an example of how to use our test object to\n// make assertions about some target code we are testing.\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n\n  // create an instance of our test object\n  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)\n\n  // set up expectations\n  testObj.On(\"DoSomething\", 123).Return(true, nil)\n\n  // call the code we are testing\n  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)\n\n  // assert that the expectations were met\n  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)\n\n\n}\n\n// TestSomethingWithPlaceholder is a second example of how to use our test object to\n// make assertions about some target code we are testing.\n// This time using a placeholder. Placeholders might be used when the\n// data being passed in is normally dynamically generated and cannot be\n// predicted beforehand (eg. containing hashes that are time sensitive)\nfunc TestSomethingWithPlaceholder(t *testing.T) {\n\n  // create an instance of our test object\n  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)\n\n  // set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list\n  testObj.On(\"DoSomething\", mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)\n\n  // call the code we are testing\n  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)\n\n  // assert that the expectations were met\n  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)\n\n\n}\n\n// TestSomethingElse2 is a third example that shows how you can use\n// the Unset method to cleanup handlers and then add new ones.\nfunc TestSomethingElse2(t *testing.T) {\n\n  // create an instance of our test object\n  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)\n\n  // set up expectations with a placeholder in the argument list\n  mockCall := testObj.On(\"DoSomething\", mock.Anything).Return(true, nil)\n\n  // call the code we are testing\n  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)\n\n  // assert that the expectations were met\n  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)\n\n  // remove the handler now so we can add another one that takes precedence\n  mockCall.Unset()\n\n  // return false now instead of true\n  testObj.On(\"DoSomething\", mock.Anything).Return(false, nil)\n\n  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on how to write mock code, check out the [API documentation for the `mock` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock).\n\nYou can use the [mockery tool](https://vektra.github.io/mockery/latest/) to autogenerate the mock code against an interface as well, making using mocks much quicker.\n\n[`suite`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite \"API documentation\") package\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> [!WARNING]\n> The suite package does not support parallel tests. See [#934](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/issues/934).\n\nThe `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object-oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with 'go test' as per normal.\n\nAn example suite is shown below:\n\n```go\n// Basic imports\nimport (\n    \"testing\"\n    \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n    \"github.com/stretchr/testify/suite\"\n)\n\n// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite\n// functionality from testify - including a T() method which\n// returns the current testing context\ntype ExampleTestSuite struct {\n    suite.Suite\n    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int\n}\n\n// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five\n// before each test\nfunc (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {\n    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5\n}\n\n// All methods that begin with \"Test\" are run as tests within a\n// suite.\nfunc (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {\n    assert.Equal(suite.T(), 5, suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive)\n}\n\n// In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create\n// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run\nfunc TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {\n    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))\n}\n```\n\nFor a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)\n\nFor more information on writing suites, check out the [API documentation for the `suite` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite).\n\n`Suite` object has assertion methods:\n\n```go\n// Basic imports\nimport (\n    \"testing\"\n    \"github.com/stretchr/testify/suite\"\n)\n\n// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite\n// functionality from testify - including assertion methods.\ntype ExampleTestSuite struct {\n    suite.Suite\n    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int\n}\n\n// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five\n// before each test\nfunc (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {\n    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5\n}\n\n// All methods that begin with \"Test\" are run as tests within a\n// suite.\nfunc (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {\n    suite.Equal(suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)\n}\n\n// In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create\n// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run\nfunc TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {\n    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))\n}\n```\n\n------\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install Testify, use `go get`:\n\n    go get github.com/stretchr/testify\n\nThis will then make the following packages available to you:\n\n    github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\n    github.com/stretchr/testify/require\n    github.com/stretchr/testify/mock\n    github.com/stretchr/testify/suite\n    github.com/stretchr/testify/http (deprecated)\n\nImport the `testify/assert` package into your code using this template:\n\n```go\npackage yours\n\nimport (\n  \"testing\"\n  \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n)\n\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n\n  assert.True(t, true, \"True is true!\")\n\n}\n```\n\n------\n\nStaying up to date\n==================\n\nTo update Testify to the latest version, use `go get -u github.com/stretchr/testify`.\n\n------\n\nSupported go versions\n==================\n\nWe currently support the most recent major Go versions from 1.19 onward.\n\n------\n\nContributing\n============\n\nPlease feel free to submit issues, fork the repository and send pull requests!\n\nWhen submitting an issue, we ask that you please include a complete test function that demonstrates the issue. Extra credit for those using Testify to write the test code that demonstrates it.\n\nCode generation is used.
