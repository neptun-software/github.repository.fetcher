Examples of representing our community include using an\nofficial e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,\nor acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline\nevent.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior\nmay be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement\nat [info@tailscale.com](mailto:info@tailscale.com). All complaints\nwill be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and\nsecurity of the reporter of any incident.\n\n## Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in\ndetermining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of\nthis Code of Conduct:\n\n### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior\ndeemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders,\nproviding clarity around the nature of the violation and an\nexplanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology\nmay be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series\nof actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued\nbehavior. No interaction with the people involved, including\nunsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for\na specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in\ncommunity spaces as well as external channels like social\nmedia. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards,\nincluding sustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or\npublic communication with the community for a specified period of\ntime. No public or private interaction with the people involved,\nincluding unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of\nConduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead\nto a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of\ncommunity standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,\nharassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of\nclasses of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction\nwithin the community.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor\nCovenant][homepage], version 2.0, available at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of\nconduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the\nFAQ at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

The `tailscaled` daemon runs on Linux, Windows,\n[macOS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants/), and to varying degrees\non FreeBSD and OpenBSD. The Tailscale iOS and Android apps use this repo's\ncode, but this repo doesn't contain the mobile GUI code.\n\nOther [Tailscale repos](https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/repositories) of note:\n\n* the Android app is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android\n* the Synology package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-synology\n* the QNAP package is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-qpkg\n* the Chocolatey packaging is at https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-chocolatey\n\nFor background on which parts of Tailscale are open source and why,\nsee [https://tailscale.com/opensource/](https://tailscale.com/opensource/).\n\n## Using\n\nWe serve packages for a variety of distros and platforms at\n[https://pkgs.tailscale.com](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/).\n\n## Other clients\n\nThe [macOS, iOS, and Windows clients](https://tailscale.com/download)\nuse the code in this repository but additionally include small GUI\nwrappers. The GUI wrappers on non-open source platforms are themselves\nnot open source.\n\n## Building\n\nWe always require the latest Go release, currently Go 1.23. (While we build\nreleases with our [Go fork](https://github.com/tailscale/go/), its use is not\nrequired.)\n\n```\ngo install tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale{,d}\n```\n\nIf you're packaging Tailscale for distribution, use `build_dist.sh`\ninstead, to burn commit IDs and version info into the binaries:\n\n```\n./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscale\n./build_dist.sh tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled\n```\n\nIf your distro has conventions that preclude the use of\n`build_dist.sh`, please do the equivalent of what it does in your\ndistro's way, so that bug reports contain useful version information.\n\n## Bugs\n\nPlease file any issues about this code or the hosted service on\n[the issue tracker](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPRs welcome! But please file bugs. Commit messages should [reference\nbugs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls).\n\nWe require [Developer Certificate of\nOrigin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)\n`Signed-off-by` lines in commits.\n\nSee `git log` for our commit message style. It's basically the same as\n[Go's style](https://go.dev/wiki/CommitMessage).\n\n## About Us\n\n[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is primarily developed by the\npeople at https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/people. For other contributors,\nsee:\n\n* https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/graphs/contributors\n* https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android/graphs/contributors\n\n## Legal\n\nWireGuard is a registered trademark of Jason A.
