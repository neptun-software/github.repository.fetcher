Specifically, the\n`kustomize build` command [appears in kubectl] as `kubectl kustomize`.\n\nThe code in the `build` package is dominated by flag validation,\nwith minimal business logic.  The critical lines are something\nlike\n\n```\n# Make a kustomizer.\nk := krusty.MakeKustomizer(\n  HonorKustomizeFlags(krusty.MakeDefaultOptions()),\n)\n\n# Run the kustomizer, sending location of kustomization.yaml\nm := k.Run(fSys, \"/path/to/dir\")\n\n# Write the result as YAML.\nwriter.Write(m.AsYaml())\n```\n\nThe `krusty` package is in the [`api`] module.\n\n### `api`\n\n> _Depends on [`kyaml`] and code generated from builtin plugin modules_\n\nThe [`api` module] is used by CLI programs like `kustomize` and `kubectl`\nto read and honor `kustomization.yaml` files and all that implies.\n\nThe main public packages in the [`api` module] are\n\n | package   |             |\n | --------: | :---------- |\n | `filters` | Implementations of [`kyaml/kio.Filter`] used by kustomize to transform Kubernetes objects. |\n |  `konfig` | Configuration methods and constants in the kustomize API. |\n |  `krusty` | Primary API entry point.  Holds the kustomizer and hundreds of tests for it. |\n |  `loader` | Loads kustomization files and the files they refer to, enforcing security rules. |\n |  `resmap` | The primary internal data structure over which the kustomizer and filters work. |\n |   `types` | The `Kustomization` object and ancillary structs. |\n\n### `cmd/config`\n\n> _Depends on [`kyaml`]_\n\nThis module contains cobra commands and kyaml-based functionality to\nprovide unix-like file manipulation commands to kustomize like `grep`\nand `tree`.  These commands may be included in any program that\nmanipulates k8s YAML (e.g. kustomize).\n\n### `kyaml`\n\n> _Has no in-repo dependence_\n\nThe [`kyaml` module] is a kubernetes-focussed enhancement of [go-yaml].\n\nThe YAML manipulation performed by a kustomize is based on these libraries.\n\nThese libraries evolve independently of kustomize, and other programs depend on them.\n\nThe key public packages in the [`kyaml` module] include\n\n | package   |             |\n | --------: | :---------- |\n | `errors` | Wrapper for the go-errors/errors lib |\n | `filesys` | A kustomize-specific file system abstraction, to ease writing tests |\n | `fn/framework` | An SDK for writing KRM Functions in Go |\n | `fn/runtime` | Implements the runtime for KRM Function extensions |\n | `kio` | Libraries for reading and writing collections of Kubernetes resources as RNodes |\n | `openapi` | Loads and accesses openapi schemas for schema-aware resource manipultaion |\n | `resid` | Representations to aid in unique identification of Kubernetes resources |\n | `yaml` | A Kubernetes-focused wrapper of [go-yaml], notably including the RNode object |\n\n\n-------\n\n## How _kustomize build_ works\n\nThe command `kustomize build` accepts a single string argument,\nwhich must resolve to a directory, possibly in a git repository,\ncalled the _kustomization root_.\n\nThis directory must contain a file called `kustomization.yaml`, with\nYAML that marshals into a single instance of a `Kustomization` object.\n\nFor the remainder of this document, the word _kustomization_ refers to\neither of these things.\n\nThis kustomization is the access point to a directed, acyclic graph of\nKubernetes objects, including other kustomizations, to include in a\nbuild.\n\nExecution of `build` starts and ends in the [`api`] module,\nfrequently dipping into the [`kyaml`] module for lower level\nYAML manipulation.\n\n### The `build` flow\n\n  - Validate command lines arguments and flags.\n\n  - Make a `Kustomizer` as a function of those arguments.\n\n  - Call `Run` on the kustomizer, passing it the path to the\n    kustomization.\n\n    `Run` returns an instance of `ResMap`, the `api` package's\n    representation of a set of kubernetes `Resource` objects.\n\n    This structure offers resource lookup methods (map behavior),\n    but also retains the resources in the order they were\n    specified in kustomization files (list behavior).\n\n    Post-run, the objects are fully hydrated, per the\n    instructions in the kustomization.\n\n  - Marshal the objects as YAML to a file or `stdout`.\n\n\n### The `Run` function\n\n  - Create various objects\n\n    - A `ResMap` factory.\n\n      Makes  `ResMaps` from byte streams, other `ResMaps`, etc.\n\n    - A file `loader.Loader`.\n\n      It's fed an appropriate set of restrictions, and the path to the kustomization.\n\n    - A plugin loader.\n\n      It finds plugins (transformers, generators or validators)\n      and prepares them for running.\n\n    - A `KustTarget` encapsulating all of the above.\n\n      A KustTarget contains one `Kustomization` and represents\n\t  everything that kustomization can reach.  This will include\n\t  other `KustTarget` instances, each having a smaller purview than\n\t  the one referencing it.\n\n  - Call `KustTarget.Load` to load its kustomization.\n\n    This step deals with deprecations and field changes.\n\n  - Load [openapi] data specified by the kustomization.\n\n    This is needed to recognize k8s kinds and their special\n    properties, e.g. which kinds are cluster-scoped, which kinds\n    refer to others, etc.\n\n  - Call `KustTarget.makeCustomizedResmap` to create the `ResMap` result.\n\n    This visits everything referenced by the kustomization,\n    performing all generation, transformation and validation.\n\n  - Finish the `Run` with\n\n    - Optional reordering of objects in `ResMap`, overriding the\n      FIFO rule.\n\n    - Optional addition of _kustomize build annotations_ to the\n      resources.  E.g. from which repo and file the resource was\n      read, the fact that kustomize touched the resource, etc.\n      These kustomize-specific annotations are intended for\n      server-side data analytics, file structure traceability and\n      reconstruction, etc.\n\n### The `makeCustomizedResmap` function\n\n  This function starts the process of object transformation,\n  as well as accumulation of recursively referenced data.\n\n  - Call `ra := KustTarget.AccumulateTarget`.\n\n    The result, `ra`, is a resource accumulator that contains\n    everything referred to by the current kustomization, now fully\n    hydrated.\n\n  - Uniquify names of generated objects by appending content hashes.\n\n    This cannot be done until the objects are complete.\n\n  - Fix all name references (given that names may have changed).\n\n    E.g. if a ConfigMaps was given a generated name, all objects that\n    refer to that ConfigMap must be given its name.\n\n  - Resolve vars, replacing them with whatever they refer to (a legacy feature).\n\n### The `AccumulateTarget` function\n\n  - Call `AccumulateResources` over the `resources` field (this can recurse).\n  - Call `AccumulateComponents` over the `components` field (this can recurse),\n  - Load legacy (pre-plugin) global kustomize configuration,\n  - Load legacy (pre-openapi) _Custom Resource Definition_ data.\n  - In the context of the data loaded above, run the kustomization's\n    - generators,\n    - transformers,\n    - and validators.\n  - Accumulate `vars` (make note of them for later replacement).\n\n### `AccumulateResources` and component accumulation\n\n  - If the path is a file:\n    - Accumulate the objects in the file (treating them\n      as opaque kubernetes objects).\n\n  - If the path is a directory:\n    - Create a new `KustTarget` referring to that directory's kustomization.\n\t- Call `subRa := KustTarget.AccumulateTarget`.\n    - Call `ra.MergeAccumulator(subRa)`\n\tThis completes a recursion.\n\n  - If the path is a git URL:\n    - Clone the repository to a temporary directory.\n    - Process the path optionally specified in the URL\n      as a path in the clone.\n\t- If no path specified, work from the repository root.\n\n\nThat's as deep as this discussion will go.\n\nThe deeper this document goes into the details, the faster\nit will get out of date.\n"

We are excited about the prospect of you joining our [community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community)! The Kubernetes community abides by the [CNCF Code of Conduct]. Here is an excerpt:\n\n_As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Forking Kustomize and Working Locally\nThe Kustomize project uses a \"Fork and Pull\" workflow that is standard to GitHub. In git terms, your personal fork is referred to as the \"origin\" and the actual project's git repository is called \"upstream\". To keep your personal branch (origin) up to date with the project (upstream), it must be configured within your local working copy.\n\n### Create a fork in GitHub\n1. Visit https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize\n2. Click the `Fork` button on the top right\n\n### Clone the repository\n```bash\n# Clone your repository fork from the previous step\ngit clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:<your github username>/kustomize.git\ncd kustomize\n\n# Configure upstream\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize\ngit remote set-url --push upstream no_push\n\n# Review git configuration\ngit remote -v\n```\n\n### Create a working branch\n```bash\n# Fetch changes from upstream master\ncd kustomize\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout master\ngit rebase upstream/master\n\n# Create your working branch\ngit checkout -b myfeature\n```\n\n### Sync your working branch\nYou will need to periodically fetch changes from the `upstream` repository to keep your working branch in sync.\n```bash\ncd kustomize\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout myfeature\ngit rebase upstream/master\n```\n\n### Push to GitHub\nWhen your changes are ready for review, push your working branch to your fork on GitHub.\n```bash\ncd kustomize\ngit push origin myfeature\n```\n\n### Pull Request Rules\n\nWe are using [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as the main guideline of making PR. This guideline serves to help contributor and maintainer to classify their changes, thus providing better insight on type of release will be covered on each Kustomize release cycle.\n\n1. Please add these keywords on your PR titles accordingly\n\n| Keyword  | Description | Example |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| fix  | Patching or fixing bugs or improvements introduction from previous release. This type of change will mark a `PATCH` release.  | fix: fix null value when generating yaml |\n| feat  | New features. This change will mark a `MINOR` release. | feat: new transformer and generator for ACME API CRD. |\n| chore  | Minor improvement outside main code base  | chore: add exclusion for transformer test. |\n| ci | CI/CD related changes (e.g. github workflow, scripts, CI steps). | ci: remove blocking tests |\n| docs  | Changes related to documentation. | docs: add rules documentation for PR. |\n\n\n2. Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` on your commit message as footer to signify breaking changes. This will help maintainers identify `MAJOR` releases.\n  \nExample:\n\n```\nfeat: change YAML parser from `yaml/v1` to `yaml/v2`\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: parse() function now works with 2 arguments.\n```\n\n### Create a Pull Request\n\n1. Visit your fork at `https://github.com/<user>/kustomize`\n2. Click the **Compare & Pull Request** button next to your `myfeature` branch.\n3. Check out the pull request [process](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md) for more details and advice.\n\nIf you ran `git push` in the previous step, GitHub will return a useful link to create a Pull Request.\n\n### Build Kustomize\nThe [Kustomize Architecture] document describes the respository organization and the kustomize build process.\n```bash\n# For go version >= 1.13\nunset GOPATH\nunset GO111MODULES\n\n# Build kustomize binary and install in go bin path\ncd kustomize\nmake kustomize\n\n# Run unit tests\nmake test-unit-all\n\n# Run linter\nmake lint\n\n# Test examples against HEAD\nmake test-examples-kustomize-against-HEAD\n\n# Run your development version\n~/go/bin/kustomize version\n```\n\n### General resources for contributors\n\n- [Contributor License Agreement] - Kubernetes projects require that you sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before we can accept your pull requests.\n- [Kubernetes Contributor Guide] - Main contributor documentation.\n- [Contributor Cheat Sheet] - Common resources for existing developers.\n\nHere are some additional ideas to help you get started with Kustomize:\n- Attend a Kustomize Bug Scrub. Check the [SIG-CLI] meetings list to find the next one.\n- Help triage issues by confirming validity and applying the appropriate `kind` label (e.g. comment `/kind bug`).\n- Pick up an issue to fix. Issues with the `help-wanted` label are a good place to start, but you can also look for any issue with the `triage/accepted` label and no assignee. Remember to `/assign` yourself to let others know you're working on it.\n- Help confirm new issues labelled `kind/bug` by reproducing them with the latest release.\n- Support Kustomize users by responding to questions on issues labelled `kind/support` or in the [Slack channel].\n\n## Mentorship\n\n- [Mentoring Initiatives](https://git.k8s.io/community/mentoring) - We have a diverse set of mentorship programs available that are always looking for volunteers!\n\n## Contributor Ladder\n\nKustomize follows the [Kubernetes Community Membership] contributor ladder. Roles are as follows:\n\n1. Contributor: Anyone who actively contributes code, issues or reviews to the project. All contributors must sign the [Contributor License Agreement].\n1. Reviewer: Contributors with a history of review and authorship on Kustomize. Has LGTM rights on the Kustomize repo (as do all kubernetes-sigs org members). Active contributors are encouraged to join the reviewers list to be automatically pinged on PRs.\n1. Approver: Highly experienced active reviewer and contributor to Kustomize. Has both LTGM and approval rights on the Kustomize repo, as well as \"maintain\" [Github permissions].\n1. Owner: Approver who sets technical direction and makes or approves design decisions for the project. Has LGTM and approval rights on the Kustomize repo as well as \"admin\" [Github permissions].\n\nThe kyaml module within the Kustomize repo has additional owners following the same ladder.\n\nFor the kustomize project, we have defined some specific guidelines on each step of the ladder:\n\nTo reach reviewer status, you must:\n- Have been actively involved in kustomize for 3+ months\n- Review at least 8 PRs that have been driven through to completion (see the reviewer guide below)\n- Author at least 5 PRs that have been approved and merged\n- Be a member of the kubernetes-sigs org. This should not be a blocker though, as once you meet the requirements for reviewer here,\nthe existing kustomize maintainers will be happy to sponsor your request to join the kubernetes-sigs org.\n- Once you have met the above requirements, you may submit a PR adding yourself to the kustomize reviewers list, with links to your\ncontributions in the description.\n\nTo reach approver status, you must:\n- Meet all the requirements of a reviewer\n- Have been actively involved in kustomize for 6+ months\n- Review at least 15 PRs that have been driven through to completion (see the reviewer guide below)\n- Authored PRs meeting *either* of the following requirements:\n  - 15 PRs that have been approved and merged\n  - *OR* 10 PRs that have been approved and merged where some were more difficult, required greater thought/design,\nor built up to larger features/long-term goals.\n- File 3 issues. This can be any number of things, including but not limited to:\n  - Bugs with kustomize usage that you've found\n  - CI or release improvements\n  - Creating subtasks of a larger feature or project that you are in charge of.\n  - Long term improvements for the health of the project\n- Triage at least 10 untriaged issues, including at least 1 feature request. The kustomize bug scrub is a great place to get practice with doing this, but you can\nalso follow the triage guide below to get started on your own.\n- Demonstrate deeper understanding of kustomize goals. This can take many forms and is a bit subjective, but here are a few examples:\n  - saying no to an eschewed feature, instead recommending an alternative solution that is more aligned with the declarative configuration model\n  - active participation in discussion on a feature request issue\n  - filing an issue describing a long term problem and solution aligned with kustomize goals, for example: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/5140\n  - writing up KEPs for features that will improve the kustomize workflow while being aligned with kustomize goals, for example: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/pull/4558\n- Regularly interact with the existing kustomize maintainers, with clear communication about what you are working on or planning to work on. The kustomize\nmaintainers should know who you are and be familiar with your contributions.\n- If you meet *most* of the above requirements while going above and beyond in a few areas, we will still consider your request to become an approver even\nif you are missing one or two of the requirements. Please contact the maintainers directly to ask about getting approver status if you fall into this category.\n- Otherwise, once you meet all the above requirements, you may:\n  - request to be added to the kustomize maintainer meeting that occurs each week with the kustomize PMs.\n  - submit a PR adding yourself to the kustomize approvers list, with links to your contributions in the description.\n\nTo reach owner status, you must:\n- Meet all the requirements of an approver\n- Have been actively involved with kustomize for 1+ year\n- Assisted the current owner in driving the roadmap. This can be explicit or implicit help, such as:\n  - Editing the roadmap directly\n  - Reviewing the roadmap\n  - Providing suggestions for issues or prioritization in meetings that indirectly influence the roadmap\n- Regularly triage issues and attend the kustomize bug scrub\n- Regularly review PRs (1-2 a week)\n- Periodically lead the kustomize bug scrub\n- Periodically release kustomize (ensuring that there are no release blockers and that release notes are clean)\n- Be the primary owner or point of contact for a particular project or area of code\n- Ideally, there should be 2-3 owners at a time. Reach out to the current owners if you are interested in ownership. These\nrequirements are not strict and evaluation is somewhat subjective.\n\n## Reviewer guide\nPlease watch this talk on how to review code from Tim Hockin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZVv7-o8i40\n\nFor reviewing PRs in kustomize, we have some specific guidelines:\n- If the PR is introducing a new feature:\n  - *It must be implementing an issue that has already been triage/accepted or\na KEP that has been approved.* If it is not, then request the PR author to first file an issue.\n  - The PR must include thorough tests for the new feature, including unit and integration tests\n  - The code must be clean and readable, with thought given to how we will maintain the code in the future\n  - If the feature requires being broken up into multiple PRs to ease review, the feature should not be exposed to users\n    until the feature is completed in the last PR. For example, while we were building `kustomize localize`, we\n    built the feature almost entirely under the `api` module as a library with all the needed tests. There was no way\n    for users to invoke the localize code until the last PR that actually exposed the `kustomize localize` command in the\n    kustomize binary. This allowed us to continue development of `kustomize localize` without blocking kustomize releases.\n    If this type of development is not possible, then new features requiring multiple PRs should be\n    developed in their own feature branch.\n- If the PR is introducing a bug fix:\n  - If the PR is not fixing an issue that has already been triage/accepted, follow the triage guide below on bug\n    fixes to decide if this is a PR we want to accept.\n  - The PR should have two distinct commits:\n    - The first commit should add a test demonstrating incorrect behavior\n    - The second commit should include the bug fix\n    - Some sample PRs:\n      - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/pull/5263/commits\n      - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/pull/3931/commits\n    - The regression test is absolutely required, and we cannot accept bug fixes without tests.\n- If the PR is introducing a performance improvement:\n  - The PR description should give an indication of how much the performance is being improved and how we\n    can measure it - benchmark tests are fantastic.\n- Other PRs (documentation, CI improvements, etc.) should be reviewed based on your best judgment.\n\n## Triage guide\nThe possible triage labels are listed here: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/labels?q=triage.\n\nTriaging a feature request means:\n- Understand what the user is asking for, and their use case.\n- Verify that it is not an [eschewed feature](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/faq/kustomize/eschewedfeatures/#build-time-side-effects-from-cli-args-or-env-variables)\n- Verify that it is not a duplicate issue.\n- Look into workarounds. Is there another way that the user can achieve their use case with existing features?\n- If you are new to this role, prior to leaving a comment on the issue, please bring it to weekly standup\nfor group discussion to make sure that we are all on the same page.\n- Once you feel ready, you can label it with a triage label. Here's an [example](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/5049). You can also\nlook at other feature request issues to see how they were triaged and resolved. There are a few different triage labels that you can use, you can see the\nfull list [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/labels?q=triage).\n\nTriaging a bug means:\n- First, verify that you can reproduce the issue. If you cannot reproduce the issue or need more information to give\nit a go, triage it accordingly.\n- Try to understand if this is really a bug or if this is intended behavior from kustomize. If it seems like intended\nbehavior, do your best to explain to the user why this is the case.\n- If it seems to be a genuine bug, you can /triage accept the issue. In addition, investigate if there are workarounds or\nalternative solutions for the user that they can try until the issue gets resolved.\n\nThe triage party for kustomize is here https://cli.triage.k8s.io/s/kustomize and can be a easy way to\nfind issues that have not been triaged yet.\n\n## Project/Product Managers\n\nKustomize will have opportunities to join in a project/product manager role. You can reach out to\nthe existing kustomize maintainers if you are interested in this type of role. Project management work\ncan greatly help supplement your contributions as you climb from reviewer to approver\nto owner.\n\nExpectations for this role are:\n\n- Triage 1 feature request each week, and bring it to weekly stand-up for discussion. Feature\nrequests are issues labeled kind/feature, and you can find them [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+kind+feature+label%3Akind%2Ffeature).\nPlease view the above triage guide for details on how to approach feature request triage.\n- Monitor the kustomize Slack channel and try to help users if you can. It is a pretty\nactive channel, so responding to 4-5 users per week is sufficient even if some\nquestions go unanswered. If there is an interesting topic or a recurring problem that many\nusers are having, please bring it up in weekly stand-up.\n- Keeping track of a queue of backlog issues or PRs that are not being actively looked at in any existing project board.\n- Organizing or reorganizing project tracking boards when it makes sense.\n\nYou will also be asked to help with roadmap planning, deprecation communication, prioritization,\nand doing research on kustomize usage when appropriate, though these responsibilities will occur less\nfrequently.\n\n## Administrative notes:\n\n- The [OWNERS file spec] is a useful resources in making changes.\n- Maintainers and admins must be added to the appropriate lists in both [Kustomize OWNERS_ALIASES] and [SIG-CLI Teams]. If this isn't done, the individual in question will lack either PR approval rights (Kustomize list) or the appropriate Github repository permissions (community list).\n\n## Contact Information\n\n- [Slack channel]\n- [Mailing list]\n"

Take this roadmap as more of what we hope to achieve\nrather than what we promise to achieve, as some items in this doc are highly dependent\non the success that we have on-ramping new contributors to the project, and other\nitems will depend on external contributions, which can vary.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to a particular area, you can look through\nthe project board for that area and assign yourself to one of the issues. It is\nrecommended to start with smaller issues to ramp up on the project before starting\nto tackle larger issues.\n\nProject boards:\nhttps://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/50\nhttps://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/51\nhttps://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/52\nhttps://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/53\nhttps://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/54\n\n## Kustomize contributors (at time of writing):\n\nkustomize owner: @natasha41575\n\nkustomize maintainers: @annasong20, @koba1t\n\nkustomize contributors: @varshaprasad96\n\n\n# H2 2023\n\n## Goal: Create kustomize leadership and contributor playbooks\n\nContributors: natasha41575, annasong20\n\nPriority: High\n\nEffort: Medium\n\nIn the past, when the leads stopped contributing (for various reasons, not covered here)\nin various kubernetes projects, it left a wide hole that few could easily fill,\nleaving the remaining leads in a bad position and the project understaffed. We should assume\nthat we will need to onboard new maintainers in the future, and should have playbooks\nfor doing so. As we grow the contributor base in kustomize, we will build these playbooks for\nthose who are contributing and those who are looking to grow into kustomize leaders.\nTo ensure the long term health and stability of the project, we should have:\n\n- On-boarding guides for new contributors\n- Clear guidelines for how to climb the kustomize ladder from contributor to approver to owner\n- A plan (maybe a schedule) for future kustomize cohorts\n- A succession plan, in case the current kustomize leads ever decide to step down\n\n## Goal: Onboard 2-5 new contributors to kustomize\n\nContributors: natasha41575, annasong20, koba1t\n\nPriority: High\n\nEffort: High\n\nIn order to make progress on kustomize goals in the future, we need to increase the\nlevel of staffing on kustomize. We should leverage community contributions to keep kustomize\nhealthy and making progress.\n\nThe primary means in which we will try to find new kustomize contributors is through the new kustomize\nmaintainer training cohort. We will lead a group of ~20 kubernetes community members through a 3-6 month\ntraining program, involving talk sessions, bug scrubs, issue triage, PR reviews, and coding projects for\neach member.\n\nSee [our call for help](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/M5OphEVsv5o/m/zc6G4H15AAAJ) for more\nspecific details about the program.\n\nThe effort from existing kustomize maintainers here will be to:\n- Organize the cohort, so that each cohort member feels productive and understands what they should work on\n- Align motivation of the cohort members with the work that we assign to them.\n- Review PRs from cohort members in a timely manner.\n- Be the point(s) of contact for questions/escalations\n- Lead weekly stand-ups and monthly bug scrubs\n\nAt the end of all this, if we have a small team of contributors to kustomize, who understand its founding\nphilosophy and intentions, we should be able to keep the project up to date.\n\n## Goal: Improve kustomize extensibility through KRM functions and CRD support\n\nContributors: koba1t, varshaprasad96, external contributors\n\nPriority: High\n\nEffort: High\n\nProject board: https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/53/views/1\n\nFor a long time, we have supported KRM functions as the proper way to implement custom generators and transformers.\nHowever, due to limited staffing, we have been unable to drive this feature out of alpha in kustomize. The two\nmain features which we hope to make progress on are Composition and Catalog, two long-standing proposals for which\nnumerous users have been waiting for a long time. There are several open issues\nregarding KRM functions where our long-term answer has been these two features, but users have been hearing about them\nfor over a year without seeing any progress. If we can implement them, they will vastly improve usability and security\nof KRM functions.\n\nOne item that falls under this category that does not currently have a contributor is improving CRD support.\nCurrently, it is difficult to use CRDs properly, as there are three different fields (configurations, openapi, and crds)\nwhere users have to input their CRD configuration. We need to consolidate these fields into one easy to use feature to\nsupport CRDs. If you are interested in putting together a design proposal for how to tackle this task, please reach\nout to the kustomize maintainers.\n\n# H1 2024\n\n## Goal: Improve the kustomize documentation\n\nContributors: annasong20, external contributions\n\nPriority: High\n\nEffort: High\n\nProject board: https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/50\n\nThe kustomize documentation is currently fragmented, out of date, and lacks examples to fully understand its value.\nWe have had a \"docs project\" for a long time; we need to prioritize implementing it so that the documentation is in\none place, easy to find, and helps new users get started more easily. Some outcomes from this project should be:\n\n- A single, unified website hosted on kustomize.io\n- Updated information architecture, and a plan to keep it up to date\n- End to end examples of using kustomize, including complex use cases\n\n## Goal: Fix core usability bugs in kustomize\n\nContributors: external contributions\n\nPriority: High\n\nEffort: High\n\nProject board: https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/51\n\nThere are several core usability issues that block some users from adopting kustomize features or in\nsome base block users from using kustomize entirely. These issues range from small bugs with workable but\ninconvenient workarounds, to enormous feature gaps.\n\nAs part of this goal, we should work toward reducing the number of such issues that we have, making\nkustomize work more smoothly and predictably, and be usable for a larger range of users.\n\nThere are a lot of important issues in this project, but the biggest and highest priority one is that\nkustomize doesn't currently support metadata.GenerateName. Unfortunately, we don't currently have anyone\nactively working on this issue, we would need an external contributor to reach out to the kustomize\nmaintainers to pick it up.\n\n## Goal: Improve kustomize CI, release, & security patch processes\n\nContributors: external contributions\n\nPriority: Medium\n\nEffort: High\n\nProject board: https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/54\n\nThe kustomize release process is currently done on-demand and is strictly linear. This means that if we find a CVE,\nwe are forced to release the next version of kustomize ASAP, and we are required to release every PR that has merged\nsince the last release. This can put us in a sticky situation if we have a breaking change that we are\nnot ready to release yet, but we need a patch quickly.\n\nWe should try to improve the kustomize release process so that we can release frequently, reliably, and with some\nflexibility. The outcome of this effort should be:\n\n- kustomize is released on a regular cadence (biweekly or monthly)\n- kustomize is able to separate patch and feature releases, so that we can fix CVEs without needing to release\neverything that we have in flight\n- We can detect and fix CVEs early\n\n## Goal: Take long-standing alpha commands out of alpha\n\nContributors: external contributions\n\nPriority: Medium\n\nEffort: Medium\n\nProject board: https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes-sigs/projects/52\n\nThere are several commands in kustomize that have been alpha for a long time, including the cfg command group and\nlocalize. Moving them forward can indicate good health of a project and these commands are useful to many users.\nSome of these projects can be good starter issues for new contributors to have an easier onramp while others will\nrequire more effort and thought.\n"
