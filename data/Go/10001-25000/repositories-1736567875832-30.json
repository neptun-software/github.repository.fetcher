See synonyms at initialization https://www.gin-vue-admin.com/docs/first\n- Replace the Qiniuyun public key, private key, warehouse name and default url address in the project to avoid data confusion in the test file.\n```\n\n### 2.1 server project\n\nuse `Goland` And other editing tools，open server catalogue，You can't open it. `gin-vue-admin` root directory\n\n```bash\n# clone the project\ngit clone https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin.git\n\n# open server catalogue\ncd server\n\n# use go mod And install the go dependency package\ngo generate\n\n# Compile \ngo build -o server main.go (windows the compile command is go build -o server.exe main.go )\n\n# Run binary\n./server (windows The run command is server.exe)\n```\n\n### 2.1 web project\n\n```bash\n# enter the project directory\ncd web\n\n# install dependency\nnpm install\n\n# develop\nnpm run serve\n```\n\n### 2.2 Server\n\n```bash\n# using go.mod\n\n# install go modules\ngo list (go mod tidy)\n\n# build the server\ngo build\n```\n\n### 2.3 API docs auto-generation using swagger\n\n#### 2.3.1 install swagger \n\n##### (1) Using VPN or outside mainland China\n````\ngo get -u github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag\n````\n\n##### (2) In mainland China\n\nIn mainland China, access to go.org/x is prohibited，we recommend [goproxy.io](https://goproxy.io/zh/) or [goproxy.cn](https://goproxy.cn)\n\n````bash\n# If you are using a version of Go 1.13 - 1.15 Need to set up manually GO111MODULE=on, The opening mode is as follows, If your Go version is 1.16 ~ Latest edition You can ignore the following step one\n# Step one、Enable Go Modules Function\ngo env -w GO111MODULE=on \n# Step two、Configuration GOPROXY Environment variable\ngo env -w GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,https://goproxy.io,direct\n\n# If you dislike trouble,You can use the go generate Automatically execute code before compilation, But this can't be used command line terminal of `Goland` or `Vscode` \ncd server\ngo generate -run \"go env -w .*?\"\n\n# 使用如下命令下载swag\ngo get -u github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag\n````\n\n#### 2.3.2 API docs generation\n\n````\ncd server\nswag init\n````\n\n> After executing the above command，server directory will appear in the docs folder `docs.go`, `swagger.json`, `swagger.yaml` Three file updates，After starting the go service, type in the browser [http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html) You can view swagger document\n\n\n## 3. Technical selection\n\n- Frontend: using [Element](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element) based on [Vue](https://vuejs.org)，to code the page.\n- Backend: using [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) to quickly build basic RESTful API. [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/)is a web framework written in Go (Golang).\n- DB: `MySql`(5.6.44)，using [gorm](http://gorm.io)` to implement data manipulation, added support for SQLite databases.\n- Cache: using `Redis` to implement the recording of the JWT token of the currently active user and implement the multi-login restriction.\n- API: using Swagger to auto generate APIs docs。\n- Config: using [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) and [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) to implement `yaml` config file。\n- Log: using [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) record logs。\n\n## 4.

Features\n\n- Authority management: Authority management based on `jwt` and `casbin`. \n- File upload and download: implement file upload operations based on `Qiniuyun', `Aliyun 'and `Tencent Cloud` (please develop your own application for each platform corresponding to `token` or `key` ).\n- Pagination Encapsulation：The frontend uses `mixins` to encapsulate paging, and the paging method can call `mixins` .\n- User management: The system administrator assigns user roles and role permissions.\n- Role management: Create the main object of permission control, and then assign different API permissions and menu permissions to the role.\n- Menu management: User dynamic menu configuration implementation, assigning different menus to different roles.\n- API management: Different users can call different API permissions.\n- Configuration management: the configuration file can be modified in the foreground (this feature is not available in the online experience site).\n- Conditional search: Add an example of conditional search.\n- Restful example: You can see sample APIs in user management module.\n  - Front-end file reference: [web/src/view/superAdmin/api/api.vue](https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/master/web/src/view/superAdmin/api/api.vue).\n  - Stage reference: [server/router/sys_api.go](https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/master/server/router/sys_api.go).\n- Multi-login restriction: Change `user-multipoint` to true in `system` in `config.yaml` (You need to configure redis and redis parameters yourself. During the test period, please report in time if there is a bug).\n- Upload file by chunk：Provides examples of file upload and large file upload by chunk.\n- Form Builder：With the help of [@form-generator](https://github.com/JakHuang/form-generator).\n- Code generator: Providing backend with basic logic and simple curd code generator.\n\n## 6.

Gin-vue-admin是一个基于 [vue](https://vuejs.org) 和 [gin](https://gin-gonic.com) 开发的全栈前后端分离的开发基础平台，集成jwt鉴权，动态路由，动态菜单，casbin鉴权，表单生成器，代码生成器等功能，提供多种示例文件，让您把更多时间专注在业务开发上。\n\n[在线预览](http://demo.gin-vue-admin.com): http://demo.gin-vue-admin.com\n\n测试用户名：admin\n\n测试密码：123456\n\n### 1.2 贡献指南\nHi! 首先感谢你使用 gin-vue-admin。\n\nGin-vue-admin 是一套为快速研发准备的一整套前后端分离架构式的开源框架，旨在快速搭建中小型项目。\n\nGin-vue-admin 的成长离不开大家的支持，如果你愿意为 gin-vue-admin 贡献代码或提供建议，请阅读以下内容。\n\n#### 1.2.1 Issue 规范\n- issue 仅用于提交 Bug 或 Feature 以及设计相关的内容，其它内容可能会被直接关闭。\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n- 在提交 issue 之前，请搜索相关内容是否已被提出。\n\n#### 1.2.2 Pull Request 规范\n- 请先 fork 一份到自己的项目下，不要直接在仓库下建分支。\n\n- commit 信息要以`[文件名]: 描述信息` 的形式填写，例如 `README.md: fix xxx bug`。\n\n- 如果是修复 bug，请在 PR 中给出描述信息。\n\n- 合并代码需要两名维护人员参与：一人进行 review 后 approve，另一人再次 review，通过后即可合并。\n\n## 2. 使用说明\n\n```\n- node版本 > v16.8.3\n- golang版本 >= v1.22\n- IDE推荐：Goland\n```\n\n### 2.1 server项目\n\n使用 `Goland` 等编辑工具，打开server目录，不可以打开 gin-vue-admin 根目录\n\n```bash\n\n# 克隆项目\ngit clone https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin.git\n# 进入server文件夹\ncd server\n\n# 使用 go mod 并安装go依赖包\ngo generate\n\n# 运行\ngo run . \n\n```\n\n### 2.2 web项目\n\n```bash\n# 进入web文件夹\ncd web\n\n# 安装依赖\nnpm install\n\n# 启动web项目\nnpm run serve\n```\n\n### 2.3 swagger自动化API文档\n\n#### 2.3.1 安装 swagger\n\n``` shell\ngo install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest\n```\n\n#### 2.3.2 生成API文档\n\n```` shell\ncd server\nswag init\n````\n\n> 执行上面的命令后，server目录下会出现docs文件夹里的 `docs.go`, `swagger.json`, `swagger.yaml` 三个文件更新，启动go服务之后, 在浏览器输入 [http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:8888/swagger/index.html) 即可查看swagger文档\n\n### 2.4 VSCode工作区\n\n#### 2.4.1 开发\n\n使用`VSCode`打开根目录下的工作区文件`gin-vue-admin.code-workspace`，在边栏可以看到三个虚拟目录：`backend`、`frontend`、`root`。\n\n#### 2.4.2 运行/调试\n\n在运行和调试中也可以看到三个task：`Backend`、`Frontend`、`Both (Backend & Frontend)`。运行`Both (Backend & Frontend)`可以同时启动前后端项目。\n\n#### 2.4.3 settings\n\n在工作区配置文件中有`go.toolsEnvVars`字段，是用于`VSCode`自身的go工具环境变量。此外在多go版本的系统中，可以通过`gopath`、`go.goroot`指定运行版本。\n\n```json\n    \"go.gopath\": null,\n    \"go.goroot\": null,\n```\n\n## 3. 技术选型\n\n- 前端：用基于 [Vue](https://vuejs.org) 的 [Element](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element) 构建基础页面。\n- 后端：用 [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) 快速搭建基础restful风格API，[Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) 是一个go语言编写的Web框架。\n- 数据库：采用`MySql` > (5.7) 版本 数据库引擎 InnoDB，使用 [gorm](http://gorm.cn) 实现对数据库的基本操作。\n- 缓存：使用`Redis`实现记录当前活跃用户的`jwt`令牌并实现多点登录限制。\n- API文档：使用`Swagger`构建自动化文档。\n- 配置文件：使用 [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) 和 [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) 实现`yaml`格式的配置文件。\n- 日志：使用 [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) 实现日志记录。\n\n## 4. 项目架构\n\n### 4.1

权限管理：基于`jwt`和`casbin`实现的权限管理。\n- 文件上传下载：实现基于`七牛云`, `阿里云`, `腾讯云` 的文件上传操作(请开发自己去各个平台的申请对应 `token` 或者对应`key`)。\n- 分页封装：前端使用 `mixins` 封装分页，分页方法调用 `mixins` 即可。\n- 用户管理：系统管理员分配用户角色和角色权限。\n- 角色管理：创建权限控制的主要对象，可以给角色分配不同api权限和菜单权限。\n- 菜单管理：实现用户动态菜单配置，实现不同角色不同菜单。\n- api管理：不同用户可调用的api接口的权限不同。\n- 配置管理：配置文件可前台修改(在线体验站点不开放此功能)。\n- 条件搜索：增加条件搜索示例。\n- restful示例：可以参考用户管理模块中的示例API。\n\t- 前端文件参考: [web/src/view/superAdmin/api/api.vue](https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/master/web/src/view/superAdmin/api/api.vue)\n    - 后台文件参考: [server/router/sys_api.go](https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/blob/master/server/router/sys_api.go)\n- 多点登录限制：需要在`config.yaml`中把`system`中的`use-multipoint`修改为true(需要自行配置Redis和Config中的Redis参数，测试阶段，有bug请及时反馈)。\n- 分片上传：提供文件分片上传和大文件分片上传功能示例。\n- 表单生成器：表单生成器借助 [@Variant Form](https://github.com/vform666/variant-form) 。\n- 代码生成器：后台基础逻辑以及简单curd的代码生成器。\n\n## 6. 知识库 \n\n## 6.1 团队博客\n\n>
