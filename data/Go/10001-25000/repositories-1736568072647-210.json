          "content": "# Contributing to JuiceFS\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Before starting work on a feature or bug fix, please search GitHub or reach out to us via GitHub, Slack etc. The purpose of this step is make sure no one else is already working on it and we'll ask you to open a GitHub issue if necessary.\n- We will use the GitHub issue to discuss the feature and come to agreement. This is to prevent your time being wasted, as well as ours.\n- If it is a major feature update, we highly recommend you also write a design document to help the community understand your motivation and solution.\n- A good way to find a project properly sized for a first time contributor is to search for open issues with the label [\"kind/good-first-issue\"](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/labels/kind%2Fgood-first-issue) or [\"kind/help-wanted\"](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/labels/kind%2Fhelp-wanted).\n\n## Coding Style\n\n- We're following [\"Effective Go\"](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and [\"Go Code Review Comments\"](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).\n- Use `go fmt` to format your code before committing. You can find information in editor support for Go tools in [\"IDEs and Plugins for Go\"](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins).\n- If you see any code which clearly violates the style guide, please fix it and send a pull request.\n- Every new source file must begin with a license header.\n- Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and use it to set up a pre-commit hook for static analysis. Just run `pre-commit install` in the root of the repo.\n\n## Sign the CLA\n\nBefore you can contribute to JuiceFS, you will need to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/juicedata/juicefs). There're a CLA assistant to guide you when you first time submit a pull request.\n\n## What is a Good PR\n\n- Presence of unit tests\n- Adherence to the coding style\n- Adequate in-line comments\n- Explanatory commit message\n\n## Contribution Flow\n\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\n\n1. Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. This is usually `main`.\n1. Make commits of logical units.\n1. Make sure commit messages are in the proper format.\n1. Push changes in a topic branch to a personal fork of the repository.\n1. Submit a pull request to [juicedata/juicefs](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/compare). The PR should link to one issue which either created by you or others.\n1. The PR must receive approval from at least one maintainer before it be merged.\n\nHappy hacking!\n"

The data, stored via JuiceFS, will be persisted in Object Storage _(e.g. Amazon S3)_, and the corresponding metadata can be persisted in various compatible database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and TiKV based on the scenarios and requirements.\n\nWith JuiceFS, massive cloud storage can be directly connected to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms in production environments. Without modifying code, the massive cloud storage can be used as efficiently as local storage.\n\n📖 **Document**: [Quick Start Guide](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/quick_start_guide)\n\n## Highlighted Features\n\n1. **Fully POSIX-compatible**: Use as a local file system, seamlessly docking with existing applications without breaking business workflow.\n2. **Fully Hadoop-compatible**: JuiceFS' [Hadoop Java SDK](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/hadoop_java_sdk) is compatible with Hadoop 2.x and Hadoop 3.x as well as a variety of components in the Hadoop ecosystems.\n3. **S3-compatible**:  JuiceFS' [S3 Gateway](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/s3_gateway) provides an S3-compatible interface.\n4. **Cloud Native**: A [Kubernetes CSI Driver](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/how_to_use_on_kubernetes) is provided for easily using JuiceFS in Kubernetes.\n5. **Shareable**: JuiceFS is a shared file storage that can be read and written by thousands of clients.\n6. **Strong Consistency**: The confirmed modification will be immediately visible on all the servers mounted with the same file system.\n7. **Outstanding Performance**: The latency can be as low as a few milliseconds, and the throughput can be expanded nearly unlimitedly _(depending on the size of the Object Storage)_. [Test results](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/benchmark)\n8. **Data Encryption**: Supports data encryption in transit and at rest (please refer to [the guide](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/security/encrypt) for more information).\n9. **Global File Locks**: JuiceFS supports both BSD locks (flock) and POSIX record locks (fcntl).\n10. **Data Compression**: JuiceFS supports [LZ4](https://lz4.github.io/lz4) or [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd) to compress all your data.\n\n---\n\n[Architecture](#architecture) | [Getting Started](#getting-started) | [Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) | [POSIX Compatibility](#posix-compatibility) | [Performance Benchmark](#performance-benchmark) | [Supported Object Storage](#supported-object-storage) | [Who is using](#who-is-using) | [Roadmap](#roadmap) | [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues) | [Contributing](#contributing) | [Community](#community) | [Usage Tracking](#usage-tracking) | [License](#license) | [Credits](#credits) | [FAQ](#faq)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture\n\nJuiceFS consists of three parts:\n\n1. **JuiceFS Client**: Coordinates Object Storage and metadata storage engine as well as implementation of file system interfaces such as POSIX, Hadoop, Kubernetes, and S3 gateway.\n2. **Data Storage**: Stores data, with supports of a variety of data storage media, e.g., local disk, public or private cloud Object Storage, and HDFS.\n3. **Metadata Engine**: Stores the corresponding metadata that contains information of file name, file size, permission group, creation and modification time and directory structure, etc., with supports of different metadata engines, e.g., Redis, MySQL, SQLite and TiKV.\n\n![JuiceFS Architecture](docs/en/images/juicefs-arch-new.png)\n\nJuiceFS can store the metadata of file system on different metadata engines, like Redis, which is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data storage, particularly suitable for storing metadata; meanwhile, all the data will be stored in Object Storage through JuiceFS client. [Learn more](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/architecture)\n\n![data-structure-diagram](docs/en/images/data-structure-diagram.svg)\n\nEach file stored in JuiceFS is split into **\"Chunk\"** s at a fixed size with the default upper limit of 64 MiB. Each Chunk is composed of one or more **\"Slice\"**(s), and the length of the slice varies depending on how the file is written. Each slice is composed of size-fixed **\"Block\"** s, which are 4 MiB by default. These blocks will be stored in Object Storage in the end; at the same time, the metadata information of the file and its Chunks, Slices, and Blocks will be stored in metadata engines via JuiceFS. [Learn more](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/architecture/#how-juicefs-store-files)\n\n![How JuiceFS stores your files](docs/en/images/how-juicefs-stores-files.svg)\n\nWhen using JuiceFS, files will eventually be split into Chunks, Slices and Blocks and stored in Object Storage. Therefore, the source files stored in JuiceFS cannot be found in the file browser of the Object Storage platform; instead, there are only a chunks directory and a bunch of digitally numbered directories and files in the bucket. Don't panic! This is just the secret of the high-performance operation of JuiceFS!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have:\n\n1. One supported metadata engine, see [How to Set Up Metadata Engine](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/databases_for_metadata)\n2. One supported Object Storage for storing data blocks, see [Supported Object Storage](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/how_to_setup_object_storage)\n3. [JuiceFS Client](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/installation) downloaded and installed\n\nPlease refer to [Quick Start Guide](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/quick_start_guide) to start using JuiceFS right away!\n\n### Command Reference\n\nCheck out all the command line options in [command reference](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/command_reference).\n\n### Containers\n\nJuiceFS can be used as a persistent volume for Docker and Podman, please check [here](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/juicefs_on_docker) for details.\n\n### Kubernetes\n\nIt is also very easy to use JuiceFS on Kubernetes. Please find more information [here](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/how_to_use_on_kubernetes).\n\n### Hadoop Java SDK\n\nIf you wanna use JuiceFS in Hadoop, check [Hadoop Java SDK](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/hadoop_java_sdk).\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n- [Redis Best Practices](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/redis_best_practices)\n- [How to Setup Object Storage](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/how_to_setup_object_storage)\n- [Cache](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/cache)\n- [Fault Diagnosis and Analysis](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/fault_diagnosis_and_analysis)\n- [FUSE Mount Options](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/fuse_mount_options)\n- [Using JuiceFS on Windows](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/installation#windows)\n- [S3 Gateway](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/s3_gateway)\n\nPlease refer to [JuiceFS Document Center](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/introduction) for more information.\n\n## POSIX Compatibility\n\nJuiceFS has passed all of the compatibility tests (8813 in total) in the latest [pjdfstest](https://github.com/pjd/pjdfstest) .\n\n```\nAll tests successful.\n\nTest Summary Report\n-------------------\n/root/soft/pjdfstest/tests/chown/00.t          (Wstat: 0 Tests: 1323 Failed: 0)\n  TODO passed:   693, 697, 708-709, 714-715, 729, 733\nFiles=235, Tests=8813, 233 wallclock secs ( 2.77 usr  0.38 sys +  2.57 cusr  3.93 csys =  9.65 CPU)\nResult: PASS\n```\n\nAside from the POSIX features covered by pjdfstest, JuiceFS also provides:\n\n- **Close-to-open consistency**. Once a file is written _and_ closed, it is guaranteed to view the written data in the following opens and reads from any client. Within the same mount point, all the written data can be read immediately.\n- Rename and all other metadata operations are atomic, which are guaranteed by supported metadata engine transaction.\n- Opened files remain accessible after unlink from same mount point.\n- Mmap (tested with FSx).\n- Fallocate with punch hole support.\n- Extended attributes (xattr).\n- BSD locks (flock).\n- POSIX record locks (fcntl).\n\n## Performance Benchmark\n\n### Basic benchmark\n\nJuiceFS provides a subcommand that can run a few basic benchmarks to help you understand how it works in your environment:\n\n![JuiceFS Bench](docs/en/images/juicefs-bench.png)\n\n### Throughput\n\nA sequential read/write benchmark has also been performed on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [fio](https://github.com/axboe/fio).\n\n![Sequential Read Write Benchmark](docs/en/images/sequential-read-write-benchmark.svg)\n\nAbove result figure shows that JuiceFS can provide 10X more throughput than the other two (see [more details](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/fio)).\n\n### Metadata IOPS\n\nA simple mdtest benchmark has been performed on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [mdtest](https://github.com/hpc/ior).\n\n![Metadata Benchmark](docs/en/images/metadata-benchmark.svg)\n\nThe result shows that JuiceFS can provide significantly more metadata IOPS than the other two (see [more details](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/mdtest)).\n\n### Analyze performance\n\nSee [Real-Time Performance Monitoring](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/fault_diagnosis_and_analysis#performance-monitor) if you encountered performance issues.\n\n## Supported Object Storage\n\n- Amazon S3 _(and other S3 compatible Object Storage services)_\n- Google Cloud Storage\n- Azure Blob Storage\n- Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS)\n- Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS)\n- Qiniu Cloud Object Storage (Kodo)\n- QingStor Object Storage\n- Ceph RGW\n- MinIO\n- Local disk\n- Redis\n- ...\n\nJuiceFS supports numerous Object Storage services. [Learn more](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/how_to_setup_object_storage#supported-object-storage).\n\n## Who is using\n\nJuiceFS is production ready and used by thousands of machines in production. A list of users has been assembled and documented [here](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/adopters). In addition JuiceFS has several collaborative projects that integrate with other open source projects, which we have documented [here](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/integrations). If you are also using JuiceFS, please feel free to let us know, and you are welcome to share your specific experience with everyone.\n\nThe storage format is stable, and will be supported by all future releases.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- User and group quotas\n- Snapshots\n- Write once read many (WORM)\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nWe use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/issues) to track community reported issues. You can also [contact](#community) the community for any questions.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for your contribution! Please refer to the [JuiceFS Contributing Guide](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/development/contributing_guide) for more information.\n\n## Community\n\nWelcome to join the [Discussions](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/discussions) and the [Slack channel](https://go.juicefs.com/slack) to connect with JuiceFS team members and other users.\n\n## Usage Tracking\n\nJuiceFS collects **anonymous** usage data by default to help us better understand how the community is using JuiceFS. Only core metrics (e.g. version number) will be reported, and user data and any other sensitive data will not be included. The related code can be viewed [here](pkg/usage/usage.go).\n\nYou could also disable reporting easily by command line option `--no-usage-report`:\n\n```bash\njuicefs mount --no-usage-report\n```\n\n## License\n\nJuiceFS is open-sourced under Apache License 2.0, see [LICENSE](LICENSE).\n\n## Credits\n\nThe design of JuiceFS was inspired by [Google File System](https://research.google/pubs/pub51), [HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org) and [MooseFS](https://moosefs.com). Thanks for their great work!\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why doesn't JuiceFS support XXX Object Storage?\n\nJuiceFS supports many Object Storage services. Please check out [this list](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/how_to_setup_object_storage#supported-object-storage) first. If the Object Storage you want to use is compatible with S3, you could treat it as S3. Otherwise, try reporting any issue.\n\n### Can I use Redis Cluster as metadata engine?\n\nYes. Since [v1.0.0 Beta3](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3) JuiceFS supports the use of [Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/docs/manual/scaling) as the metadata engine, but it should be noted that Redis Cluster requires that the keys of all operations in a transaction must be in the same hash slot, so a JuiceFS file system can only use one hash slot.\n\nSee [\"Redis Best Practices\"](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/redis_best_practices) for more information.\n\n### What's the difference between JuiceFS and XXX?\n\nSee [\"Comparison with Others\"](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/comparison/juicefs_vs_alluxio) for more information.\n\nFor more FAQs, please see the [full list](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/faq).\n\n## Stargazers over time\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=juicedata/juicefs&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#juicedata/juicefs&Date)\n"

[POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) 文件系统，针对云原生环境特别优化设计，在 Apache 2.0 开源协议下发布。使用 JuiceFS 存储数据，数据本身会被持久化在对象存储（例如 Amazon S3），而数据所对应的元数据可以根据场景需求被持久化在 Redis、MySQL、TiKV 等多种数据库引擎中。\n\nJuiceFS 可以简单便捷的将海量云存储直接接入已投入生产环境的大数据、机器学习、人工智能以及各种应用平台，无需修改代码即可像使用本地存储一样高效使用海量云端存储。\n\n📺 **视频**：[什么是 JuiceFS?](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HK4y197va)\n\n📖 **文档**：[快速上手指南](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/quick_start_guide)\n\n## 核心特性\n\n1. **POSIX 兼容**：像本地文件系统一样使用，无缝对接已有应用，无业务侵入性；\n2. **HDFS 兼容**：完整兼容 [HDFS API](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/hadoop_java_sdk)，提供更强的元数据性能；\n3. **S3 兼容**：提供 [S3 网关](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/s3_gateway) 实现 S3 协议兼容的访问接口；\n4. **云原生**：通过 [Kubernetes CSI 驱动](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/how_to_use_on_kubernetes) 可以很便捷地在 Kubernetes 中使用 JuiceFS；\n5. **多端共享**：同一文件系统可在上千台服务器同时挂载，高性能并发读写，共享数据；\n6. **强一致性**：确认的修改会在所有挂载了同一文件系统的服务器上立即可见，保证强一致性；\n7. **强悍性能**：毫秒级的延迟，近乎无限的吞吐量（取决于对象存储规模），查看[性能测试结果](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/benchmark)；\n8. **数据安全**：支持传输中加密（encryption in transit）以及静态加密（encryption at

POSIX、Hadoop、Kubernetes、S3 Gateway 等文件系统接口的实现；\n2. **数据存储**：存储数据本身，支持本地磁盘、对象存储；\n3. **元数据引擎**：存储数据对应的元数据，支持 Redis、MySQL、SQLite 等多种引擎；\n\n![JuiceFS Architecture](docs/zh_cn/images/juicefs-arch-new.png)\n\nJuiceFS 依靠 Redis 来存储文件的元数据。Redis 是基于内存的高性能的键值数据存储，非常适合存储元数据。与此同时，所有数据将通过 JuiceFS 客户端存储到对象存储中。[了解详情](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/architecture)\n\n![Data structure diagram](docs/en/images/data-structure-diagram.svg)\n\n任何存入 JuiceFS 的文件都会被拆分成固定大小的 **\"Chunk\"**，默认的容量上限是 64 MiB。每个 Chunk 由一个或多个 **\"Slice\"** 组成，Slice 的长度不固定，取决于文件写入的方式。每个 Slice 又会被进一步拆分成固定大小的 **\"Block\"**，默认为 4 MiB。最后，这些 Block 会被存储到对象存储。与此同时，JuiceFS 会将每个文件以及它的 Chunks、Slices、Blocks 等元数据信息存储在元数据引擎中。[了解详情](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/architecture#%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%AD%98%E5%82%A8%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6)\n\n![How JuiceFS stores your files](docs/zh_cn/images/how-juicefs-stores-files.svg)\n\n使用 JuiceFS，文件最终会被拆分成 Chunks、Slices 和 Blocks 存储在对象存储。因此，你会发现在对象存储平台的文件浏览器中找不到存入 JuiceFS 的源文件，存储桶中只有一个 chunks 目录和一堆数字编号的目录和文件。不要惊慌，这正是 JuiceFS 高性能运作的秘诀！\n\n## 开始使用\n\n创建 JuiceFS，需要以下 3 个方面的准备：\n\n1. 准备 Redis 数据库\n2. 准备对象存储\n3. 下载安装 [JuiceFS 客户端](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/installation)\n\n请参照 [快速上手指南](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/quick_start_guide) 立即开始使用 JuiceFS！\n\n### 命令索引\n\n请点击 [这里](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/command_reference) 查看所有子命令以及命令行参数。\n\n### 容器\n\nJuiceFS 可以为 Docker、Podman 等容器化技术提供持久化存储，请查阅 [文档](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/juicefs_on_docker) 了解详情。\n\n### Kubernetes\n\n在 Kubernetes 中使用 JuiceFS 非常便捷，请查看 [这个文档](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/how_to_use_on_kubernetes) 了解更多信息。\n\n### Hadoop Java SDK\n\nJuiceFS 使用 [Hadoop Java SDK](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/hadoop_java_sdk) 与 Hadoop 生态结合。\n\n## 进阶主题\n\n- [Redis 最佳实践](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/redis_best_practices)\n- [如何设置对象存储](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/how_to_setup_object_storage)\n-

[pjdfstest](https://github.com/pjd/pjdfstest) 最新版所有 8813 项兼容性测试。\n\n```\nAll tests successful.\n\nTest Summary Report\n-------------------\n/root/soft/pjdfstest/tests/chown/00.t          (Wstat: 0 Tests: 1323 Failed: 0)\n  TODO passed:   693, 697, 708-709, 714-715, 729, 733\nFiles=235, Tests=8813, 233 wallclock secs ( 2.77 usr  0.38 sys +  2.57 cusr  3.93 csys =  9.65 CPU)\nResult: PASS\n```\n\n除了 pjdfstest 覆盖的那些 POSIX 特性外，JuiceFS 还支持：\n\n- 关闭再打开（close-to-open）一致性。一旦一个文件写入完成并关闭，之后的打开和读操作保证可以访问之前写入的数据。如果是在同一个挂载点，所有写入的数据都可以立即读。\n- 重命名以及所有其他元数据操作都是原子的，由 Redis 的事务机制保证。\n- 当文件被删除后，同一个挂载点上如果已经打开了，文件还可以继续访问。\n- 支持 mmap\n- 支持 fallocate 以及空洞\n- 支持扩展属性\n- 支持 BSD 锁（flock）\n- 支持 POSIX 记录锁（fcntl）\n\n## 性能测试\n\n### 基础性能测试\n\nJuiceFS 提供一个性能测试的子命令来帮助你了解它在你的环境中的性能表现：\n\n![JuiceFS

为什么不支持某个对象存储？\n\n已经支持了绝大部分对象存储，参考这个[列表](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/how_to_setup_object_storage#支持的存储服务)。如果它跟 S3 兼容的话，也可以当成 S3 来使用。否则，请创建一个 issue 来增加支持。\n\n### 是否可以使用 Redis 集群版作为元数据引擎？\n\n可以。自 [v1.0.0 Beta3](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta3) 版本开始 JuiceFS 支持使用 [Redis 集群版](https://redis.io/docs/manual/scaling)作为元数据引擎，不过需要注意的是 Redis 集群版要求一个事务中所有操作的 key 必须在同一个 hash slot 中，因此一个 JuiceFS 文件系统只能使用一个 hash slot。\n\n请查看[「Redis 最佳实践」](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/redis_best_practices)了解更多信息。\n\n### JuiceFS 与 XXX 的区别是什么？\n\n请查看[「同类技术对比」](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/comparison/juicefs_vs_alluxio)文档了解更多信息。\n\n更多 FAQ 请查看[完整列表](https://juicefs.com/docs/zh/community/faq)。\n\n## 历史加星\n\n[![Stargazers over
