This also impacts all AWS integrations and any custom AWS log integration which uses the `aws-s3` input polling mode. When using Filebeat, please add a `default_region` configuration with the region of the S3 bucket. For example:\n+\n[\"source\",\"yaml\"]\n----\nfilebeat.inputs:\n- type: aws-s3\n  enabled: true\n  credential_profile_name: elastic-observability\n  default_region: us-east-2\n  number_of_workers: 5\n  bucket_arn: 'arn:aws:s3:::test1'\n----\n\n==== Breaking changes\n\n*Affecting all Beats*\n\n- Fix FQDN being lowercased when used as `host.hostname`. {issue}39993[39993]\n- Beats won't log start up information when running under the Elastic Agent. {pull}40390[40390]\n- Filebeat now needs `dup3`, `faccessat2`, `prctl` and `setrlimit` syscalls to run the journald input. If this input is not being used, the syscalls are not needed. All Beats have those syscalls allowed now because the default seccomp policy is global to all Beats. {pull}40061[40061]\n- Beats will rate limit the logs about errors when indexing events on Elasticsearch, logging a summary every 10s. The logs sent to the event log is unchanged. {issue}40157[40157]\n\n*Filebeat*\n\n- Filebeat, when running with Elastic-Agent, reports status for Filestream input. {pull}40121[40121]\n- Added support for hyphens in extension keys in `decode_cef` Filebeat processor. {pull}40427[40427]\n- Journald: removed configuration options `include_matches.or`, `include_matches.and`, `backoff`, `max_backoff`, `cursor_seek_fallback`. {pull}40061[40061]\n- Journald: `include_matches.match` now behaves in the same way as matchers in `journalctl`. Users should carefully update their input configuration. {pull}40061[40061]\n- Journald: `seek` and `since` behaviour have been simplified, if there is a cursor (state) `seek` and `since` are ignored and the cursor is used. {pull}40061[40061]\n- Redis: Added replication role as a field to submitted slowlogs.\n- Added `container.image.name` to `journald` Filebeat input's Docker-specific translated fields. {pull}40450[40450]\n- Remove deprecated awscloudwatch field from Filebeat. {pull}41089[41089]\n- The performance of ingesting SQS data with the S3 input has improved by up to 60x for queues with many small events. `max_number_of_messages` config for SQS mode is now ignored, as the new design no longer needs a manual cap on messages. Instead, use `number_of_workers` to scale ingestion rate in both S3 and SQS modes. The increased efficiency may increase network bandwidth consumption, which can be throttled by lowering `number_of_workers`. It may also increase number of events stored in memory, which can be throttled by lowering the configured size of the internal queue. {pull}40699[40699]\n\n*Metricbeat*\n\n- Add support for specifying a custom endpoint for GCP service clients. {issue}40848[40848] {pull}40918[40918]\n\n==== Bugfixes\n\n*Auditbeat*\n\n- Request status from a separate socket to avoid data congestion. {pull}41207[41207]\n\n*Filebeat*\n\n- Fix crashes in the journald input. {pull}40061[40061]\n- Fix long filepaths in diagnostics exceeding max path limits on Windows. {pull}40909[40909]\n- Fix a bug in Salesforce input to only handle responses with 200 status code. {pull}41015[41015]\n- Fixed failed job handling and removed false-positive error logs in the GCS input. {pull}41142[41142]\n- Bump github.com/elastic/go-sfdc dependency used by x-pack/filebeat/input/salesforce. {pull}41192[41192]\n- Journald input now can read events from all boots {issue}41083[41083] {pull}41244[41244]\n- Fix errors in SQS host resolution in the `aws-s3` input when using custom (non-AWS) endpoints. {pull}41504[41504]\n\n*Metricbeat*\n\n- Add GCP 'instance_id' resource label in ECS cloud fields. {issue}40033[40033] {pull}40062[40062]\n- Remove excessive info-level logs in cgroups setup. {pull}40491[40491]\n- Fix http server helper SSL config. {pull}39405[39405]\n\n==== Added\n\n*Filebeat*\n\n- Implement Elastic Agent status and health reporting for Netflow Filebeat input. {pull}40080[40080]\n- Add SSL and username support for Redis input, now the input includes support for Redis 6.0+. {pull}40111[40111]\n- Add scaling up support for Netflow input. {issue}37761[37761] {pull}40122[40122]\n- Update CEL mito extensions to v1.15.0. {pull}40294[40294]\n- Improve logging in Okta Entity Analytics provider. {issue}40106[40106] {pull}40347[40347]\n- Document `winlog` input. {issue}40074[40074] {pull}40462[40462]\n- Added retry logic to websocket connections in the streaming input. {issue}40271[40271] {pull}40601[40601]\n- Disable event normalization for netflow input. {pull}40635[40635]\n- Allow attribute selection in the Active Directory entity analytics provider. {issue}40482[40482] {pull}40662[40662]\n- Improve error quality when CEL program does not correctly return an events array. {pull}40580[40580]\n- Added support for Microsoft Entra ID RBAC authentication. {issue}40434[40434] {pull}40879[40879]\n- Add `use_kubeadm` config option for filebeat (both filbeat.input and autodiscovery) in order to toggle kubeadm-config api requests. {pull}40301[40301]\n- Make HTTP library function inclusion non-conditional in CEL input. {pull}40912[40912]\n- Add support for Crowdstrike streaming API to the streaming input. {issue}40264[40264] {pull}40838[40838]\n- Add support to CEL for reading host environment variables. {issue}40762[40762] {pull}40779[40779]\n- Add CSV decoder to awss3 input. {pull}40896[40896]\n- Change request trace logging to include headers instead of complete request. {pull}41072[41072]\n- Improved GCS input documentation. {pull}41143[41143]\n- Add CSV decoding capacity to azureblobstorage input. {pull}40978[40978]\n- Add CSV decoding capacity to gcs input. {pull}40979[40979]\n- Add support to source AWS cloudwatch logs from linked accounts. {pull}41188[41188]\n- Jounrald input now supports filtering by facilities. {pull}41061[41061]\n- Add support to include AWS cloudwatch linked accounts when using log_group_name_prefix to define log group names. {pull}41206[41206]\n\n*Heartbeat*\n\n- Add journey duration to synthetics browser events. {pull}40230[40230]\n\n*Metricbeat*\n\n- Add new metrics fot datastore and minor changes to overall vSphere metrics. {pull}40766[40766]\n- Add new metricset datastorecluster for vSphere module. {pull}40634[40634] {pull}40694[40694]\n- Add AWS Cloudwatch capability to retrieve tags from AWS/ApiGateway resources. {pull}40755[40755]\n- Add new metrics for the vSphere Virtualmachine metricset. {pull}40485[40485]\n- Add `metrics_count` to Prometheus module if `metrics_count: true` is set. {pull}40411[40411]\n\n\n[[release-notes-8.15.5]]\n=== Beats version 8.15.5\nhttps://github.com/elastic/beats/compare/v8.15.4\\...v8.15.5[View commits]\n\n==== Breaking changes\n\n*Packetbeat*\n\n- Expire source port mappings. {pull}41581[41581]\n\n==== Bugfixes\n\n*Affecting all Beats*\n\n- Fix metrics not being ingested, due to \"Limit of total fields [10000] has been exceeded while adding new fields [...]\".

`modules.d` configuration directory is\ninstalled in the wrong path in the Metricbeat DEB and RPM packages.  This issue\nresults in an empty list when you run `metricbeat modules list` and failures\nwhen you try to enable or disable modules. To work around this issue, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n[source,sh]\n-----------\nsudo cp -r /usr/share/metricbeat/modules.d /etc/metricbeat/\n-----------\n\nThis issue affects all new installations on DEB and RPM. Upgrades will run, but\nuse old configurations defined in the `modules.d` directory from the previous\ninstallation.\n\nThe issue will be fixed in the 6.4.1 release.\n\n==== Breaking changes\n\n*Affecting all Beats*\n\n- Set default kafka version to 1.0.0 in kafka output.

Instead, use `number_of_workers` to scale ingestion rate in both S3 and SQS modes. The increased efficiency may increase network bandwidth consumption, which can be throttled by lowering `number_of_workers`. It may also increase number of events stored in memory, which can be throttled by lowering the configured size of the internal queue. {pull}40699[40699]\n- Fixes filestream logging the error \"filestream input with ID 'ID' already exists, this will lead to data duplication[...]\" on Kubernetes when using autodiscover. {pull}41585[41585]\n- Add kafka compression support for ZSTD.\n- Filebeat fails to start if there is any input with a duplicated ID.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The Beats\nsend the operational data to Elasticsearch, either directly or via Logstash, so\nit can be visualized with Kibana.\n\nBy \"lightweight\", we mean that Beats have a small installation footprint, use\nlimited system resources, and have no runtime dependencies.\n\nThis repository contains\n[libbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/libbeat), our Go\nframework for creating Beats, and all the officially supported Beats:\n\nBeat  | Description\n--- | ---\n[Auditbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/auditbeat) | Collect your Linux audit framework data and monitor the integrity of your files.\n[Filebeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/filebeat) | Tails and ships log files\n[Heartbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/heartbeat) | Ping remote services for availability\n[Metricbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/metricbeat) | Fetches sets of metrics from the operating system and services\n[Packetbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/packetbeat) | Monitors the network and applications by sniffing packets\n[Winlogbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/winlogbeat) | Fetches and ships Windows Event logs\n[Osquerybeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/main/x-pack/osquerybeat) | Runs Osquery and manages interraction with it.\n\nIn addition to the above Beats, which are officially supported by\n[Elastic](https://elastic.co), the community has created a set of other Beats\nthat make use of libbeat but live outside of this Github repository. We maintain\na list of community Beats\n[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/master/community-beats.html).\n\n## Documentation and Getting Started\n\nYou can find the documentation and getting started guides for each of the Beats\non the [elastic.co site](https://www.elastic.co/guide/):\n\n* [Beats platform](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/index.html)\n* [Auditbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/current/index.html)\n* [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/index.html)\n* [Heartbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/current/index.html)\n* [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/index.html)\n* [Packetbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/index.html)\n* [Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/index.html)\n\n## Documentation and Getting Started information for the Elastic Agent\n\nYou can find the documentation and getting started guides for the Elastic Agent\non the [elastic.co site](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent)\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you need help or hit an issue, please start by opening a topic on our\n[discuss forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/beats). Please note that we\nreserve GitHub tickets for confirmed bugs and enhancement requests.\n\n## Downloads\n\nYou can download pre-compiled Beats binaries, as well as packages for the\nsupported platforms, from [this page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe'd love working with you! You can help make the Beats better in many ways:\nreport issues, help us reproduce issues, fix bugs, add functionality, or even\ncreate your own Beat.\n\nPlease start by reading our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\n\n## Building Beats from the Source\n\nSee our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for information about setting up\nyour dev environment to build Beats from the source.\n\n## Snapshots\n\nFor testing purposes, we generate snapshot builds that you can find [here](https://artifacts-api.elastic.co/v1/search/8.0-SNAPSHOT/). Please be aware that these are built on top of main and are not meant for production.\n\n## CI\n\n### PR Comments\n\nIt is possible to trigger some jobs by putting a comment on a GitHub PR.\n(This service is only available for users affiliated with Elastic and not for open-source contributors.)\n\n* [beats CI pipeline](https://buildkite.com/elastic/beats)\n  * `/test` will kick off a default build.\n\n### PR Labels\n\nIt's possible to configure the build on a GitHub PR by labeling the PR with certain labels. Elastic users can find more details at https://docs.elastic.dev/ingest-dev-docs/beats/beats-ci.\n"
