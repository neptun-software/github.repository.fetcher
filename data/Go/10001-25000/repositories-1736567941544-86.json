Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.\n\nPlease fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).\n\n  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/node/285/node/285/individual-signup).\n  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/node/285/organization-signup).\n\nFollow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.\n\n### Contributing A Patch\n\n1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.\n1. The [repo owners](OWNERS) will respond to your issue promptly.\n1. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).\n1. If instructed by the repo owners provide a short design document in a PR.\n1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. Unit tests are required for most PRs.\n1. Submit a pull request.\n\n### Adding dependencies\n\nIf your patch depends on new packages, follow the [instructions to add a dependency](/docs/development/vendoring.md#adding-a-dependency-to-the-vendor-directory).\n\n## Bug reporting\n\nIf you think you found a bug, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/new)\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

This time is used to gather with community members interested in kOps. This session is open to both developers and users.\n\nWe do maintain an [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12QkyL0FkNbWPcLFxxRGSPt_tNPBHbmni3YLY-lHny7E/edit) and stick to it as much as possible. If you want to hold the floor, put your item in this doc. Bullet/note form is fine. Even if your topic gets in late, we do our best to cover it.\n\nFor more information about the office hours and how to join, see [Office Hours](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/welcome/office_hours/)\n"

          "content": "# ROADMAP\n\n## VERSION SUPPORT\nkOps 1.N.x _officially_ supports Kubernetes 1.N.x and prior versions. We understand that those in the community run a wide selection of versions and we do our best to maintain backward compatibility as far as we can. \n\nHowever, kOps 1.N.x does NOT support Kubernetes 1.N+1.x. Sometimes you get lucky and kOps 1.N will technically install a later version of Kubernetes, but we cannot guarantee or support this situation. As always, we recommend waiting for the official release of kOps with minor version >= the version of Kubernetes you wish to install. Please see the [compatibility matrix](README.md#Compatibility_Matrix) for further questions.\n\n## RELEASE SCHEDULE\nThere is a natural lag between the release of Kubernetes and the corresponding version of kOps that has full support for it. While the first patch versions of a minor Kubernetes release are burning in, the kOps team races to incorporate all the updates needed to release. Once we have both some stability in the upstream version of Kubernetes AND full support in kOps, we will cut a release that includes version specific configuration and a selection of add-ons to match.\n\nIn practice, sometimes this means that kOps release lags the upstream release by 1 or more months. We sincerely try to avoid this scenario- we understand how important this project is and respect the need that teams have to maintain their clusters. \n\nOur goal is to have an official kOps release no later than a month after the corresponding Kubernetes version is released. Please help us achieve this timeline and meet our goals by jumping in and giving us a hand. We always need assistance closing issues, reviewing PRs, and contributing code! Stop by office hours if you're interested. \n\nA rough outline of the timeline/release cycle with respect to the Kubernetes release follows. We are revising the automation around the release process so that we can get alpha and beta releases out to the community and other developers much faster for testing and to get more eyes on open issues.\n\nExample release timeline based on Kubernetes quarterly release cycle:\n\nJuly 1: Kubernetes 1.W.0 is released.  \nJuly 7: kOps 1.W.beta1  \nJuly 21: kOps 1.W.0 released  \nAugust 15: kOps 1.W+1alpha1  \nAugust 31: kOps 1.W+1alpha2  \n\n... etc\n\nSeptember 25: Kubernetes1.W+1.RC-X  \nOct 1: Kubernetes 1.W+1.0  \nOct 7: kOps 1.W+1beta1  \nOct 21: kOps 1.W+1.0  \n\n\n## UPCOMING RELEASES\n\n### kOps 1.17\n\n* Full support for Kubernetes 1.17\n\n### kOps 1.18\n\n* Full support for Kubernetes 1.18\n* Support for Containerd as an alternate container runtime\n* Surging and greater parallelism in rolling updates\n\n## UPCOMING FEATURES\nNB: These are features that are in process and may be introduced behind flags or in alpha capacity but are not explicitly targeting specific releases. \n\n* Documentation revamp that is closer to k8s.io: Stories and walkthroughs of common scenarios, restructure and update information\n* Additional cloud provider support: spotinst, aliyun, azure...?\n* Revisit recommended base cluster configurations to get them modernized. Update recommendations and defaults for instances, disks, etc, \n* Improved node bootstrapping\n"
