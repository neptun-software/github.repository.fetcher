You can help us in different ways:\n\n- [Open an issue](https://github.com/tinode/chat/issues) with suggestions for improvements\n- Fork this repository and submit a pull request\n- Improve the documentation\n\n\nTo submit a pull request, fork the [repository](https://github.com/tinode/chat) and then clone your fork:\n\n    git clone git@github.com:<your-repo-name>/chat.git\n\nMake your suggested changes, `git push` and then [submit a pull request](https://github.com/tinode/chat/compare/). Note that before we can accept your pull requests, you need to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](docs/CLA.md).\n\n\n## Why is the Contributor License Agreement necessary?\n\nWe very much appreciate your wanting to contribute to Tinode Chat, but we need to add you to the contributors list first. Note that the [agreement](docs/CLA.md) is not a transfer of copyright ownership, this simply is a license agreement for contributions. You also do not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose. For some background on why contributor license agreements are necessary, you can read FAQs from many other open source projects:\n\n- Django's [CLA FAQ](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/faq/)\n- A [chapter](http://producingoss.com/en/copyright-assignment.html) from Karl Fogel's _Producing Open Source Software_ on CLAs\n- The [Wikipedia article on CLAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_license_agreement)\n\nThis is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some red tape, but protects both the contributor and the company / foundation behind the project. It also gives us the option to relicense the code with a more permissive license in the future.\n"

          "content": "# Installing Tinode\n\nThe config file [`tinode.conf`](./server/tinode.conf) contains extensive instructions on configuring the server.\n\n## Installing from Binaries\n\n1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/tinode/chat/releases/), choose the latest or otherwise the most suitable release. From the list of binaries download the one for your database and platform. Once the binary is downloaded, unpack it to a directory of your choosing, `cd` to that directory.\n\n2. Make sure your database is running. Make sure it's configured to accept connections from `localhost`. In case of MySQL, Tinode will try to connect as `root` without the password. In case of PostgreSQL, Tinode will try connect as `postgres` with the password `postgres`. See notes below (_Building from Source_, section 4) on how to configure Tinode to use a different user or a password. MySQL 5.7 or above is required. MySQL 5.6 or below **will not work**. PostgreSQL 13 or above is required. PostgreSQL 12 or below **will not work**.\n\n3. Run the database initializer `init-db` (or `init-db.exe` on Windows):\n\t```\n\t./init-db -data=data.json\n\t```\n\n4. Run the `tinode` (or `tinode.exe` on Windows) server. It will work without any parameters.\n\t```\n\t./tinode\n\t```\n\n5. Test your installation by pointing your browser to http://localhost:6060/\n\n\n## Docker\n\nSee [instructions](./docker/README.md)\n\n\n## Building from Source\n\n1. Install [Go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install). The installation instructions below are for Go 1.18 and newer.\n\n2. OPTIONAL only if you intend to modify the code: Install [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/) including [code generator](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go-generated) for Go.\n\n3. Make sure one of the following databases is installed and running:\n * MySQL 5.7 or above. MySQL 5.6 or below **will not work**.\n * PostgreSQL 13 or above. PostgreSQL 12 or below **will not work**.\n * MongoDB 4.2 or above.\n * RethinkDB.\n\n4. Fetch, build Tinode server and tinode-db database initializer:\n  - **MySQL**:\n\t```\n\tgo install -tags mysql github.com/tinode/chat/server@latest\n\tgo install -tags mysql github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db@latest\n\t```\n  - **PostgreSQL**:\n\t```\n\tgo install -tags postgres github.com/tinode/chat/server@latest\n\tgo install -tags postgres github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db@latest\n\t```\n  - **MongoDB**:\n\t```\n\tgo install -tags mongodb github.com/tinode/chat/server@latest\n\tgo install -tags mongodb github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db@latest\n\t```\n  - **RethinkDb**:\n\t```\n\tgo install -tags rethinkdb github.com/tinode/chat/server@latest\n\tgo install -tags rethinkdb github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db@latest\n\t```\n  - **All** (bundle all of the above DB adapters):\n\t```\n\tgo install -tags \"mysql rethinkdb mongodb postgres\" github.com/tinode/chat/server@latest\n\tgo install -tags \"mysql rethinkdb mongodb postgres\" github.com/tinode/chat/tinode-db@latest\n\t```\n\n    The steps above install Tinode binaries at `$GOPATH/bin/`, sorces and supporting files are located at `$GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/tinode/chat@vX.XX.X/` where `X.XX.X` is the version you installed, such as `0.19.1`.\n\n    Note the required **`-tags rethinkdb`**, **`-tags mysql`**, **`-tags mongodb`** or **`-tags postgres`** build option.\n\n    You may also optionally define `main.buildstamp` for the server by adding a build option, for instance, with a timestamp:\n    ```\n    go install -tags mysql -ldflags \"-X main.buildstamp=`date -u '+%Y%m%dT%H:%M:%SZ'`\" github.com/tinode/chat/server@latest\n    ```\n    The value of `buildstamp` will be sent by the server to the clients.\n\n    Building with Go 1.17 or below **will fail**!\n\n5. Open `tinode.conf` (located at `$GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/tinode/chat@vX.XX.X/server/`). Check that the database connection parameters are correct for your database. If you are using MySQL make sure [DSN](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name) in `\"mysql\"` section is appropriate for your MySQL installation. Option `parseTime=true` is required.\n```js\n\t\"mysql\": {\n\t\t\"dsn\": \"root@tcp(localhost)/tinode?parseTime=true\",\n\t\t\"database\": \"tinode\"\n\t},\n```\n\n6. Make sure you specify the adapter name in your `tinode.conf`. E.g. you want to run Tinode with MySQL:\n```js\n\t\"store_config\": {\n\t\t...\n\t\t\"use_adapter\": \"mysql\",\n\t\t...\n\t},\n```\n\n7. Now that you have built the binaries, follow instructions in the _Running a Standalone Server_ section.\n\n\n## Running a Standalone Server\n\nIf you followed instructions in the previous section then the Tinode binaries are installed in `$GOPATH/bin/`, the sources and supporting files are located in `$GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/tinode/chat@vX.XX.X/`, where `X.XX.X` is the version you installed, for example `0.19.1`.\n\nSwitch to sources directory (replace `X.XX.X` with your actual version, such as `0.19.1`):\n```\ncd $GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/tinode/chat@vX.XX.X\n```\n\n1. Make sure your database is running:\n - **MySQL**: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-startstop-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-server.html\n\t```\n\tmysql.server start\n\t```\n - **PostgreSQL**: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-ctl.html\n\t```\n\tpg_ctl start\n\t```\n - **MongoDB**: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/\nMongoDB should run as single node replicaset. See https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/replica-set-deployment/\n\t```\n\tmongod\n\t```\n - **RethinkDB**: https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/start-a-server/\n\t```\n\trethinkdb --bind all --daemon\n\t```\n\n2. Run DB initializer\n\t```\n\t$GOPATH/bin/init-db -config=./tinode-db/tinode.conf\n\t```\n\tadd `-data=./tinode-db/data.json` flag if you want sample data to be loaded:\n\t```\n\t$GOPATH/bin/init-db -config=./tinode-db/tinode.conf -data=./tinode-db/data.json\n\t```\n\n\tDB initializer needs to be run only once per installation. See [instructions](tinode-db/README.md) for more options.\n\n3. Unpack JS client to a directory, for instance `$HOME/tinode/webapp/` by unzipping `https://github.com/tinode/webapp/archive/master.zip` and `https://github.com/tinode/tinode-js/archive/master.zip` to the same directory.\n\n4. Copy or symlink template directory `./server/templ` to `$GOPATH/bin/templ`\n\t```\n\tln -s ./server/templ $GOPATH/bin\n\t```\n\n5. Run the server\n\t```\n\t$GOPATH/bin/tinode -config=./server/tinode.conf -static_data=$HOME/tinode/webapp/\n\t```\n\n6. Test your installation by pointing your browser to [http://localhost:6060/](http://localhost:6060/). The static files from the `-static_data` path are served at web root `/`. You can change this by editing the line `static_mount` in the config file.\n\n**Important!** If you are running Tinode alongside another webserver, such as Apache or nginx, keep in mind that you need to launch the webapp from the URL served by Tinode. Otherwise it won't work.\n\n\n## Running a Cluster\n\n- Install and run the database, run DB initializer, unpack JS files, and link or copy template directory as described in the previous section. Both MySQL and RethinkDB supports [cluster](https://www.mysql.com/products/cluster/) [mode](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/start-a-server/#a-rethinkdb-cluster-using-multiple-machines). You may consider it for added resiliency.\n\n- Cluster expects at least two nodes. A minimum of three nodes is recommended.\n\n- The following section configures the cluster.\n\n```\n\t\"cluster_config\": {\n\t\t// Name of the current node.\n\t\t\"self\": \"\",\n\t\t// List of all cluster nodes, including the current one.\n\t\t\"nodes\": [\n\t\t\t{\"name\": \"one\", \"addr\":\"localhost:12001\"},\n\t\t\t{\"name\": \"two\", \"addr\":\"localhost:12002\"},\n\t\t\t{\"name\": \"three\", \"addr\":\"localhost:12003\"}\n\t\t],\n\t\t// Configuration of failover feature. Don't change.\n\t\t\"failover\": {\n\t\t\t\"enabled\": true,\n\t\t\t\"heartbeat\": 100,\n\t\t\t\"vote_after\": 8,\n\t\t\t\"node_fail_after\": 16\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\n* `self` is the name of the current node. Generally it's more convenient to specify the name of the current node at the command line using `cluster_self` option. Command line value overrides the config file value. If the value is not provided either in the config file or through the command line, the clustering is disabled.\n* `nodes` defines individual cluster nodes. The sample defines three nodes named `one`, `two`, and `tree` running at the localhost at the specified cluster communication ports. Cluster addresses don't need to be exposed to the outside world.\n* `failover` is an experimental feature which migrates topics from failed cluster nodes keeping them accessible:\n  * `enabled` turns on failover mode; failover mode requires at least three nodes in the cluster.\n  * `heartbeat` interval in milliseconds between heartbeats sent by the leader node to follower nodes to ensure they are accessible.\n  * `vote_after` number of failed heartbeats before a new leader node is elected.\n  * `node_fail_after` number of heartbeats that a follower node misses before it's considered to be down.\n\nIf you are testing the cluster with all nodes running on the same host, you also must override the `listen` and `grpc_listen` ports. Here is an example for launching two cluster nodes from the same host using the same config file:\n```\n$GOPATH/bin/tinode -config=./server/tinode.conf -static_data=./server/webapp/ -listen=:6060 -grpc_listen=:6080 -cluster_self=one &\n$GOPATH/bin/tinode -config=./server/tinode.conf -static_data=./server/webapp/ -listen=:6061 -grpc_listen=:6081 -cluster_self=two &\n```\nA bash script [run-cluster.sh](./server/run-cluster.sh) may be found useful.\n\n### Enabling Push Notifications\n\nFollow [instructions](./docs/faq.md#q-how-to-setup-push-notifications-with-google-fcm).\n\n\n### Enabling Video Calls\n\nVideo calls use [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC). WebRTC is a peer to peer protocol: once the call is established, the client applications exchange data directly. Direct data exchange is efficient but creates a problem when the parties are not accessible from the internet. WebRTC solves it by means of [ICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment) servers  which implement protocols [TURN(S)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT) and [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) as fallback.\n\nTinode does not provide ICE servers out of the box. You must install and configure (or purchase) your own servers otherwise video and voice calling will not be available.\n\nOnce you obtain the ICE TURN/STUN configuration from your service provider, add it to `tinode.conf` section `\"webrtc\"` - `\"ice_servers\"` (or `\"ice_servers_file\"`). Also change `\"webrtc\"` - `\"enabled\"` to `true`. An example configuration is provided in the `tinode.conf` for illustration only. IT WILL NOT FUNCTION because it uses dummy values instead of actual server addresses.\n\nYou may find this information useful for choosing the servers: https://gist.github.com/yetithefoot/7592580\n\n\n### Note on Running the Server in Background\n\nThere is [no clean way](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/227) to daemonize a Go process internally. One must use external tools such as shell `&` operator, `systemd`, `launchd`, `SMF`, `daemon tools`, `runit`, etc. to run the process in the background.\n\nSpecific note for [nohup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup) users: an `exit` must be issued immediately after `nohup` call to close the foreground session cleanly:\n\n```\nnohup $GOPATH/bin/server -config=./server/tinode.conf -static_data=$HOME/tinode/webapp/ &\nexit\n```\n\nOtherwise `SIGHUP` may be received by the server if the shell connection is broken before the ssh session has terminated (indicated by `Connection to XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX port 22: Broken pipe`). In such a case the server will shutdown because `SIGHUP` is intercepted by the server and interpreted as a shutdown request.\n\nFor more details see https://github.com/tinode/chat/issues/25.\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

Backend in pure [Go](http://golang.org) (license [GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)), clients for Android (Java), iOS (Swift), and web (ReactJS), as well as [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) client support for C++, C#, Go, Java, Node, PHP, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, etc (all clients licensed under [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). Wire transport is JSON over websocket (long polling is also available) or [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) with gRPC.\n\nThis is beta-quality software: feature-complete and stable but probably with a few bugs or missing features. Follow [instructions](INSTALL.md) to install and run or use one of the cloud services below. Read [API documentation](docs/API.md).\n\nTinode is *not* XMPP/Jabber. It is *not* compatible with XMPP. It's meant as a replacement for XMPP. On the surface, it's a lot like open source WhatsApp or Telegram.\n\n<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tinode/id1483763538\"><img src=\"docs/app-store.svg\" height=36></a> <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinode.tindroidx\"><img src=\"docs/play-store.svg\" height=36></a> <a href=\"https://web.tinode.co/\"><img src=\"docs/web-app.svg\" height=36></a>\n\n## Why?\n\nThe promise of [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) was to deliver federated instant messaging: anyone would be able to spin up an IM server capable of exchanging messages with any other XMPP server in the world. Unfortunately, XMPP never delivered on this promise. Instant messengers are still a bunch of incompatible walled gardens, similar to what AoL of the late 1990s was to the open Internet.\n\nThe goal of this project is to deliver on XMPP's original vision: create a modern open platform for federated instant messaging with an emphasis on mobile communication. A secondary goal is to create a decentralized IM platform that is much harder to track and block by the governments.\n\nAn explicit NON-goal: we are not building yet another Slack replacement.\n\n## Installing and running\n\nSee [general instructions](./INSTALL.md) or [docker-specific instructions](./docker/README.md).\n\n## Getting support\n\n* Read [API documentation](docs/API.md) and [FAQ](docs/faq.md). Read configuration instructions contained in the [`tinode.conf`](./server/tinode.conf) file.\n* For support, general questions, discussions post to [https://groups.google.com/d/forum/tinode](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/tinode).\n* For bugs and feature requests [open an issue](https://github.com/tinode/chat/issues/new/choose).\n* Use https://tinode.co/contact for commercial inquiries.\n\n## Helping out\n\n* If you appreciate our work, please help spread the word! Sharing on Reddit, HN, and other communities helps more than you think.\n* Consider buying paid support: https://tinode.co/support.html\n* If you are a software developer, send us your pull requests with bug fixes and new features.\n* If you use the app and discover bugs or missing features, let us know by filing bug reports and feature requests. Vote for existing [feature requests](https://github.com/tinode/chat/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3A%22feature+request%22) you find most valuable.\n* If you speak a language other than English, [translate](docs/translations.md) the apps into your language. You may also review and improve existing translations.\n* If you are a UI/UX expert, help us polish the app UI.\n* Use it: install it for your colleagues or friends at work or at home.\n\n## Public service\n\nA [public Tinode service](https://web.tinode.co/) is available. You can use it just like any other instant messenger. Keep in mind that demo accounts present in [sandbox](https://sandbox.tinode.co/) are not available in the public service. You must register an account using valid email in order to use the service.\n\n### Web\n\nTinodeWeb, a single page web app, is available at https://web.tinode.co/ ([source](https://github.com/tinode/webapp/)). See screenshots below.\n\n### Android\n\n[Tinode for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinode.tindroidx) a.k.a Tindroid is stable and functional ([source](https://github.com/tinode/tindroid)). See the screenshots below. A [debug APK](https://github.com/tinode/tindroid/releases/latest) is also provided for convenience.\n\n### iOS\n\n[Tinode for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tinode/id1483763538) a.k.a. Tinodios is stable and functional ([source](https://github.com/tinode/ios)). See the screenshots below.\n\n\n## Demo/Sandbox\n\nA sandboxed demo service is available at https://sandbox.tinode.co/.\n\nLog in as one of `alice`, `bob`, `carol`, `dave`, `frank`. Password is `<login>123`, e.g. login for `alice` is `alice123`. You can discover other users by email or phone by prefixing them with `email:` or `tel:` respectively. Emails are `<login>@example.com`, e.g. `alice@example.com`, phones are `+17025550001` through `+17025550009`.\n\nWhen you register a new account you are asked for an email address to send validation code to. For demo purposes you may use `123456` as a universal validation code. The code you get in the email is also valid.\n\n### Sandbox Notes\n\n* The sandbox server is reset (all data wiped) every night at 3:15am Pacific time. An error message `User not found or offline` means the server was reset while you were connected. If you see it on the web, reload and relogin. On Android log out and re-login. If the database was changed, delete the app then reinstall.\n* Sandbox user `Tino` is a [basic chatbot](./chatbot) which responds with a [random quote](http://fortunes.cat-v.org/) to any message.\n* As generally accepted, when you register a new account you are asked for an email address. The server will send an email with a verification code to that address and you can use it to validate the account. To make things easier for testing, the server will also accept `123456` as a verification code. Remove line `\"debug_response\": \"123456\"` from `tinode.conf` to disable this option.\n* The sandbox server is configured to use [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS [implementation](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/acme) with hard-coded requirement for [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). If you are unable to connect then the most likely reason is your TLS client's missing support for SNI.

For up to date info use [README.md](./README.md)\n\n\n<img src=\"docs/logo.svg\" align=\"left\" width=128 height=128> 인스턴트 메시징 서버. C++, C#, [Go](http://golang.org), Java, Node, PHP, Python, Ruby, Objective-C 등에 대한 [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) 클라이언트 지원은 물론 순수Go(라이선스 [GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html))의 백엔드와 Java,Javasript 및 Swift의 클라이언트 측 바인딩(라이선스 [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). 와이어 전송은 사용자 정의 바인딩을 위해 웹소켓을 통한 JSON(롱 폴링도 가능) 즉, gRPC와 [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). 영구 저장소 [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/), MySQL 및 MongoDB(실험적). 지원되지 않는 타사 [DynamoDB adapter](https://github.com/riandyrn/chat/tree/master/server/db/dynamodb) adapter도 있습니다. 사용자 정의 어댑터를 작성하여 다른 데이터베이스를 지원할 수 있습니다.\n\nTinode는 XMPP/ Jabber 가 아닙니다. Tinode는 XMPP와 호환되지 않습니다. XMPP를 대체하기 위한 것입니다. 표면적으로는 오픈소스 WhatsApp 또는 Telegram과 매우 유사합니다.\n\n버전 0.16은 베타 급 소프트웨어입니다. 기능은 완전하지만 몇 가지 버그가 있습니다. 아래 클라우드 서비스 중 하나를 설치 및 실행하거나 사용하려면 [지시사항](INSTALL.md)을 따르십시오. [API 설명서](docs/API.md)를 읽으십시오.\n\n<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tinode/id1483763538\"><img src=\"docs/app-store.svg\" height=36></a> <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinode.tindroidx\"><img src=\"docs/play-store.svg\" height=36></a> <a href=\"https://web.tinode.co/\"><img src=\"docs/web-app.svg\" height=36></a>\n\n## Why?\n\n[XMPP](http://xmpp.org/)의 약속은 연합된 인스턴스 메시징을 제공하는 것입니다. 누구나 전세계의 다른 XMPP서버와 메시지를 교환할 수 있는 IM 서버를 가동할 수 있습니다. 불행하게도, XMPP는 이 약속을 이행하지 않았습니다. 인스턴트 메신저들은 1990년대 후반의 AoL공개 인터넷과 비슷한, 양립할 수 없는 벽으로 둘러싸인 정원의 무리들입니다.\n\n이 프로젝트의 목표는 XMPP의 원래 비전인 모바일 통신을 강조하여 연합 인스턴트 메시징을 위한 현대적인 개방형 플랫폼을 만드는 것입니다. 두 번째 목표는 정부가 추적하고 차단하기 훨씬 어려운 분산형 IM플랫폼을 만드는 것입니다.\n\nXMPP: XML에 기반한 메시지 지향 통신 프로토콜\n\nIM: Instant Messanger\n\n## 설치 및 실행\n\n[일반 지침](./INSTALL.md) 또는 [도커별 지침](./docker/README.md)을 참조하십시오.\n\n## 지원받기\n\n* [API 설명서](docs/API.md) 및 [FAQ](docs/faq.md)를 읽으십시오.\n* 지원, 일반적인 질문, 토로은[https://groups.google.com/d/forum/tinode](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/tinode).에 게시하십시오.\n* 버그 및 기능 요청에 대해서는 [issue](https://github.com/tinode/chat/issues/new)를 여십시오.\n\n\n## 공공서비스\n\n[Tinode 공공 서비스](https://web.tinode.co/)는 지금 바로 사용할 수 있습니다. 다른 메신저들처럼 사용하면 됩니다. [샌드박스](https://sandbox.tinode.co/)에 있는 데모 계정은 공공 서비스에서 사용할 수 없습니다. 서비스를 이용하려면 유효한 이메일을 사용하여 계정을 등록해야 합니다.\n\n### 웹\n\nTinode웹은 단일 페이지의 웹으로 https://web.tinode.co/ ([원본](https://github.com/tinode/webapp/))에서 이용이 가능합니다. . 아래에 있는 스크린 샷을 참고하세요. 현재 영어, 중국어 간체, 러시아어를 지원합니다. 더 많은 번역을 환영합니다.\n\n### 안드로이드\n\nTindroid라고 불리는 [안드로이드 버전의 Tinode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.tinode.tindroidx) 는 안정적으로 가동됩니다.  ([원본](https://github.com/tinode/tindroid)).  아래에 있는 스크린 샷을 참고하세요. 편의를 위해 [디버그 APK](https://github.com/tinode/tindroid/releases/latest)도 제공합니다. 현재 영어, 중국어 간체, 러시아어를 지원합니다. 더 많은 번역을 환영합니다.\n\n### iOS\n\nTinodios라고 불리는 [iOS 버전의 Tinode](https://apps.apple.com/app/reference-to-tinodios-here/id123) 안정적으로 가동됩니다.([원본](https://github.com/tinode/ios)). 아래에 있는 스크린샷을 참고하세요. 현재 영어와 중국어 간체를 지원합니다. 더 많은 번역을 환영합니다.\n\n\n## 데모/샌드박스\n샌드박스 데모 버전은 https://sandbox.tinode.co/ 에서 이용 가능합니다.\n\nalice, bob, carol, dave, frank 중 하나로 로그인할 수 있습니다. 비밀번호는 <이름>123으로 예를 들어, alice의 비밀번호는 alice123입니다. 사용자 이름을 맨 앞에쓴 <이름>@example.com 형식의 이메일이나 +17025550001 부터 +17025550009의 전화번호를 이용해서 다른 사용자들을 찾을 수 있습니다.\n\n새로운 계정을 등록하면 유효성 검사 코드를 보낼 이메일 주소를 묻는 메시지가 나타납니다. 데모의 목적으로 123456을 범용 유효성 검사 코드로 사용할 수 있습니다. 실제 이메일로 받은 코드도 유효합니다.\n\n### 샌드박스 노트\n\n* 샌드박스 서버는 태평양 표준시 기준 매일 오전 3시 15분에 초기화됩니다(모든 데이터가 지워짐). 사용자를 찾을 수 없습니다 또는 오프라인 같은 오류 메시지는 서버에 연결하는 동안 서버가 초기화 되었음을 의미합니다. 만약 해당 오류 메시지가 표시되면 새로고침 후 다시 로그인 하세요. 안드로이드에서 로그아웃 후 다시 로그인 하세요. 만약 데이터베이스가 변경된 경우에는 앱을 삭제했다가 다시 설치하면 됩니다.\n* 샌드박스 유저 Tino는 [기본적인 챗봇](./chatbot)으로 모든 메시지에 [임의의 인용구](http://fortunes.cat-v.org/)로 응답합니다.\n* 일반적으로 새로운 계정을 등록하면 이메일 주소를 묻는 메시지가 표시됩니다. 서버는 유효성 검사 코드가 포함된 메일을 보내며 이를 사용하여 계정을 검증하는 데 사용할 수 있습니다. 테스트를 보다 쉽게 할 수 있도록 서버는 유효성 검사 코드로 123456을 또한 허용합니다. Tinode.conf에서 ”debug_response”: “123456”행을 제거하여 이 옵션을 비활성화 시킬 수 있습니다.\n* 샌드박스 서버는 [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication)에 대한 하드 코딩된 요구사항과 함께 [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS [구현](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/acme)을 사용하도록 구성되었습니다. 만약 연결할 수 없을 경우 TLS 클라이언트의 SNI 지원 누락일 가능성이 높습니다. 그 경우 다른 클라이언트를 사용하세요.\n* 기본 웹 앱은 하나의 축소된 자바스크립트 번들과 축소된 CSS를 가져옵니다. 축소되지 않은 버전은 https://sandbox.tinode.co/index-dev.html 에서도 제공됩니다.\n* 데모가 같은 [도커 이미지](https://hub.docker.com/u/tinode/)도 사용 가능합니다.\n* 샌드박스에 대해 소프트웨어를 테스트하고 해킹하는 작업, 기타 작업들을 수행할 수 있습니다. DDos는 절대 사용하지 마세요.\n\n## 특징\n\n### 지원 기능\n\n* [Android](https://github.com/tinode/tindroid/), [iOS](https://github.com/tinode/ios), [web](https://github.com/tinode/webapp/), 그리고 [command line](tn-cli/) 클라이언트.\n* 1대1 메시징.\n* 모든 구성원의 접근 권한을 가진 그룹 메시징을 개별적으로 관리한다. 최대 구성원 수는 설정할 수 있다(기본적으로 128명).\n* 다양한 작업에 대한 권한을 가진 항목 액세스 제어\n* 서버에서 생성한 사용자 및 주제에 대한 존재 알림.\n* 맞춤형 인증 지원\n* failover를 통한 Sharded clustering\n* 영구 메시지 저장소, 페이지가 지정된 메시지 기록\n* 외부 의존성이 없는 javascript 바인딩.\n* Android SDK dependencies.Java 바인딩(의존성: [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [Java-Websocket](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket)).
