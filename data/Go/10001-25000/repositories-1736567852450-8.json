          "content": "# Contribution Guidelines\n\nThank you for your interest in Dapr!\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to signoff on your commits via \nthe Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). When you submit a pull request, a DCO-bot will automatically determine \nwhether you need to provide signoff for your commit. Please follow the instructions provided by DCO-bot, as pull \nrequests cannot be merged until the author(s) have provided signoff to fulfill the DCO requirement.\nYou may find more information on the DCO requirements [below](#developer-certificate-of-origin-signing-your-work).\n\nThis project has adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dapr/community/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).\n\nContributions come in many forms: submitting issues, writing code, participating in discussions and community calls.\n\nThis document provides the guidelines for how to contribute to the Dapr project.\n\n## Issues\n\nThis section describes the guidelines for submitting issues\n\n### Issue Types\n\nThere are 4 types of issues:\n\n- Issue/Bug: You've found a bug with the code, and want to report it, or create an issue to track the bug.\n- Issue/Discussion: You have something on your mind, which requires input from others in a discussion, before it eventually manifests as a proposal.\n- Issue/Proposal: Used for items that propose a new idea or functionality. This allows feedback from others before code is written.\n- Issue/Question: Use this issue type, if you need help or have a question.\n\n### Before You File\n\nBefore you file an issue, make sure you've checked the following:\n\n1. Is it the right repository?\n    - The Dapr project is distributed across multiple repositories. Check the list of [repositories](https://github.com/dapr) if you aren't sure which repo is the correct one.\n1. Check for existing issues\n    - Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.\n    - If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reaction-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction:\n        - 👍 up-vote\n        - 👎 down-vote\n1. For bugs\n    - Check it's not an environment issue. For example, if running on Kubernetes, make sure prerequisites are in place. (state stores, bindings, etc.)\n    - You have as much data as possible. This usually comes in the form of logs and/or stacktrace. If running on Kubernetes or other environment, look at the logs of the Dapr services (runtime, operator, placement service). More details on how to get logs can be found [here](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/troubleshooting/logs-troubleshooting/).\n1. For proposals\n    - Many changes to the Dapr runtime may require changes to the API. In that case, the best place to discuss the potential feature is the main [Dapr repo](https://github.com/dapr/dapr).\n    - Other examples could include bindings, state stores or entirely new components.\n\n## Contributing to Dapr\n\nThis section describes the guidelines for contributing code / docs to Dapr.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nAll contributions come through pull requests. To submit a proposed change, we recommend following this workflow:\n\n1. Make sure there's an issue (bug or proposal) raised, which sets the expectations for the contribution you are about to make.\n1. Fork the relevant repo and create a new branch\n1. Create your change\n    - Code changes require tests\n    - Make sure to run the linters to check and format the code:\n        - `make lint` executes the linter for Go code\n        - `make me prettier` uses Prettier to format JavaScript / JSON files (needed only if you've modified those)\n1. Update relevant documentation for the change\n1. Commit with [DCO sign-off](#developer-certificate-of-origin-signing-your-work) and open a PR\n1. Wait for the CI process to finish and make sure all checks are green\n1. A maintainer of the project will be assigned, and you can expect a review within a few days\n\n#### Use work-in-progress PRs for early feedback\n\nA good way to communicate before investing too much time is to create a \"Work-in-progress\" PR and share it with your reviewers. The standard way of doing this is to add a \"[WIP]\" prefix in your PR's title and assign the **do-not-merge** label. This will let people looking at your PR know that it is not well baked yet.\n\n### Developer Certificate of Origin: Signing your work\n\n#### Every commit needs to be signed\n\nThe Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/), reformatted for readability:\n```\nBy making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n\n    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or\n\n    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or\n\n    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.\n\n    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.\n```\n\nContributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages.\n\n```text\nThis is my commit message\n\nSigned-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>\n```\n\nGit even has a `-s` command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:\n\n```sh\ngit commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'\n```\n\nEach Pull Request is checked  whether or not commits in a Pull Request do contain a valid Signed-off-by line.\n\n#### I didn't sign my commit, now what?!\n\nNo worries - You can easily replay your changes, sign them and force push them!\n\n```sh\ngit checkout <branch-name>\ngit commit --amend --no-edit --signoff\ngit push --force-with-lease <remote-name> <branch-name>\n```\n\n### Use of Third-party code\n\n- Third-party code must include licenses.\n\n### Available GitHub Slash Commands\n\n- Available GitHub Slash Commands listed in [command-reference](https://docs.dapr.io/contributing/daprbot/#command-reference).\n\n**Thank You!** - Your contributions to open source, large or small, make projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dapr/community/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)"

If they are unresponsive for >3 months, they will be automatically removed unless a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) of the other project maintainers agrees to extend the period to be greater than 3 months.\n\nNew maintainers can be added to the project by a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) vote of the existing maintainers. A potential maintainer may be nominated by an existing maintainer. A vote is conducted in private between the current maintainers over the course of a one week voting period. At the end of the week, votes are counted and a pull request is made on the repo adding the new maintainer to the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file.\n\nA maintainer may step down by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/new) stating their intent.\n\nChanges to this governance document require a pull request with approval from a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) of the current maintainers.\n\n## Code of Conduct\nThis project has adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dapr/community/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)\n"

Each building block is independent and you can use one, some, or all of them in your application.\n\n![Dapr overview](./img/overview.png)\n\nWe are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project.\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kedacore/keda/main/images/logo-cncf.svg\" height=\"75px\"></p>\n\n## Goals\n\n- Enable developers using *any* language or framework to write distributed applications\n- Solve the hard problems developers face building microservice applications by providing best practice building blocks\n- Be community driven, open and vendor neutral\n- Gain new contributors\n- Provide consistency and portability through open APIs\n- Be platform agnostic across cloud and edge\n- Embrace extensibility and provide pluggable components without vendor lock-in\n- Enable IoT and edge scenarios by being highly performant and lightweight\n- Be incrementally adoptable from existing code, with no runtime dependency\n\n## How it works\n\nDapr injects a side-car (container or process) to each compute unit. The side-car interacts with event triggers and communicates with the compute unit via standard HTTP or gRPC protocols. This enables Dapr to support all existing and future programming languages without requiring you to import frameworks or libraries.\n\nDapr offers built-in state management, reliable messaging (at least once delivery), triggers and bindings through standard HTTP verbs or gRPC interfaces. This allows you to write stateless, stateful and actor-like services following the same programming paradigm. You can freely choose consistency model, threading model and message delivery patterns.\n\nDapr runs natively on Kubernetes, as a self hosted binary on your machine, on an IoT device, or as a container that can be injected into any system, in the cloud or on-premises.\n\nDapr uses pluggable component state stores and message buses such as Redis as well as gRPC to offer a wide range of communication methods, including direct dapr-to-dapr using gRPC and async Pub-Sub with guaranteed delivery and at-least-once semantics.\n\n\n## Why Dapr?\n\nWriting highly performant, scalable and reliable distributed application is hard. Dapr brings proven patterns and practices to you. It unifies event-driven and actors semantics into a simple, consistent programming model. It supports all programming languages without framework lock-in. You are not exposed to low-level primitives such as threading, concurrency control, partitioning and scaling. Instead, you can write your code by implementing a simple web server using familiar web frameworks of your choice.\n\nDapr is flexible in threading and state consistency models. You can leverage multi-threading if you choose to, and you can choose among different consistency models. This flexibility enables you to implement advanced scenarios without artificial constraints. Dapr is unique because you can transition seamlessly between platforms and underlying implementations without rewriting your code.\n\n## Features\n\n* Event-driven Pub-Sub system with pluggable providers and at-least-once semantics\n* Input and output bindings with pluggable providers\n* State management with pluggable data stores\n* Consistent service-to-service discovery and invocation\n* Opt-in stateful models: Strong/Eventual consistency, First-write/Last-write wins\n* Cross platform virtual actors\n* Secret management to retrieve secrets from secure key vaults\n* Rate limiting\n* Built-in [Observability](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/observability-concept/) support\n* Runs natively on Kubernetes using a dedicated Operator and CRDs\n* Supports all programming languages via HTTP and gRPC\n* Multi-Cloud, open components (bindings, pub-sub, state) from Azure, AWS, GCP\n* Runs anywhere, as a process or containerized\n* Lightweight (58MB binary, 4MB physical memory)\n* Runs as a sidecar - removes the need for special SDKs or libraries\n* Dedicated CLI - developer friendly experience with easy debugging\n* Clients for Java, .NET Core, Go, Javascript, Python, Rust and C++\n\n## Get Started using Dapr\n\nSee our [Getting Started](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/) guide over in our docs.\n\n## Quickstarts and Samples\n\n* See the [quickstarts repository](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts) for code examples that can help you get started with Dapr.\n* Explore additional samples in the Dapr [samples repository](https://github.com/dapr/samples).\n\n## Community\nWe want your contributions and suggestions!
