          "content": "# Development\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe Kubernetes Dashboard consists of a few main modules:\n\n- API — Stateless Go module, which could be referred to as a Kubernetes API extension. It provides functionalities like:\n  - Aggregation (i.e., returning metrics and events for pods)\n  - Sorting\n  - Filtering\n  - Pagination\n- Auth — Go module handling authentication to the Kubernetes API.  \n- Web — Module containing web application written in Angular and Go server with some web-related logic (i.e., settings). Its main task is presenting data fetched from Kubernetes API through API module.\n- Metrics Scraper — Go module used to scrape and store a small window of metrics fetched from the Kubernetes Metrics Server.\n\n## Code Conventions\n\nWhen writing new Go code, we try to follow conventions described in [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).  We are using [Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) to monitor how well we are doing.\n\nFor Angular, we try to follow conventions described in [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) and [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/).\n\nWe are running a set of checks for each pull request, all of them have to be successful before the change can be merged. You can run most of them locally using `make` targets, i.e. `make test` or `make check` (see [`Makefile`](Makefile) for more information).\n\nTools that we are using include [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint), [eslint](https://eslint.org), [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint), [prettier](https://prettier.io/).\n\n## Development Environment\n\nMake sure the following software is installed and added to your path:\n\n- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) \n- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (check the required version in [`modules/go.work`](modules/go.work))\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (check the required version in [`modules/web/package.json`](modules/web/package.json))\n- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (check the required version in [`modules/web/.yarnrc.yml`](modules/web/.yarnrc.yml))\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAfter cloning the repository, install web dependencies with `cd modules/web && yarn`.\n\nThen you can start the development version of the application with `make serve` It will create local kind cluster and run all the modules with Docker compose.\n\nIf you would like to run production version of the application use `make run`.\n\nTo run a full end-to-end test use `make helm`. It will:\n- spin up a local kind dev cluster and expose 443 port (make sure that this port is free on your host)\n- install ingress-nginx for kind\n- update local helm dependencies\n- build all production ready docker images\n- load built images into the kind dev cluster\n- install Kubernetes Dashboard via helm chart inside kind dev cluster\n\nKubernetes Dashboard should be then available directly on your localhost: https://localhost\n\nTo create Docker images locally use `make image`.\n\nSee [`Makefile`](Makefile) to get to know other targets useful during development. You can also run `make help` to quickly check the list of available commands.\n\n## Dependency Management\n\nWe keep all the dependencies outside the repository and always try to avoid using suspicious, unknown dependencies as they may introduce vulnerabilities.\n\nWe use [go mod](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage Go dependencies. We try to use only official releases, avoid using specific or latest commits. Before sending any changes we run `go mod tidy` to remove unused dependencies.\n\nWe use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage JavaScript dependencies. After checking out repository, run `yarn` to install all dependencies.\n\nAdditionally, we use [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to automate dependency updates.\n\n\n## Releases\n\nWe follow [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme for versioning releases of app and all of its modules.\n\nEach module described in the [Architecture section](#architecture) has its own releases and versions. After testing everything on a production version of application, i.e., using `make run`, new release can be created. For modules described above we create tag and the release with module name and its version in it, i.e.`api/v1.0.0` or `web/v2.4.5`. After a new tag is created, new images should be built by GitHub actions.\n\nWe also create application releases by releasing a new version of Helm chart that uses modules described before. After applying all the changes to the chart and testing it on a Kubernetes cluster a new tag and the release can be created. For application releases we put only the version in the tag and release name, i.e. `v3.0.0`. This release should include detailed description including release notes, compatibility matrix and all other important information.\n"

It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.\n\nAs of version 7.0.0, we have dropped support for Manifest-based installation. Only Helm-based installation is supported now. Due to multi-container setup and hard dependency on Kong gateway API proxy\nit would not be feasible to easily support Manifest-based installation.\n\nAdditionally, we have changed the versioning scheme and dropped `appVersion` from Helm chart. It is because, with a multi-container setup, every module is now versioned separately. Helm chart version\ncan be considered an app version now.\n\n![Dashboard UI workloads page](docs/images/overview.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nKubernetes Dashboard supports only Helm-based installation currently as it is faster and gives us better control\nover all dependencies required by Dashboard to run. We now use a single-container, DBless [Kong](https://hub.docker.com/r/kong/kong-gateway) installation\nas a gateway that connects all our containers and exposes the UI. Users can then use any ingress controller or proxy\nin front of kong gateway. To find out more about ways to customize your installation check out [helm chart values](charts/kubernetes-dashboard/values.yaml).\n\nIn order to install Kubernetes Dashboard simply run:\n```console\n# Add kubernetes-dashboard repository\nhelm repo add kubernetes-dashboard https://kubernetes.github.io/dashboard/\n# Deploy a Helm Release named \"kubernetes-dashboard\" using the kubernetes-dashboard chart\nhelm upgrade --install kubernetes-dashboard kubernetes-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard --create-namespace --namespace kubernetes-dashboard\n```\n\nFor more information about our Helm chart visit [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/k8s-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard).\n\n## Documentation\n\nDashboard documentation can be found in the [docs](docs/README.md) directory which contains:\n\n* [Common](docs/common/README.md): Entry-level overview.\n* [User Guide](docs/user/README.md): Helpful information for users.\n* [How to access Dashboard](docs/user/accessing-dashboard/README.md) - Everything you need to know to get access to you Kubernetes Dashboard instance after installation.\n* [Access Control](docs/user/access-control/README.md): Find out how to control access to your Kubernetes Dashboard and [create sample user](docs/user/access-control/creating-sample-user.md) that can be used to log in.\n* [Developer Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md): Important information for contributors that would like to test, run and work on Dashboard locally.\n\n## Community, discussion, contribution, and support\n\nLearn how to engage with the Kubernetes community on the [community page](http://kubernetes.io/community/).\n\nYou can reach the maintainers of this project at:\n\n* [**#sig-ui on Kubernetes Slack**](https://kubernetes.slack.com)\n* [**kubernetes-sig-ui mailing list** ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-ui)\n* [**Issue tracker**](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues)\n* [**SIG info**](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-ui)\n* [**Roles**](ROLES.md)\n\n### Contribution\n\nLearn how to start contributing to the [Contributing Guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nParticipation in the Kubernetes community is governed by the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n----\n_Copyright 2019 [The Kubernetes Dashboard Authors](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/graphs/contributors)_\n"
