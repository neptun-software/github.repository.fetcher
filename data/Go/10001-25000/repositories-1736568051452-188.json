Bitbucket Cloud requires a specific auth format for Git operations using tokens, where the username must be 'x-token-auth'. This fixes token authentication for Bitbucket while maintaining compatibility with other Git providers like GitHub and GitLab, and Azure by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8778\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.13.7 - 2024-10-31\n\n\n### Added\n- New `expect` arg for `Container.withExec` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8466 \\\n  This enum arg allows specifying valid return statuses for which the command\n  can return without failing immediately.\n- New `Container.exitCode` field to get the exit code of the last `withExec` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8466\n\n### Changed\n- Updated default cache policies to avoid consuming too much disk by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8725 \\\n  The new policies attempt to co-operate with other applications using the disk\n  and will adjust its cache usage accordingly.\n- cli: limit printing objects to state by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8788 \\\n  Previously, when a function chain in `dagger call` ended in an object, we'd\n  print all functions that return a simple value and don't have any arguments.\n  Now, only object fields will be included, not all functions.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix excessive cache invalidation of `withExec`s using the `ExperimentalPrivilegedNesting` flag by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8776\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.13.6 - 2024-10-24\n\n\n### Added\n- Show metrics for execs in TUI by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8506 \\\n  The engine now supports collecting metrics from individual execs and publishing them as OTel metrics.\n\n  To start, just disk read/write byte totals and CPU/IO pressure time are supported, but more like memory/network/etc, will be added soon.\n\n  Currently, metrics will be displayed in the TUI at verbosity level 4 (`-vvv`).\n\n### Changed\n- `dagger init` defaults to use `.dagger` folder during if current directory `.` is not empty by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8557\n- `dagger install` now preserves the original source input, and tracks a separate `pin` field for the exact remote commit by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8587\n\n### Fixed\n- Allow custom enums that include ambiguous names (such as `true`/`false`) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8682\n- Optimize `Container.from` for image refs with digests by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8736 \\\n  Previously, if `Container.from` was given an image ref with a digest and that image already existed in the local cache, the engine would still waste time resolving metadata over the network from the registry.\n\n  Now, if a digested image ref already exists locally, the network requests are skipped entirely.\n- Allow cloning hidden commits that are not fetched as part of a normal clone by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8747 \\\n  For example, `refs/pull/<pr>/head`, or `refs/pull/<pr>/merge`.\n- Speed up fully cached initialize time by caching more internal SDK operations by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8735 \\\n  Dagger wasn't caching as many SDK operations as it could. With this change Dagger's own CI modules initialize ~1s faster when fully cached.\n- Speed up initialization of modules with lots of dependencies using the Go SDK in engines with no cache by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8761 \\\n  Various dependencies of Go SDK modules are now pre-cached in the engine image, which avoids significant CPU pressure when building Go SDK modules in parallel with no cache.\n\n  The engine image size increase is expected to be offset by these improvements.\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.13.5 - 2024-10-10\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix `MarshalJSON` error in `git` API when called by older module versions by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8667\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.13.4 - 2024-10-09\n\n\n### 🔥 Breaking Changes\n- Changed behavior of Git to default keep the `.git` directory by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8318 \\\n  This can be disabled with `tree`'s new `discardGitDir` option. Modules with\n  older `engineVersion`s will keep the old behavior.\n- Deprecated `git`'s `keepGitDir` argument by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8318\n\n### Added\n- Services can now be given an explicit hostname via `Service.withHostname` by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8641 \\\n  Previously, you could only express a DAG of services, because each service\n  hostname was derived from the service's configuration, and changing a service\n  to point to another service would inherently change that service's\n  configuration.\n\n  Now you can set your own hostnames ahead of time, tell your services about\n  each other's hostnames, and start they manually.\n\n  Services with custom hostnames are namespaced to the module that starts them, to prevent conflicts.\n- Allow expanding environment variables in more `Container` functions by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8427\n- Apply `ignore` function parameter metadata on Directory passed from the CLI by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8436 \\\n  This extends the usage of `ignore` to not only dir loaded with `defaultPath`\n  but directory passed as function's param from the CLI.\n\n  Note: ignore patterns are not applied for module to module calls.\n- Enabled `Container.withMountedTemp` size configuration by @cwlbraa in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8652\n- Add `noInit` option to `Container.withExec` to support disabling automatic init process by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8656 \\\n  Use cases that strictly require the user exec is PID 1 of the container are\n  now supported by setting `noInit` to true.\n\n### Fixed\n- Include container annotations on `Export` and `AsTarball` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8543\n- Correctly resolve relative path for modules fetched from git by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8565\n- Fix include/exclude patterns from a dependency incorrectly affecting a parent module by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8575\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.13.3 - 2024-09-20\n\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed version nag showing up even when up-to-date by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8521\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.13.2 - 2024-09-20\n\n\n### Added\n- New `Container.up` API by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8479 \\\n  This is an alias to `.AsService().Up()`.\n\n### Fixed\n- removed noisy \"check for updates\" span by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8491\n- fix log output having extra blank lines by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8500\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.13.1 -

2024-08-29\n\n\n### Added\n- Add new context directory support by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7744 \\\n  This allows accessing their own source directory, without needing to\n  explicitly pass directories around.\n- Support private modules with new SSH ref scheme and forward of SSH agent by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7708\n  - Go-like public module refs (currently used) remain active\n  - HTTP / HTTPS schemes are now supported as alternative public module refs\n  - SSH refs are introduced, with support of SCP-like refs git@provider:user/repo and explicit ssh://provider/user/repo\n- Implements CLI call argument `--interactive-command` for overriding the default command used in interactive mode by @samalba in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8171\n\n### Fixed\n- Error out if non-existent local module directory is passed to CLI by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8193 \\\n  The file-not-found errors were previously silently ignored for the top-level\n  module passed in the CLI.\n- Silence noisy `failed to get repo HEAD` CLI error by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8189\n- Fix performance issues in `Container.withExec` after using `withMountedTemp` or `withMountedSecret` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8180\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.12.5 - 2024-08-15\n\n\n### Added\n- cli: allow calling core functions directly by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7310 \\\n  Usage: `dagger core <function>` \\\n  Example: `dagger core container from --address=alpine terminal`\n\n  Works the same as `dagger call`, but instead of loading a user module,\n  it only uses functions from the core API.\n\n  Run `dagger core --help` for available functions.\n\n  _Note that this command is experimental and the DX for calling core functions\n  in the CLI may change in the future._\n- New SDK aliases for `elixir` and `php` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8067 \\\n  SDKs with experimental module support (elixir and php) can now be accessed\n  using `--sdk=<sdk>` (such as `--sdk=elixir` and `--sdk=php` respectively)\n  instead of the full form\n  `--sdk=github.com/dagger/dagger/sdk/<sdk>@<version>`.\n- Add `File.digest` method by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8114 \\\n  This method provides an efficient way to compute a file's digest, which\n  unlock optimized file comparison or check for file changes.\n- Bundle CLI in the Engine image so that both parts of Dagger (CLI+Engine) ship as a single artefact by @gerhard in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8147\n\n### Changed\n- Reimplemented the OpenTelemetry data pipeline to avoid hangs and other complications by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7996\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix `Directory.glob` to correctly handle globs with subdir prefixes by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8110 \\\n  Previously, attempting to glob with a prefix subdir in a pattern like\n  `<subdir>/*` would not match any files. This should now be fixed, and files\n  in `<subdir>` will now be correctly matched.\n- Fix `failed to collect IDs from parent fields` error when module objects contain fields with nil values by @jedevc/@sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8132\n- Fixed enum lists in modules by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8096\n- Fixed referring to module's own objects/interfaces/enums in constructor signature by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8115 \\\n  Previously, modules would fail to launch if they declared a constructor that\n  contained a reference to a type from it's own module in it's args.\n- Fixed using custom enum types as optional arguments by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8148 \\\n  Previously, function calls that defined an optional argument would not be\n  callable.\n- Make retrieving secret from command works on Windows by @wingyplus in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8121\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.12.4 - 2024-08-01\n\n\n### Changed\n- Deprecate old `pipeline` APIs by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8064 \\\n  These operations have been no-ops since v0.11.0, and will be removed in v0.13.0.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix errors when using Dockerfile builds from module functions that have secrets by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8049\n- Fix dagger `terminal` prompt with debian-based images by @vmaffet in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7960\n- Fix occasional leaks in secret scrubbing algorithm by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8047\n- Fix frequent context switches in `--progress=plain` output by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7956\n- Extend multi git server support to Azure devOps by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8063 \\\n  Our support for Azure refs was broken on monorepos. We special-case Azure\n  DevOps since it doesn't work with the go standard convention of discovering\n  the root of a git repository\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.12.3 - 2024-07-25\n\n\n### Added\n- cli: propagate exit code from function by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8019\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix rare condition in which clients could use wrong files in filesync by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7900\n- Fix missing secret errors when secrets are set in objects fields during chained function calls by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8011\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.12.2 - 2024-07-22\n\n\n### Changed\n- `dagger init` now generates files in the current directory by default and no longer in `./dagger` by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7824\n\n### Fixed\n- cli: fix handling of enum default values by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8000\n- cli: fix Cloud traces and GitHub checks always being succeeded by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8001\n  - note: this only affects telemetry; the command itself still fails.\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.12.1 - 2024-07-18\n\n\n### Added\n- cli: add support for passing `Socket`s as arguments from the CLI to Functions by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7804\n- cli: new `--compat` flag for develop to target a specific api version by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7948\n\n### Changed\n- cloud: traces are not uploaded for `dagger version`/`dagger login`/`dagger logout`/etc by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7928\n\n### Fixed\n- core: allow `@` in local module name by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7891\n- cli: fix `dagger version` sometimes disappearing by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7919\n- cli: avoid api errors when calling modules in compat mode by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7924\n\n### What to do next?\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.12.0 - 2024-07-12\n\nThis release is significant. All details (including videos & code examples)\nare captured [in this blog post](https://dagger.io/blog/dagger-0-12).\n\n### 🔥 Breaking Changes\n\n- sdk: Various breaking changes to the Go SDK \\\n  See the SDK-specific release notes for more information.\n- api: Align `Container.withNewFile` signature with `Directory.withNewFile` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7293 \\\n  Callers of `Container.withNewFile` will need to change `contents` from optional to required argument.\n- api: Skip entrypoint by default in `withExec` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7136 \\\n  Callers relying on a `Container`'s entrypoint will need to be updated\n  to opt-in with `useEntrypoint`.\n- api: Don't fallback to the default command on `Container.stdout` and `Container.stderr` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7857 \\\n  Callers of `stdout` and `stderr` without a previous `withExec` will need to\n  insert an explicit empty `withExec`.\n- api: `Container.terminal` now returns a `Container` by @aluzzardi in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7586 \\\n  Callers of `terminal` will need be updated to handle the updated type.\n- api: Return absolute path on export instead of boolean by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7500 \\\n  Callers expecting a boolean return will need to be updated to instead\n  handle a string path.\n- api: Removed deprecated `sshAuthSocket` and `sshKnownHosts` args from `GitRef.tree` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/6934 \\\n  Callers should instead attach these arguments onto the top-level `git` call.\n- api: Removed `id` parameters for `container`, `directory` and `socket` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/6934 \\\n  Users of these parameters should instead use the standalone\n  `loadContainerFromID`, `loadDirectoryFromID` and `loadSocketFromID`\n  respectively.\n- api: Removed `checkVersionCompatibility` field (versioning checks are now automatically performed on all connections) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7751 \\\n  Versioning checks are now all automatically performed on all connections, and\n  never need to be manually performed through the API.\n\n#### Upgrade Instructions\n\nThanks to the new compatibility mode feature, these breaking changes should not\nimpact any existing Modules immediately. `dagger call` should still work on\nv0.12.0 without any changes to your Module code (any compat issues for modules\nare likely a bug, please report!)\n\nAfter upgrading to Engine v0.12.0, you can upgrade your Module to use the\nlatest v0.12.0 APIs by running `dagger develop`. That will update the\n`engineVersion` field of your module's `dagger.json` configuration file to\n`v0.12.0` and enable the new APIs.\n\nAfter that, if your code is impacted by any of the breaking changes, you will\nsee errors when running `dagger call`. Once the errors are fixed, `dagger call`\nwill work again and your module can be updated in Daggerverse if desired.\n\nMore detailed instructions on addressing the individual API incompatible\nchanges can be found in the PR descriptions linked above.\n\n### Added\n\n- api: `terminal` can be inserted into the middle of `Container` and `Directory` pipelines to pop an interactive shell by @aluzzardi in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7586\n- api: Introduced module versioning compatibility by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7759\n- tui: Improved progress navigation and verbosity settings by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7671\n- cli: Add `-q` flag and `DAGGER_QUIET=1` to restore previous verbosity default by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7822\n- cli: Expand tilde (`~`) in file, directory and secret file argument by @wingyplus in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7818\n- api: Add git tags API by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7742\n- api: Add core APIs for local cache state by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7767\n\n### Changed\n\n- cli: Print module object fields with `dagger call` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7479\n\n### Fixed\n\n- cli: Allow absolute paths for local module paths by @Michael Albers in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7476\n- cli: Generate `LICENSE` only if `--sdk` is set on `dagger develop` by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7719\n- core: Correctly set new engine gc policy defaults by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7749\n- tui: plain progress output updated to not use hyperlinks by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7754\n- core: Prevent service healthchecks from using too long a retry interval by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7848\n\n### What to do next?\n\n- Read the [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io)\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n\n## v0.11.9 -

          "content": "The best way to find a good contribution is to use Dagger for something. Then write down what problems you encounter.\nCould be as simple as a question you had, that the docs didn't answer. Or a bug in the tool, or a missing feature.\nThen pick an item that you're comfortable with in terms of difficulty, and give it a try. 🙂\n\nYou can ask questions along the way, we're always happy to help you with your contribution. The bigger the contribution,\nthe earlier you should talk to maintainers to make sure you're taking the right approach and are not wasting your effort\non something that will not get merged.\n\n## Building/Running/Testing\n\nFor more detailed instructions on building, running and testing dagger locally,\nsee the dagger [dev module](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/main/dagger.json).\n\nWorking on dagger requires dagger to bootstrap it - you can install dagger\nusing the instructions at [https://docs.dagger.io/install](https://docs.dagger.io/install).\nBecause we dogfood all of our tooling ourselves, we recommend using the *most\nrecent* version of dagger to build (you can find the exact version used in our\nci by looking in `go.mod`).\n\n## GitHub Workflow\n\nThe recommended workflow is to fork the repository and open pull requests from your fork.\n\n### 1. Fork, clone & configure Dagger upstream\n\n- Click on the _Fork_ button on GitHub\n- Clone your fork\n- Add the upstream repository as a new remote\n\n```shell\n# Clone repository\ngit clone git@github.com:$YOUR_GITHUB_USER/dagger.git\n\n# Add upstream origin\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:dagger/dagger.git\n```\n\n### 2. Create a pull request\n\n```shell\n# Create a new feature branch\ngit checkout -b my_feature_branch\n\n# Make changes to your branch\n# ...\n\n# Commit changes - remember to sign!\ngit commit -s\n\n# Push your new feature branch\ngit push my_feature_branch\n\n# Create a new pull request from https://github.com/dagger/dagger\n```\n\n### 3. Add release notes fragment\n\nIf this is a user-facing change, please add a line for the release notes.\nYou will need to have [`changie` installed](https://changie.dev/guide/installation/).\n\nIf this is a user-facing change in the 🚙 Engine or 🚗 CLI, run `changie new` in the top level directory.\nHere is an example of what that looks like:\n\n```shell\nchangie new\n✔ Kind … Added\n✔ Body … engine: add `Directory.Sync`\n✔ GitHub PR … 5414\n✔ GitHub Author … helderco\n```\n\nIf there are code changes in the SDKs, run `changie new` in the corresponding directory, e.g. `sdk/go`, `sdk/typescript`, etc.\n\nRemember to add & commit the release notes fragment.\nThis will be used at release time, in the changelog.\nHere is an example of the end-result for all release notes fragments: [https://github.com/dagger/dagger/blob/v0.6.4/.changes/v0.6.4.md](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/blob/v0.6.4/.changes/v0.6.4.md)\n\nYou can find an asciinema of how `changie` works on [https://changie.dev](https://changie.dev)\n\n### 4. Update your pull request with latest changes\n\n```shell\n# Checkout main branch\ngit checkout main\n\n# Update your fork's main branch from upstream\ngit pull upstream main\n\n# Checkout your feature branch\ngit checkout my_feature_branch\n\n# Rebase your feature branch changes on top of the updated main branch\ngit rebase main\n\n# Update your pull request with latest changes\ngit push -f my_feature_branch\n```\n\n## Scope of pull requests\n\nWe prefer small incremental changes that can be reviewed and merged quickly.\nIt's OK if it takes multiple pull requests to close an issue.\n\nThe idea is that each improvement should land in Dagger's main branch within a\nfew hours. The sooner we can get multiple people looking at and agreeing on a\nspecific change, the quicker we will have it out in a release. The quicker we\ncan get these small improvementes in a Dagger release, the quicker we can get\nfeedback from our users and find out what doesn't work, or what we have missed.\n\nThe added benefit is that this will force everyone to think about handling\npartially implemented features & non-breaking changes. Both are great\napproaches, and they work really well in the context of Dagger.\n\n[\"Small incremental changes ftw\"](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/1348#issuecomment-1009628531) -> Small pull requests that get merged within hours!\n\n## Commits\n\n### License\n\nContributions to this project are made under the Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0).\n\n### DCO\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Developer Certificate of\nOrigin (DCO).\n\nAll commit messages must contain the Signed-off-by line with an email address\nthat matches the commit author. When committing, use the `--signoff` flag:\n\n```shell\ngit commit -s\n```\n\nThe Signed-off-by line must match the **author's real name**, otherwise the PR will be rejected.\n\n### Commit messages\n\n:::tip\n[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\n:::\n\nGuidelines:\n\n- **Group Commits:** Each commit should represent a meaningful change (e.g. implement feature X, fix bug Y, ...).\n  - For instance, a PR should not look like _1) Add Feature X 2) Fix Typo 3) Changes to features X 5) Bugfix for feature X 6) Fix Linter 7)_ ...\n  - Instead, these commits should be squashed together into a single \"Add Feature\" commit.\n- Each commit should work on its own: it must compile, pass the linter and so on.\n  - This makes life much easier when using `git log`, `git blame`, `git bisect`, etc.\n  - For instance, when doing a `git blame` on a file to figure out why a change\n    was introduced, it's pretty meaningless to see a _Fix linter_ commit message.\n    \"Add Feature X\" is much more meaningful.\n- Use `git rebase -i main` to group commits together and rewrite their commit message.\n- To add changes to the previous commit, use `git commit --amend -s`. This will\n  change the last commit (amend) instead of creating a new commit.\n- Format: Use the imperative mood in the subject line: \"If applied, this commit\n  will _your subject line here_\"\n- Add the following prefixes to your commit message to help trigger automated processes[^1]:\n  - `docs:` for documentation changes only (e.g., `docs: Fix typo in X`);\n  - `test:` for changes to tests only (e.g., `test: Check if X does Y`);\n  - `chore:` general things that should be excluded (e.g., `chore: Clean up X`);\n  - `website:` for the documentation website (i.e., the frontend code; e.g., `website: Add X link to navbar`);\n  - `ci:` for internal CI specific changes (e.g., `ci: Enable X for tests`);\n  - `infra:` for infrastructure changes (e.g., `infra: Enable cloudfront for X`);\n  - `fix`: for improvements and bugfixes that do not introduce a feature (e.g., `fix: improve error message`);\n  - `feat`: for new features (e.g., `feat: implement --cache-to feature to export cache`)\n\n[^1]: See [https://www.conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)\n\n## Docs\n\n### Use relative file paths for links\n\nInstead of using URLs to link to a doc page, use relative file paths instead:\n\n```markdown\n❌ This is [a problematic link](/doc-url).\n\n✅ This is [a good link](../relative-doc-file-path.md).\n```\n\nThe docs compiler will replace file links with URLs automatically. This helps\nprevent broken internal links. If a file gets renamed, the compiler will catch\nbroken links and throw an error. [Learn\nmore](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/links).\n\n## Vulnerability Scanning\n\nWe run trivy scanning of our engine image in GHA to scan for any CVEs present in any third-party binaries we build or that we include in the image (e.g. runc, CNI plugins, etc.). As of this writing, we currently only scan for Critical and High severity CVEs. If any of those are found the GHA job will fail.\n\nIt's sometimes possible that the vulnerability may require quite a bit of work to address, especially if it's coming from third-party binary or a transitive dependency in our go.mod that does not have a release with the fix yet.\n\n- In this case, it's worth checking whether the specific vulnerability is actually relevant to us. If it's not or if you're unsure, reach out to the Dagger team on Github or Discord and we can figure out whether to address it or add it to an ignore list.\n\nThe rest of this section gives some guidance on fixing these vulnerabilities when they are relevant.\n\n### Vulnerability in a Dagger binary\n\nIf a vulnerability is reported in the Go stdlib, we'll want to upgrade the version of Go we use to build everything. As of this writing, this can be done by changing `GolangVersion` in `.dagger/consts/versions.go`.\n\nOtherwise, if a vulnerability is reported in a Go dependency, you'll want to track down where the dependency is coming from.\n\nThis can become a bit complicated since it's possible for multiple versions of a Go module to be in the dependency DAG, with only a subset of the versions actually being vulnerable.\n\n1. If the dependency at the vulnerable version is directly listed in our `go.mod`, then you should start by just upgrading it there.\n1. After that, if the vulnerability is still reported, it may be coming from a transitive dependency.\n   - You can track those down with the `go mod graph` command. For example, if the vulnerable module version is `golang.org/x/sys@v0.0.0-20211116061358-0a5406a5449c`, you can run `go mod graph | grep 'golang.org/x/sys@v0.0.0-20211116061358-0a5406a5449c'`.\n\n### Vulnerability in a third-party binary\n\nIf a vulnerability is reported in the Go stdlib, we'll want to upgrade the version of Go we use to build everything. As of this writing, this can be done by changing `GolangVersion` in `.dagger/consts/versions.go`.\n\nOtherwise, you'll want to check if the binary in question has a newer version with the vulnerability gone. The versions of these binaries are also controlled in `.dagger/consts/versions.go`.\n\nIf there isn't a newer version to upgrade to, we'll be in a tougher spot and may need some combination of upgrading to a non-released commit, sending patches upstream or (as a worst-case fallback) patching it ourselves. Reach out to the Dagger team on Github or Discord if you're unsure how to best proceed.\n\n### How to test SDK changes locally?\n\nTypeScript:\n\n- In `sdk/typescript`, run `npm run build`\n- In your `package.json`, update `@dagger.io/dagger` to reference your local path. For example `\"@dagger.io/dagger\": \"<PATH TO DAGGER FORK>/dagger/sdk/typescript\",`\n\nPython:\n\n- While in a VirtualEnvironment, run `pip install <PATH TO DAGGER FORK>/sdk/python`\n\nGo:\n\n- In your Go project, run `go mod edit -replace dagger.io/dagger=<PATH TO DAGGER FORK>/sdk/go`\n- Then `go mod tidy`\n"

Run your functions from the CLI, your language interpreter, or a custom HTTP client\n4. Package your functions into a module, to reuse in your next project or share with the community\n5. Search the Daggerverse for existing modules, and import them into yours. All Dagger modules can reuse each other's functions - across language.\n\n## Benefits to app teams\n\n* Reduce complexity: even complex builds can be expressed as a few simple functions\n* No more \"push and pray\": everything CI can do, your dev environment can do too\n* Use the same language to develop your app and its scripts\n* Easy onboarding of new developers: if you can build, test and deploy - they can too.\n* Everything is cached by default: expect 2x to 10x speedups\n* Parity between dev and CI environments\n* Cross-team collaboration: reuse another team's workflows without learning their stack\n\n## Benefits to platform teams\n\n* Reduce CI lock-in. Dagger functions run on all major CI platforms - no proprietary DSL needed.\n* Don't be a bottleneck. Let app teams write their own functions. Enable standardization by providing them a library of reusable components.\n* Faster CI runs. CI pipelines that are \"Daggerized\" typically run 2x to 10x faster, thanks to caching and concurrency. This means developers waste less time waiting for CI, and you spend less money on CI compute.\n* A viable platform strategy. App teams need flexibility, and you need control. Dagger gives you a way to reconcile the two, in an incremental way that leverages the stack you already have.\n\n## Learn more\n\n* [How does it work?](https://docs.dagger.io/#how-does-dagger-work)\n* [Quickstart](https://docs.dagger.io/quickstart)\n* [Cookbook](https://docs.dagger.io/cookbook)\n\n## Join the community\n\n* Join the [Dagger community server](https://discord.gg/ufnyBtc8uY)\n* Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dagger_io)\n* Check out our [community activities](https://dagger.io/community)\n* Read more in our [documentation](https://docs.dagger.io)\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing or building dagger from scratch?

The first step is to let the team know what is going to happen,\npreferably a few days in advance so that they can react. We do our release\nthreads in public wherever possible, to give the community more visibility, and\nto help external contributors to more easily keep in sync with the release\ncadence.\n\nTo let the team know:\n\n- [ ] Create a new milestone in [GitHub](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/milestones),\n      e.g. [`v0.11.5 Milestone`](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/milestone/47)\n- [ ] Create a new post in [Discord #engine-dev](https://discord.com/channels/707636530424053791/1003718839739105300),\n      e.g. [`v0.11.5 release - 28th May 2024`](https://discord.com/channels/707636530424053791/1240714480275689574)\n\nThis allows others to weigh in whether:\n\n- we should go for a patch / minor bump\n- there are any PRs that people are waiting to get merged\n- any big features which need to remain experimental?\n- etc.\n\nMaybe there are breaking changes which we should be aware of and message\naccordingly. Giving other team members a day or two to react - because\ntimezones! - will make this entire process smoother.\n\nMost importantly, patch vs minor is **not** a technical decision. If you want\nto read more about this, see [this (private) Discord\nthread](https://discord.com/channels/707636530424053791/1101242942267601038/1101508879671623780).\n\n- [ ] If doing a minor release, determine if there are any deprecations that\n      can be removed.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Once you know what type of release we are producing - patch vs minor -\n> remember to edit the `?` in the Discord thread.\n\n### Backwards compatibility\n\nWhere possible, we try to ensure backwards compatibility between mismatched cli\nand engine versions. However, for technical reasons, this isn't always possible:\nsometime the communication protocol changes, or a bug fix or new feature\nrequires changes on both the CLI and the engine.\n\nBefore releasing, make sure to sanity check the backwards compatibility of a\nrelease. If you enounter issues, then:\n\n- [ ] Add a release note using `changie new` (or add it later manually).\n- [ ] Bump the minimum version numbers in [engine/version.go](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/blob/main/engine/version.go).\n\nIf unsure, bump both the client and engine minimum version numbers, but if\nthe backwards compatibility is only an issue in one direction, you only need\nto bump that one.\n\n## Improve this doc while releasing 改善\n\nIn order to keep this relevant & accurate, we improve this doc during the\nrelease process. It's the best time to pause, observe how it all fits together,\nand improve it. We want small, constant improvements which compound. Therefore:\n\n- [ ] Save a copy of this doc outside of this repository (e.g.\n      `~/Downloads/RELEASING.md`). Now open that copy in your editor and start\n      ticking items off it as you make progress. Remember to add / remove / edit\n      any parts which could be improved. As inspiration, [see what a past PR with\n      improvements looks like](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/5056).\n- [ ] Update the date in the shields.io badge, first line in this file.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> We believe in documentation first, automation second. Documenting a process\n> forces us to understand it well. Continuously editing this documentation\n> refines our understanding. Once we have a good grasp of the problem space,\n> and reach an elegant solution, it comes natural to automate & speed things\n> up, to make the process more efficient. We should still be able to perform\n> things manually if we need to - because sometimes automation fails 🤷. This\n> is when everyone wishes they had good documentation, the original author(s)\n> or both! It's also worth mentioning that when it's time to improve this\n> automation, we want to be looking at the blueprint - this doc right here -\n> not the implementation. If you ever had to migrate from Chef/Puppet to\n> Ansible/Terraform, you know what it was like to migrate the implementation.\n\n## Workflow for releases off non-main branch\n\nCurrently, some of the steps here vary depending on whether we are running a\nrelease off of `main` vs. off of a separate branch.\n\nThey are marked with 🚨 in the steps below.\n\nWe do this process when we need to do a patch release but don't want to include\nevery commit that has been merged to `main` since the last release.\n\nIn the long term we should strive to make the process the same regardless of\nthe branch we are releasing off of, but for now, we need to be aware of the\ndifferences.\n\n## Required tooling\n\nBefore starting the releasing process, make sure you have your local\nenvironment setup and ready to go. You'll need (at least) the following tools -\nthough you probably already have most of them if you're regularly contributing\nto dagger.\n\n- A UNIX environment and shell\n- [git](https://git-scm.com/)\n- [dagger](https://github.com/dagger/dagger) (the most recent release)\n- [changie](https://changie.dev)\n- [gh](https://cli.github.com/) github cli tool\n- [golang](https://go.dev)\n\n## 📝 Preparation ⏱ `30mins`\n\nSetup some variables used throughout the release process:\n\n```console\n# 🚨 change this from `main` to `release-vX.Y.Z` if releasing off a non-main branch\nexport RELEASE_BRANCH=main\n\n# If not named \"origin\" in your local checkout, replace \"origin\" with whatever the\n# github.com/dagger/dagger repo is named for you locally\nexport DAGGER_REPO_REMOTE=origin\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This process involves direct pushes to the github.com/dagger/dagger repository. Recently there have been permission issues here that result in errors like\n>\n> `refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow` when pushing.\n>\n> If you encounter this, you may need to change your git remote from https to ssh, e.g.\n>\n> `git remote set-url $DAGGER_REPO_REMOTE git@github.com:dagger/dagger.git`\n>\n> It's advisable to go back to https after the release is complete to not retain excessive permissions longer than necessary, e.g. to go back run\n>\n> `git remote set-url $DAGGER_REPO_REMOTE https://github.com/dagger/dagger.git`\n\n<details>\n<summary>🚨 Non-main branch release only:</summary>\n\nCreate a new branch off of the previous git tag being patched named `release-vX.Y.Z` (e.g. `release-v0.11.9`)\n\n```console\ngit switch -c $RELEASE_BRANCH\n\n# e.g. if creating a new v0.11.9 release off of v0.11.8, use v0.11.8 here\ngit reset --hard <previous tag being patched>\n\ngit push --set-upstream $DAGGER_REPO_REMOTE \"$RELEASE_BRANCH\"\n```\n\n</details>\n\nSetup the local branch to align with the remote branch being released\n\n```console\ngit checkout \"$RELEASE_BRANCH\"\n\ngit pull $DAGGER_REPO_REMOTE \"$RELEASE_BRANCH\"\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>🚨 Non-main branch release only:</summary>\n\n`git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` the commits you want to include in the release from `main` to the release branch.\n\nYou will also want to ensure you _always_ cherry-pick a few special commits:\n\n- [ ] The SDK bump PR for the release being patched.\n  - e.g. if we are creating a `v0.11.9` release based off of `v0.11.8`, you want to ensure you cherry-pick [this PR](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7690).\n- [ ] The PR that bumps CI to use the new Engine version.\n  - e.g. if we are creating a `v0.11.9` release based off of `v0.11.8`, you want to ensure you cherry-pick [this PR](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7702) that upgrades CI to use `v0.11.8` engines.\n\n</details>\n\n- [ ] Determine the next release version (use `patch`/`minor`/`major` to set the release type):\n\n```console\nexport ENGINE_VERSION_TYPE=patch\nexport ENGINE_VERSION=\"$(changie next $ENGINE_VERSION_TYPE)\"\n\n# this is required to interpolate $ENGINE_VERSION to the SDK release notes\nexport CHANGIE_ENGINE_VERSION=\"$ENGINE_VERSION\"\n```\n\n- [ ] Ensure that `.changes/.next` contains `$ENGINE_VERSION` - if it doesn't,\n      update it now!\n\n- [ ] Create the target release notes branch for a PR - e.g. `prep-v0.12.4`.\n  - 🚨 Non-main branch release only: This PR will also include the cherry-picked commits mentioned above.\n\n```console\ngit checkout -b prep-$ENGINE_VERSION\n```\n\n- [ ] Bump internal versions (sdks + docs + helm chart) to the target version\n\n```console\ndagger call release bump --version=\"$ENGINE_VERSION\" -o ./\ngit add docs sdk helm\ngit commit -s -m \"chore: bump dependencies to $ENGINE_VERSION\"\n```\n\n- [ ] Push to `dagger/dagger` - we need access to secrets that PRs coming from forks will not have. Open the PR as a draft and capture the PR number:\n\n```console\ngh pr create --draft --title \"chore: prep for $ENGINE_VERSION\" --body \"\" | tee /tmp/prep-pr.txt\nexport RELEASE_PREP_PR=$(cat /tmp/prep-pr.txt | sed -r 's/^[^0-9]*([0-9]+).*/\\1/')\n```\n\n- [ ] Generate bump changes for each SDK + the helm charts\n\n```console\nexport GITHUB_USERNAME=$(gh api /user --jq .login)\nfind sdk/go sdk/python sdk/typescript sdk/elixir sdk/php sdk/rust helm/dagger -maxdepth 1 -name .changie.yaml -execdir \\\n      changie new --kind \"Dependencies\" --body \"Bump Engine to $ENGINE_VERSION\" --custom PR=\"$RELEASE_PREP_PR\" --custom Author=\"$GITHUB_USERNAME\" \\;\n```\n\n- [ ] Generate release notes `.changes/**/v0.12.4.md` for all releases by\n      running `changie batch $ENGINE_VERSION`:\n\n```console\nfind . sdk/go sdk/python sdk/typescript sdk/elixir sdk/php sdk/rust helm/dagger -maxdepth 1 -name .changie.yaml -execdir changie batch $ENGINE_VERSION \\;\n```\n\n- [ ] Make any necessary edits to the newly generated file, e.g. `.changes/v0.12.4.md`\n- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` by running `changie merge`.\n\n```console\nfind . sdk/go sdk/python sdk/typescript sdk/elixir sdk/php sdk/rust helm/dagger -maxdepth 1 -name .changie.yaml -execdir changie merge \\;\ngit add **/.changes\ngit add **/CHANGELOG.md\ngit commit -s -m \"chore: add release notes for $ENGINE_VERSION\"\n```\n\n- [ ] Update `.changes/.next` with the next release number if known -\n      otherwise, make the file empty (but don't remove it).\n\n- [ ] Bring the prep PR out of draft:\n\n```console\ngh pr ready\n```\n\n- [ ] `30 mins` Review and merge the prep PR. The merged commit is what gets tagged in the next step.\n  - 🚨 Non-main branch release only: Ideally use \"Rebase and Merge\" rather than squashing commits when merging so we can more easily preserve the history of the cherry-picked commits.\n\n- [ ] Ensure that all GitHub Actions checks pass for the dagger.io PR which\n      gets automatically created part of this PR. The PR is configured to deploy a\n      Daggerverse preview environment with a `main` Dagger Engine (the one that is\n      just about to be released). If all checks pass, close that PR & delete the\n      branch (this will clean up the infra that gets provisioned). If checks fail, cc\n      @jpadams @marcosnils @matipan @gerhard in the release thread and wait for a\n      response before continuing with the release (this might be a blocker).\n\n- [ ] `15 mins` Confirm that all checks on `$RELEASE_BRANCH` are green, for main you're basically [checking](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/commits/main/) that the merged prep commit is has a green check.\n      Do not push tags until this is finished.\n\n## 🚀 Release ⏱ `10mins`\n\n- [ ] When you have confirmed that all checks on `$RELEASE_BRANCH` are green, run the following:\n\n```console\ngit checkout \"$RELEASE_BRANCH\"\ngit pull \"$DAGGER_REPO_REMOTE\" \"$RELEASE_BRANCH\"\n\nexport ENGINE_GIT_SHA=\"$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD)\"\ngit tag \"$ENGINE_VERSION\" \"$ENGINE_GIT_SHA\"\ngit push \"$DAGGER_REPO_REMOTE\" \"$ENGINE_VERSION\"\n```\n\nThis will kick off [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/actions/workflows/publish.yml) which publishes:\n\n- A new image to [ghcr.io/dagger/engine](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pkgs/container/engine) (mirrored to registry.dagger.io/engine using https://github.com/dagger/registry-redirect).\n- New cli binaries to [dl.dagger.io](https://dl.dagger.io) (served from an S3 bucket, uploaded to by goreleaser)\n- New docs to [docs.dagger.io](https://docs.dagger.io) (served from netlify)\n- Go packages to [🐙 dagger.io/dagger](https://pkg.go.dev/dagger.io/dagger) via [github.com/dagger/dagger-go-sdk](https://github.com/dagger/dagger-go-sdk/tags).\n- Python packages to [🐍 dagger-io](https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io).\n- Typescript packages to [⬢ npmjs.com/package/@dagger.io/dagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dagger.io/dagger).\n- Elixir packages to [🧪 hex.pm/packages/dagger](https://hex.pm/packages/dagger).\n- Rust crates to [⚙️ crates.io/crate/dagger-sdk](https://crates.io/crates/dagger-sdk).\n- PHP packages to [🐘 packagist.org/packages/dagger/dagger](https://packagist.org/packages/dagger/dagger) via [github.com/dagger/dagger-php-sdk](https://github.com/dagger/dagger-php-sdk/tags).\n- Helm charts to [☸️ registry.dagger.io/dagger-helm](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pkgs/container/dagger-helm).\n\nFinally:\n\n- [ ] Double-check the engine+cli release:\n\n```console\n# install the cli to dagger-0.13.0, and symlink dagger to it\ncurl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin DAGGER_VERSION=0.13.0 sh\nmv ~/.local/bin/dagger{,-0.13.0}\nln -s ~/.local/bin/dagger{-0.13.0,}\n\ndagger version\ndagger core version\n```\n\n- [ ] Double-check that all the above packages have been correctly published\n      and updated to their latest versions.\n\n- [ ] Double-check that git tags + github releases have been made for each component.\n\n### Improve releasing 改善\n\n🚨 Non-main branch release only: you'll likely want the changes from this PR in both `$RELEASE_BRANCH` and `main`.\n\n- [ ] Start an release improvements branch:\n\n```console\ngit checkout -b improve-releasing-during-$ENGINE_VERSION\n```\n\n- [ ] Download and install the latest release, and continue the rest of the\n      release process using the just-released CLI. This is needed now so the\n      `.dagger` module updated below will get `dagger.json`'s engine version bumped.\n\n- [ ] Update the dagger version in `.github/main.go`, then regenerate\n`.github/` configs:\n\n```console\ndagger call -m .github generate directory --path=.github/workflows export --path=.github/workflows --wipe\n```\n\n- [ ] Update non-autogenerated `.github` configs to `$ENGINE_VERSION`\n  - The version numbers (of the form `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`) should be updated to the new version\n  - The worker runner versions (of the form `dagger-v<major>-<minor>-<patch>-<worker>`)\n  - e.g. if bumping 0.12.6->0.12.7, can run `find .github/ -type f -exec sed -i 's/0-12-6/0-12-7/g; s/0\\.12\\.6/0\\.12\\.7/g' {} +`\n\n- [ ] Bump the Go SDK version in our internal CI targets (these aren't actually\n      used anywhere since we use the modularized go SDK - but it's good\n      practice regardless).\n\n```console\ngo mod edit -require dagger.io/dagger@$ENGINE_VERSION\ngo mod edit -require github.com/dagger/dagger/engine/distconsts@$ENGINE_VERSION\ngo mod tidy\ndagger develop\ncd .dagger\ngo mod edit -require github.com/dagger/dagger/engine/distconsts@$ENGINE_VERSION\ngo mod tidy\ncd ..\n\n# add, commit and push the changes to the PR\ngit add .\ngit commit -s -m \"chore: bump internal tooling to $ENGINE_VERSION\"\ngit push\n```\n\n- [ ] Open a PR with the title `Improve Releasing during $ENGINE_VERSION`\n\n```console\ngit add .  # or any other files changed during the last few steps\ngit commit -s -m \"Improve releasing during $ENGINE_VERSION\"\ngit push\n```\n\n## 🚨 Non-main branch release only\n\nAfter the Engine+SDKs are all released from the `release-vX.Y.Z` branch, you will need to \"forward-port\" a few of the commits there up to `main`. Namely:\n\n- The commits from the release notes PR, e.g. when patching `v0.11.8` to `v0.11.9`, [this commit](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/commit/18fd28cfa8f2e5d5f2ccc58fb15a4a975a3660dd)\n- The commits from the SDK engine version bump PR, e.g. when patching `v0.11.8` to `v0.11.9`, the commits from [this PR](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7746)\n- The commits from the CI engine version bump PR, e.g. when patching `v0.11.8` to `v0.11.9`, [this commit](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/commit/58b1865969426357f7c38f2052a93789bd324534)\n\nOne easy way to do this is to re-use the engine version bump PR that was created against `main` earlier, cherry-picking in the missing commits.\n\nBe sure to use \"Rebase and Merge\" when merging the PR to `main` to preserve the history of the cherry-picked commits.\n\n- [Example of this here for `v0.11.9`](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7745)\n\n## 🌌 Daggerverse ⏱ `2mins`\n\n- [ ] Merge the newly opened PR in the dagger.io repository (this is created by\n      the publish workflow). If anything fails, cc the following in the release thread\n      on Discord: cc @jpadams @kpenfound @matipan @gerhard\n\n## 🌥️ Dagger Cloud ⏱ `2mins`\n\n- [ ] Mention in the release thread on Discord that Dagger Cloud can be updated\n      to the just-released version. cc @marcosnils @matipan @sipsma\n\n## 🪣 Install scripts ⏱ `2mins`\n\n- [ ] If the install scripts `install.sh` or `install.ps1` have changed since\n      the last release, they must be manually updated on Amazon S3 (CloudFront\n      should also be manually invalidated). cc @gerhard\n\n## 🐙 dagger-for-github ⏱ `10mins`\n\n- [ ] Submit PR with the version bump, e.g.\n      https://github.com/dagger/dagger-for-github/pull/123\n  - e.g. if bumping 0.12.5->0.12.6, can run `find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/0\\.12\\.5/0\\.12\\.6/g' {} +`\n- [ ] Ask @gerhard or @jpadams to review it\n\n> [!TIP]\n> We should automate the above mentioned steps same as we do with the PR which\n> bumps the Engine version, e.g. https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7318\n\n- [ ] Once this PR is merged, tag the new full semver version\n\n```console\n# Find the latest released patch https://github.com/dagger/dagger-for-github/releases\n# or via the `gh` CLI. Use that to figure out the NEXT_PATCH_VERSION.\n# For `dagger` minor bumps, bump `dagger-for-github` major version.\n# For `dagger` patch bumps, bump `dagger-for-github` minor version. Use `dagger-for-github`\n# patch version for fixes to bugs in `dagger-for-github`.\ngh release view --repo dagger/dagger-for-github --json tagName,publishedAt\n\n# Sign the tag, using the date as the comment, e.g. 2024-07-22\ngit tag --sign -m $(date '+%Y-%m-%d') <NEXT_PATCH_VERSION>\ngit push origin <NEXT_PATCH_VERSION> #shouldn't need to force since new tag\n```\n\n- [ ] Create a new release from the patch tag (auto-fill release notes via the\n      GitHub UI or via the `gh` CLI)\n- [ ] Submit PR to change the version mentioned in Dagger docs. See example [here](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8131)\n\n```console\n# --verify-tag will ensure the last tag creation step was done\ngh release create --generate-notes --verify-tag <NEXT_PATCH_VERSION>\n```\n\n- [ ] Force update the major version, currently `v7`, using the date as the comment, e.g. 2024-07-22\n\n```console\ngit tag --sign -m $(date '+%Y-%m-%d') v7 --force\ngit push origin v7 --force #need to force since moving this tag\n```\n\n## 🍺 dagger Homebrew ⏱ `2mins`\n\n- [ ] Check that Dagger Homebrew formula has been updated to latest, e.g.\n      [dagger 0.12.5](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/181284).\n      This is automated, but note that it may take several hours to trigger.\n\n## ❄️ nix ⏱ `2mins`\n\n- [ ] Check that Dagger nix flake has been updated to latest, e.g. [dagger: ->\n      v0.12.5](https://github.com/dagger/nix/commit/5053689af7d18e67254ba0b2d60fa916b7370104)\n\n## ⚙️ Improvements ⏱ `2mins`\n\n- [ ] When all the above done, remember to add the `RELEASING.md` changes to\n      the `improve-releasing-during-v...` PR that you have opened earlier (remember\n      to toggle all the checkboxes back to `[ ]`). Here is an example:\n      https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/5658\n\n## Last step\n\n- [ ] Close the Discord release thread you created in [Let the team know](#let-the-team-know)\n- [ ] Close the GitHub milestone you created in [Let the team know](#let-the-team-know)\n  - If there are remaining PRs/issues that were not resolved, then move\n    them into the next milestone (or remove it from a milestone entirely)\n"

Generate a _dagger completion script and write it to a file within your \\$FPATH, e.g.:\n\n      ${binexe} completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_dagger\n\n    2. Ensure that the following is present in your ~/.zshrc:\n\n      autoload -U compinit\n      compinit -i\n\n    zsh version 5.7 or later is recommended.\n\n  FISH:\n\n    1.
