          "content": "# Nuclei Architecture Document\n\nA brief overview of Nuclei Engine architecture. This document will be kept updated as the engine progresses.\n\n## pkg/templates\n\n### Template\n\nTemplate is the basic unit of input to the engine which describes the requests to be made, matching to be done, data to extract, etc.\n\nThe template structure is described here. Template level attributes are defined here as well as convenience methods to validate, parse and compile templates creating executers. \n\nAny attributes etc. required for the template, engine or requests to function are also set here.\n\nWorkflows are also compiled, their templates are loaded and compiled as well. Any validations etc. on the paths provided are also done here.\n\n`Parse` function is the main entry point which returns a template for a `filePath` and `executorOptions`. It compiles all the requests for the templates, all the workflows, as well as any self-contained request etc. It also caches the templates in an in-memory cache.\n\n### Preprocessors\n\nPreprocessors are also applied here which can do things at template level. They get data of the template which they can alter at will on runtime. This is used in the engine to do random string generation.\n\nCustom processor can be used if they satisfy the following interface.\n\n```go\ntype Preprocessor interface {\n\tProcess(data []byte) []byte\n}\n```\n\n## pkg/model\n\nModel package implements Information structure for Nuclei Templates. `Info` contains all major metadata information for the template. `Classification` structure can also be used to provide additional context to vulnerability data.\n\nIt also specifies a `WorkflowLoader` interface that is used during workflow loading in template compilation stage.\n\n```go\ntype WorkflowLoader interface {\n\tGetTemplatePathsByTags(tags []string) []string\n\tGetTemplatePaths(templatesList []string, noValidate bool) []string\n}\n```\n\n## pkg/protocols\n\nProtocols package implements all the request protocols supported by Nuclei. This includes http, dns, network, headless and file requests as of now. \n\n### Request\n\nIt exposes a `Request` interface that is implemented by all the request protocols supported.\n\n```go\n// Request is an interface implemented any protocol based request generator.\ntype Request interface {\n\tCompile(options *ExecuterOptions) error\n\tRequests() int\n\tGetID() string\n\tMatch(data map[string]interface{}, matcher *matchers.Matcher) (bool, []string)\n\tExtract(data map[string]interface{}, matcher *extractors.Extractor) map[string]struct{}\n\tExecuteWithResults(input string, dynamicValues, previous output.InternalEvent, callback OutputEventCallback) error\n\tMakeResultEventItem(wrapped *output.InternalWrappedEvent) *output.ResultEvent\n\tMakeResultEvent(wrapped *output.InternalWrappedEvent) []*output.ResultEvent\n\tGetCompiledOperators() []*operators.Operators\n}\n```\n\nMany of these methods are similar across protocols while some are very protocol specific. \n\nA brief overview of the methods is provided below -\n\n- **Compile** - Compiles the request with provided options.\n- **Requests** - Returns total requests made.\n- **GetID** - Returns any ID for the request\n- **Match** - Used to perform matching for patterns using matchers\n- **Extract** - Used to perform extraction for patterns using extractors\n- **ExecuteWithResults** - Request execution function for input.\n- **MakeResultEventItem** - Creates a single result event for the intermediate `InternalWrappedEvent` output structure.\n- **MakeResultEvent** - Returns a slice of results based on an `InternalWrappedEvent` internal output event.\n- **GetCompiledOperators** - Returns the compiled operators for the request.\n\n`MakeDefaultResultEvent` function can be used as a default for `MakeResultEvent` function when no protocol-specific features need to be implemented for result generation. \n\nFor reference protocol requests implementations, one can look at the below packages  - \n\n1. [pkg/protocols/http](./pkg/protocols/http)\n2. [pkg/protocols/dns](./pkg/protocols/dns)\n3. [pkg/protocols/network](./pkg/protocols/network)\n\n### Executer\n\nAll these different requests interfaces are converted to an Executer which is also an interface defined in `pkg/protocols` which is used during final execution of the template.\n\n```go\n// Executer is an interface implemented any protocol based request executer.\ntype Executer interface {\n\tCompile() error\n\tRequests() int\n\tExecute(input string) (bool, error)\n\tExecuteWithResults(input string, callback OutputEventCallback) error\n}\n```\n\nThe `ExecuteWithResults` function accepts a callback, which gets provided with results during execution in form of `*output.InternalWrappedEvent` structure.\n\nThe default executer is provided in `pkg/protocols/common/executer` . It takes a list of Requests and relevant `ExecuterOptions` and implements the Executer interface required for template execution. The executer during Template compilation process is created from this package and used as-is.\n\nA different executer is the Clustered Requests executer which implements the Nuclei Request clustering functionality in `pkg/templates`  We have a single HTTP  request in cases where multiple templates can be clustered and multiple operator lists to match/extract. The first HTTP request is executed while all the template matcher/extractor are evaluated separately.\n\nFor Workflow execution, a separate RunWorkflow function is used which executes the workflow independently of the template execution.\n\nWith this basic premise set, we can now start exploring the current runner implementation which will also walk us through the architecture of nuclei.\n\n## internal/runner\n\n### Template loading\n\nThe first process after all CLI specific initialisation is the loading of template/workflow paths that the user wants to run. This is done by the packages described below.\n\n#### pkg/catalog\n\nThis package is used to get paths using mixed syntax. It takes a template directory and performs resolving for template paths both from provided template and current user directory.\n\nThe syntax is very versatile and can include filenames, glob patterns, directories, absolute paths, and relative-paths.\n\n\n\nNext step is the initialisation of the reporting modules which is handled in `pkg/reporting`.  \n\n#### pkg/reporting\n\nReporting module contains exporters and trackers as well as a module for deduplication and a module for result formatting. \n\nExporters and Trackers are interfaces defined in pkg/reporting.\n\n```go\n// Tracker is an interface implemented by an issue tracker\ntype Tracker interface {\n\tCreateIssue(event *output.ResultEvent) error\n}\n\n// Exporter is an interface implemented by an issue exporter\ntype Exporter interface {\n\tClose() error\n\tExport(event *output.ResultEvent) error\n}\n```\n\nExporters include `Elasticsearch`, `markdown`, `sarif` . Trackers include `GitHub` , `GitLab` and `Jira`.\n\nEach exporter and trackers implement their own configuration in YAML format and are very modular in nature, so adding new ones is easy.\n\n\n\nAfter reading all the inputs from various sources and initialisation other miscellaneous options, the next bit is the output writing which is done using `pkg/output` module.\n\n#### pkg/output\n\nOutput package implements the output writing functionality for Nuclei.\n\nOutput Writer implements the Writer interface which is called each time a result is found for nuclei.\n\n```go\n// Writer is an interface which writes output to somewhere for nuclei events.\ntype Writer interface {\n\tClose()\n\tColorizer() aurora.Aurora\n\tWrite(*ResultEvent) error\n\tRequest(templateID, url, requestType string, err error)\n}\n```\n\nResultEvent structure is passed to the Nuclei Output Writer which contains the entire detail of a found result. Various intermediary types like `InternalWrappedEvent` and `InternalEvent` are used throughout nuclei protocols and matchers to describe results in various stages of execution.\n\n\n\n Interactsh is also initialised if it is not explicitly disabled. \n\n#### pkg/protocols/common/interactsh\n\nInteractsh module is used to provide automatic Out-of-Band vulnerability identification in Nuclei. \n\nIt uses two LRU caches, one for storing interactions for request URLs and one for storing requests for interaction URL. These both caches are used to correlated requests received to the Interactsh OOB server and Nuclei Instance. [Interactsh Client](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/pkg/client) package does most of the heavy lifting of this module.\n\nPolling for interactions and server registration only starts when a template uses the interactsh module and is executed by nuclei. After that no registration is required for the entire run.\n\n\n\n### RunEnumeration\n\nNext we arrive in the `RunEnumeration` function of the runner.\n\n`HostErrorsCache` is initialised which is used throughout the run of Nuclei enumeration to keep track of errors per host and skip further requests if the errors are greater than the provided threshold. The functionality for the error tracking cache is defined in [hosterrorscache.go](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/blob/main/pkg/protocols/common/hosterrorscache/hosterrorscache.go) and is pretty simplistic in nature.\n\nNext the `WorkflowLoader` is initialised which used to load workflows. It exists in `pkg/parsers/workflow_loader.go`\n\nThe loader is initialised moving forward which is responsible for Using Catalog, Passed Tags, Filters, Paths, etc. to return compiled `Templates` and `Workflows`. \n\n#### pkg/catalog/loader\n\nFirst the input passed by the user as paths is normalised to absolute paths which is done by the `pkg/catalog` module.  Next the path filter module is used to remove the excluded template/workflows paths.\n\n`pkg/parsers` module's `LoadTemplate`,`LoadWorkflow` functions are used to check if the templates pass the validation + are not excluded via tags/severity/etc. filters. If all checks are passed, then the template/workflow is parsed and returned in a compiled form by the `pkg/templates`'s `Parse` function.\n\n`Parse` function performs compilation of all the requests in a template + creates Executers from them returning a runnable Template/Workflow structure.\n\nClustering module comes in next whose job is to cluster identical HTTP GET requests together (as a lot of the templates perform the same get requests many times, it's a good way to save many requests on large scans with lots of templates). \n\n### pkg/operators\n\nOperators package implements all the matching and extracting logic of Nuclei. \n\n```go\n// Operators contain the operators that can be applied on protocols\ntype Operators struct {\n\tMatchers []*matchers.Matcher\n\tExtractors []*extractors.Extractor\n\tMatchersCondition string\n}\n```\n\nA protocol only needs to embed the `operators.Operators` type shown above, and it can utilise all the matching/extracting functionality of nuclei.\n\n```go\n// MatchFunc performs matching operation for a matcher on model and returns true or false.\ntype MatchFunc func(data map[string]interface{}, matcher *matchers.Matcher) (bool, []string)\n\n// ExtractFunc performs extracting operation for an extractor on model and returns true or false.\ntype ExtractFunc func(data map[string]interface{}, matcher *extractors.Extractor) map[string]struct{}\n\n// Execute executes the operators on data and returns a result structure\nfunc (operators *Operators) Execute(data map[string]interface{}, match MatchFunc, extract ExtractFunc, isDebug bool) (*Result, bool) \n```\n\nThe core of this process is the Execute function which takes an input dictionary as well as a Match and Extract function and return a `Result` structure which is used later during nuclei execution to check for results.\n\n```go\n// Result is a result structure created from operators running on data.\ntype Result struct {\n\tMatched bool\n\tExtracted bool\n\tMatches map[string][]string\n\tExtracts map[string][]string\n\tOutputExtracts []string\n\tDynamicValues map[string]interface{}\n\tPayloadValues map[string]interface{}\n}\n```\n\nThe internal logics for matching and extracting for things like words, regexes, jq, paths, etc. is specified in `pkg/operators/matchers`, `pkg/operators/extractors`. Those packages should be investigated for further look into the topic.\n\n\n### Template Execution\n\n`pkg/core` provides the engine mechanism which runs the templates/workflows on inputs. It exposes an `Execute` function which does the task of execution while also doing template clustering. The clustering can also be disabled optionally by the user.\n \nAn example of using the core engine is provided below.\n\n```go\nengine := core.New(r.options)\nengine.SetExecuterOptions(executerOpts)\nresults := engine.ExecuteWithOpts(finalTemplates, r.hmapInputProvider, true)\n```\n\n### Adding a New Protocol\n\nProtocols form the core of Nuclei Engine. All the request types like `http`, `dns`, etc. are implemented in form of protocol requests.\n\nA protocol must implement the `Protocol` and `Request` interfaces described above in `pkg/protocols`. We'll take the example of an existing protocol implementation - websocket for this short reference around Nuclei internals.\n\nThe code for the websocket protocol is contained in `pkg/protocols/others/websocket`. \n\nBelow a high level skeleton of the websocket implementation is provided with all the important parts present.\n\n```go\npackage websocket\n\n// Request is a request for the Websocket protocol\ntype Request struct {\n\t// Operators for the current request go here.\n\toperators.Operators `yaml:\",inline,omitempty\"`\n\tCompiledOperators   *operators.Operators `yaml:\"-\"`\n\n\t// description: |\n\t//   Address contains address for the request\n\tAddress string `yaml:\"address,omitempty\" jsonschema:\"title=address for the websocket request,description=Address contains address for the request\"`\n\n    // declarations here\n}\n\n// Compile compiles the request generators preparing any requests possible.\nfunc (r *Request) Compile(options *protocols.ExecuterOptions) error {\n\tr.options = options\n\n    // request compilation here as well as client creation\n \n\tif len(r.Matchers) > 0 || len(r.Extractors) > 0 {\n\t\tcompiled := &r.Operators\n\t\tif err := compiled.Compile(); err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn errors.Wrap(err, \"could not compile operators\")\n\t\t}\n\t\tr.CompiledOperators = compiled\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\n// Requests returns the total number of requests the rule will perform\nfunc (r *Request) Requests() int {\n\tif r.generator != nil {\n\t\treturn r.generator.NewIterator().Total()\n\t}\n\treturn 1\n}\n\n// GetID returns the ID for the request if any.\nfunc (r *Request) GetID() string {\n\treturn \"\"\n}\n\n// ExecuteWithResults executes the protocol requests and returns results instead of writing them.\nfunc (r *Request) ExecuteWithResults(input string, dynamicValues, previous output.InternalEvent, callback protocols.OutputEventCallback) error {\n    // payloads init here\n\tif err := r.executeRequestWithPayloads(input, hostname, value, previous, callback); err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\n// ExecuteWithResults executes the protocol requests and returns results instead of writing them.\nfunc (r *Request) executeRequestWithPayloads(input, hostname string, dynamicValues, previous output.InternalEvent, callback protocols.OutputEventCallback) error {\n\theader := http.Header{}\n\n    // make the actual request here after setting all options\n\n\tevent := eventcreator.CreateEventWithAdditionalOptions(r, data, r.options.Options.Debug || r.options.Options.DebugResponse, func(internalWrappedEvent *output.InternalWrappedEvent) {\n\t\tinternalWrappedEvent.OperatorsResult.PayloadValues = payloadValues\n\t})\n\tif r.options.Options.Debug || r.options.Options.DebugResponse {\n\t\tresponseOutput := responseBuilder.String()\n\t\tgologger.Debug().Msgf(\"[%s] Dumped Websocket response for %s\", r.options.TemplateID, input)\n\t\tgologger.Print().Msgf(\"%s\", responsehighlighter.Highlight(event.OperatorsResult, responseOutput, r.options.Options.NoColor))\n\t}\n\n\tcallback(event)\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nfunc (r *Request) MakeResultEventItem(wrapped *output.InternalWrappedEvent) *output.ResultEvent {\n\tdata := &output.ResultEvent{\n\t\tTemplateID:       types.ToString(r.options.TemplateID),\n\t\tTemplatePath:     types.ToString(r.options.TemplatePath),\n\t\t// ... setting more values for result event\n\t}\n\treturn data\n}\n\n// Match performs matching operation for a matcher on model and returns:\n// true and a list of matched snippets if the matcher type is supports it\n// otherwise false and an empty string slice\nfunc (r *Request) Match(data map[string]interface{}, matcher *matchers.Matcher) (bool, []string) {\n\treturn protocols.MakeDefaultMatchFunc(data, matcher)\n}\n\n// Extract performs extracting operation for an extractor on model and returns true or false.\nfunc (r *Request) Extract(data map[string]interface{}, matcher *extractors.Extractor) map[string]struct{} {\n\treturn protocols.MakeDefaultExtractFunc(data, matcher)\n}\n\n// MakeResultEvent creates a result event from internal wrapped event\nfunc (r *Request) MakeResultEvent(wrapped *output.InternalWrappedEvent) []*output.ResultEvent {\n\treturn protocols.MakeDefaultResultEvent(r, wrapped)\n}\n\n// GetCompiledOperators returns a list of the compiled operators\nfunc (r *Request) GetCompiledOperators() []*operators.Operators {\n\treturn []*operators.Operators{r.CompiledOperators}\n}\n\n// Type returns the type of the protocol request\nfunc (r *Request) Type() templateTypes.ProtocolType {\n\treturn templateTypes.WebsocketProtocol\n}\n```\n\nAlmost all of these protocols have boilerplate functions for which default implementations have been provided in the `providers` package. Examples are the implementation of `Match`, `Extract`, `MakeResultEvent`, `GetCompiledOperators`, etc. which are almost same throughout Nuclei protocols code. It is enough to copy-paste them unless customization is required.\n\n`eventcreator` package offers `CreateEventWithAdditionalOptions` function which can be used to create result events after doing request execution.\n\nStep by step description of how to add a new protocol to Nuclei - \n\n1. Add the protocol implementation in `pkg/protocols` directory. If it's a small protocol with fewer options, considering adding it to the `pkg/protocols/others` directory. Add the enum for the new protocol to `pkg/templates/types/types.go`.\n\n2. Add the protocol request structure to the `Template` structure fields. This is done in `pkg/templates/templates.go` with the corresponding import line.\n\n```go\n\nimport (\n\t...\n\t\"github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/pkg/protocols/others/websocket\"\n)\n\n// Template is a YAML input file which defines all the requests and\n// other metadata for a template.\ntype Template struct {\n\t...\n\t// description: |\n\t//   Websocket contains the Websocket request to make in the template.\n\tRequestsWebsocket []*websocket.Request `yaml:\"websocket,omitempty\" json:\"websocket,omitempty\" jsonschema:\"title=websocket requests to make,description=Websocket requests to make for the template\"`\n\t...\n}\n```\n\nAlso add the protocol case to the `Type` function as well as the `TemplateTypes` array in the same `templates.go` file.\n\n```go\n// TemplateTypes is a list of accepted template types\nvar TemplateTypes = []string{\n\t...\n\t\"websocket\",\n}\n\n// Type returns the type of the template\nfunc (t *Template) Type() templateTypes.ProtocolType {\n\t...\n\tcase len(t.RequestsWebsocket) > 0:\n\t\treturn templateTypes.WebsocketProtocol\n\tdefault:\n\t\treturn \"\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n3. Add the protocol request to the `Requests` function and `compileProtocolRequests` function in the `compile.go` file in same directory.\n\n```go\n\n// Requests return the total request count for the template\nfunc (template *Template) Requests() int {\n\treturn len(template.RequestsDNS) +\n\t\t...\n\t\tlen(template.RequestsSSL) +\n\t\tlen(template.RequestsWebsocket)\n}\n\n\n// compileProtocolRequests compiles all the protocol requests for the template\nfunc (template *Template) compileProtocolRequests(options protocols.ExecuterOptions) error {\n\t...\n\n\tcase len(template.RequestsWebsocket) > 0:\n\t\trequests = template.convertRequestToProtocolsRequest(template.RequestsWebsocket)\n\t}\n\ttemplate.Executer = executer.NewExecuter(requests, &options)\n\treturn nil\n}\n```\n\nThat's it, you've added a new protocol to Nuclei. The next good step would be to write integration tests which are described in `integration-tests` and `cmd/integration-tests` directories.\n\n\n## Profiling and Tracing\n\nTo analyze Nuclei's performance and resource usage, you can generate memory profiles and trace files using the `-profile-mem` flag:\n\n```bash\nnuclei -t nuclei-templates/ -u https://example.com -profile-mem=nuclei-$(git describe --tags)\n```\n\nThis command creates two files:\n\n* `nuclei.prof`: Memory (heap) profile\n* `nuclei.trace`: Execution trace\n\n### Analyzing the Memory Profile\n\n1.

This allows easy extensibility capabilities to nuclei. The templates are written in YAML which specifies a simple human-readable format to quickly define the execution process.\n\n**Try it online with our free AI powered Nuclei Templates Editor by** [**`clicking here`**](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/templates).\n\nNuclei Templates offer a streamlined way to identify and communicate vulnerabilities, combining essential details like severity ratings and detection methods. This open-source, community-developed tool accelerates threat response and is widely recognized in the cybersecurity world. Nuclei templates are actively contributed by thousands of security researchers globally. We run two programs for our contributors: [**`Pioneers`**](https://projectdiscovery.io/pioneers) and [**`💎 bounties`**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%8E%20Bounty%22).\n\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n    <a href=\"/static/nuclei-templates-teamcity.png\"  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/static/nuclei-templates-teamcity.png\" width=\"1200px\" alt=\"Nuclei template example for detecting TeamCity misconfiguration\" /></a>\n</p>\n\n#### Examples\n\nVisit [**our documentation**](https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/introduction) for use cases and ideas.\n\n| Use case                             | Nuclei template                                    |\n| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |\n| Detect known CVEs                    | **[CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/CVE-2021-45046)**                     |\n| Identify Out-of-Band vulnerabilities | **[Blind SQL Injection via OOB](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/CVE-2024-22120)**                    |\n| SQL Injection detection              | **[Generic SQL Injection](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/CVE-2022-34265)**                          |\n| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)           | **[Reflected XSS Detection](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/CVE-2023-4173)**                        |\n| Default or weak passwords            | **[Default Credentials Check](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/airflow-default-login)**                      |\n| Secret files or data exposure        | **[Sensitive File Disclosure](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/airflow-configuration-exposure)**                      |\n| Identify open redirects              | **[Open Redirect Detection](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/open-redirect)**                        |\n| Detect subdomain takeovers           | **[Subdomain Takeover Templates](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/azure-takeover-detection)**                   |\n| Security misconfigurations           | **[Unprotected Jenkins Console](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/unauthenticated-jenkins)**                    |\n| Weak SSL/TLS configurations          | **[SSL Certificate Expiry](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/expired-ssl)**                         |\n| Misconfigured cloud services         | **[Open S3 Bucket Detection](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/s3-public-read-acp)**                       |\n| Remote code execution vulnerabilities| **[RCE Detection Templates](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/CVE-2024-29824)**                        |\n| Directory traversal attacks          | **[Path Traversal Detection](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/oracle-fatwire-lfi)**                       |\n| File inclusion vulnerabilities       | **[Local/Remote File Inclusion](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/public/CVE-2023-6977)**                    |\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Our Mission\n\nTraditional vulnerability scanners were built decades ago. They are closed-source, incredibly slow, and vendor-driven. Today's attackers are mass exploiting newly released CVEs across the internet within days, unlike the years it used to take. This shift requires a completely different approach to tackling trending exploits on the internet.\n\nWe built Nuclei to solve this challenge. We made the entire scanning engine framework open and customizable—allowing the global security community to collaborate and tackle the trending attack vectors and vulnerabilities on the internet. Nuclei is now used and contributed by Fortune 500 enterprises, government agencies, universities.\n\nYou can participate by contributing to our code, [**`templates library`**](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates), or [**`joining our team`**](https://projectdiscovery.io/).\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Contributors :heart:\n\nThanks to all the amazing

Nuclei menawarkan pemindaian untuk berbagai protokol, termasuk TCP, DNS, HTTP, SSL, File, Whois, Websocket, Headless, dll. Dengan templating yang kuat dan fleksibel, Nuclei dapat digunakan untuk memodelkan semua jenis pemeriksaan keamanan.\n\nKami memiliki [repositori khusus](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) yang menampung berbagai jenis templat kerentanan yang disumbangkan oleh **lebih dari 300** peneliti dan teknisi keamanan.\n\n\n## Cara Kerja\n\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"static/nuclei-flow.jpg\" alt=\"nuclei-flow\" width=\"700px\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n\n# Instalasi Nuclei\n\nNuclei membutuhkan **go1.21** agar dapat diinstall.
