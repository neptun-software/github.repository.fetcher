Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.\n\nPlease fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).\n\n  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/node/285/node/285/individual-signup).\n  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/node/285/organization-signup).\n\nFollow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.\n\n### Contributing A Patch\n\n1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.\n2. The [repo owners](OWNERS) will respond to your issue promptly.\n3. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).\n4. Before starting to work on an issue, type `/lifecycle active` in a comment on the issue or contact a Kubeadm maintainer to do so;\n   The `lifecycle/active` label denotes to the community that the issue is currently being worked on and it signals to the\n   reviewers and approvers that patches are coming soon.\n   If instead you are planning to work on an issue created by other contributors, it would be nice to comment on the issue about\n   your intentions and then wait 2 or 3 days for feedback before adding `lifecycle/active` label and actually start working on it.\n5. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.\n6. Submit a pull request.\n\n### Contributing kubeadm documentation\n\n`kubeadm` is documented in various places on the [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/search/?q=kubeadmin) website.\nThese pages cover topics such as installation steps, troubleshooting and command line syntax.\nYou can help `kubeadm` **a lot** by filling issue reports for inconsistencies and keeping the documentation up-to-date by submitting PRs.\n\nThe process for contributing to the website is very straight forward and is outlined here:\n* https://git.k8s.io/website/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nHere is a document that explains the process of updating the `kubeadm` command line reference:\n* https://git.k8s.io/kubeadm/docs/updating-command-reference.md\n\n### Building\n\n`kubeadm` uses the same build process as the rest of the `kubernetes/kubernetes` repository.\nHowever, you do not frequently have to build all of kubernetes to work on kubeadm.\n\nSee [./kinder/README.md](./kinder/README.md) for a quick workflow to build and test your own kubeadm binaries. ðŸ™‚\n\n### Testing pre-release versions of Kubernetes with kubeadm\n\nSee [testing-pre-releases.md](./docs/testing-pre-releases.md) for information about how to get pre-release versions of kubernetes\nor kubeadm and how to test them.\n\n### Adding dependencies\n\nIf your patch depends on new packages, add that package with [`godep`](https://github.com/tools/godep). Follow the [instructions to add a dependency](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/development.md).\n\n### Running unit tests\n\nFirst navigate to the directory where you have cloned kubernetes (e.g. `~/go/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`).\n\nYou can run unit tests for specific `kubeadm` packages using:\n```\nmake test WHAT=<package> GOFLAGS=\"-v\"\n```\nWhere `<package>` can be `./cmd/kubeadm/app/cmd`, `./cmd/kubeadm/app/util`, `./cmd/kubeadm/app/features`, etc.\n\nTo run kubeadm command line integration tests call:\n```\nmake test-cmd WHAT=kubeadm\n```\n\nFor more information about running tests in Kubernetes have a look at:\n* https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md\n\nFor more general information about unit tests in Go please have a look at:\n* https://golang.org/pkg/testing/\n* https://blog.alexellis.io/golang-writing-unit-tests/\n\n### Instructional videos\n\n* [kubeadm onboarding 2019-11-04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0OJW0nlEpQ)\n* [developing kubeadm 101 - 2020-01-05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtTfRm_jzzM)\n"
