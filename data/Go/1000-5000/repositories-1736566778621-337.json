They should be able to specify what \"kind\" of application it is and how\nit fits into their overall architecture; the infrastructure should be generated from that.\n* **Create modern applications by default.**\nModern applications can consist of one or more services, jobs, and supporting resources like databases. \nCopilot ensures that all parts of an application are wired together securely and sensibly.\n* **Deliver applications continuously.**\nWhile the AWS Copilot CLI can be used to manually deploy changes to an application, we always help customers to move to CI/CD by helping them set up and manage pipelines.\n* **Operations is part of the workflow.**\nModeling, provisioning, and deploying applications are only part of the application lifecycle for the developer.\nThe CLI must support workflows around troubleshooting and debugging to help when things go wrong.\n"

          "content": "# Contributing to the CLI\n\nThanks for your interest in contributing to the AWS Copilot CLI! 💖\n\nThis document describes how to set up a development environment and submit your contributions.\nPlease read it over and let us know if it's not up-to-date (or, even better, submit a PR with your corrections 😉).\n\n- [Development setup](#development-setup)\n  - [Environment](#environment)\n  - [Set upstream](#set-upstream)\n  - [Building and testing](#building-and-testing)\n  - [Generating mocks](#generating-mocks)\n  - [Adding new dependencies](#adding-new-dependencies)\n- [Where should I start?](#where-should-i-start)\n- [Contributing code](#contributing-code)\n- [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](#amazon-open-source-code-of-conduct)\n- [Licensing](#licensing)\n\n## Development setup\n\n### Environment\n\n- Make sure you are using Go 1.21 (`go version`).\n- Fork the repository.\n- Clone your forked repository locally.\n- We use Go Modules to manage dependencies, so you can develop outside of your $GOPATH.\n\n#### Set upstream\n\nFrom the repository root run:\n\n`git remote add upstream git@github.com:aws/copilot-cli`\n\n`git fetch upstream`\n\n### Building and testing\n\nThere are three different types of testing done on the AWS Copilot CLI.\n\n**Unit tests** makes up the majority of the testing and new code should include unit tests.\nIdeally, these unit tests will be in the same package as the file they're testing and have full coverage (or as much is practical within a unit test).\nUnit tests shouldn't make any network calls.\n\n**Integration tests** are rarer and test the CLI's integration with remote services, such as the file system, CloudFormation, or SSM.\nOur integration tests ensure that we can call these remote services and get the results we expect.\n\n**End to End tests** run the CLI in a container and test the actual commands - including spinning and tearing down remote resources (like ECS clusters and VPCs).\nThese tests are the most comprehensive and run on both Windows and Linux build fleets.\nFeel free to run these tests - but they require two AWS accounts to run in, so be mindful that resources will be created and destroyed.\nYou'll need four [named profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html): `default`, `test`, `prod` and `shared`.\n\nBelow are the different commands which can be run in the root of the project directory.\n\n* Run `make` (This creates a standalone executable in the `bin/local` directory).\n* Run `make run-unit-test` to run only Go unit tests.\n* Run `make local-test` to run Go, Node.js unit tests and local integration tests. You'll need Node.js and npm for these tests to run.\n* Run `make integ-test` to run integration tests against your Default AWS profile. **Warning** - this will create AWS resources in your `default` profile.\n* Run `make e2e` to run end-to-end tests (tests that run commands locally). **Warning** - this will create AWS resources in your account. You'll need Docker running for these tests to run.\n\n### Generating mocks\nOften times, it's helpful to generate mocks to make unit-testing easier and more focused. We strongly encourage this and encourage you to generate mocks when appropriate! In order to generate mocks:\n\n* Add the package your interface is in under the [gen-mocks](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/blob/master/Makefile) command in the Makefile.\n* run `make gen-mocks`\n\n## Adding new dependencies\n\nIn general, we discourage adding new dependencies to the AWS Copilot CLI. If there's a module you think the CLI could benefit from, first open a PR with your proposal.\nWe'll evaluate the dependency and the use case and decide on the next steps. To evaluate if we need to add the dependency please take a look at [https://research.swtch.com/deps](https://research.swtch.com/deps).\n\n## Where should I start?\n\nWe're so excited you want to contribute to the CLI! We welcome all PRs and will try to get to them as soon as possible.\nThe best place to start, though, is with filing an issue first. Filing an issue gives us some time to chat about the code you're keen on writing, and make sure that it's not already being worked on, or has already been discussed.\n\nYou can also check out our [issues queue](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/issues) to see all the known issues - this is a really great place to start.\n\nIf you want to get your feet wet, check out issues tagged with [good first issue](https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\nThese issues are great for folks who are looking to get started, but not sure where to start 😁.\n\n## Contributing code\n* Please check the existing issues to see if your feedback has already been reported.\n\n* Let us know if you are interested in working on an issue by leaving a comment\non the issue in GitHub. This helps avoid multiple people unknowingly working on\nthe same issue.\n\n* If you would like to propose a new feature, please open an issue on GitHub with\na detailed description. This enables us to collaborate on the feature design\nmore easily and increases the chances that your feature request will be accepted.\n\n* New features should include full test coverage.\n\n* New files should include the standard license  header.\n\n* All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more\ninformation on using pull requests.\n\n* If you choose to submit a GitHub pull request, make sure its name conforms to\nthe [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard!\n\n## Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct\n\nThis code of conduct provides guidance on participation in Amazon-managed open source communities, and outlines the process for reporting unacceptable behavior.

We value a **consistent** user experience across commands.\nThis means that similar things should be done in similar ways, but that dissimilar things should be done in different ways.\n\n## Command grammar\nCommands follow the style \"noun verb\" or only \"verb\". For example, `app ls` or `init`.\nThe noun represents an entity and should be singular. Command names are lowercase words or acronyms (no hyphens, colons, underscores).\n\nWe don’t nest commands beyond a single level. If you want to add an additional noun under an existing command,\ncreate an additional command and use flags instead. For example, adding a service to an app\nshould be `svc init --app <name>` instead of `app add svc`.\n\nTypical command structures are:\n\n* Showing an individual resource: `copilot [entity] show [identifier] [options]`\n* Listing all resources: `copilot [entity] ls [options]`\n* Creating a new resource: `copilot [entity] init [identifier] [options]`\n* Updating a resource: `copilot [entity] update [options]`\n* Deleting a resource: `copilot [entity] delete [identifier...] [options]`\n\n## Input\n### Arguments\nThe rule-of-thumb is to use at most one argument per command. Commands with positional arguments introduces\nadditional cognitive load to the user as they have to remember the order of the arguments.\n\nA command should have an argument when there is only one required input for it.\nFor example, `app init [name]`. All other inputs are present as flags as they're optional.\nThe argument’s name should be obvious to the user. If there is any possible confusion, the long description of the\ncommand should bring clarity on what the input represents.\n\nThe exception to the rule is if you want to write a bulk command, where the type of the arguments are the same and\ntheir order doesn’t matter, such as `copilot env delete test-pdx test-iad`.\n\n### Flags\nFlags are used when you need more than one required input of different type or if the inputs are optional.\nEvery flag needs to have a description and should [use full sentences](#use-full-sentences).\nAll flag names are lowercase and the same across commands. Long flag names can use hyphens if necessary to disambiguate.\n\nFlags can also have a single character short name such as `env init -n MyEnv -a MyApp`.\nRequired flags must have a short name, only provide a short name to an optional flag if you think it will be frequently used.\n\nOptional flags must have a default value. We want users to have the freedom to execute complex operations,\nbut by providing sane defaults we reduce the cognitive load to accomplish a task.\n\n### Prompting\nPrompt the user for any required flag that the user did not provide a value for. Prompting is a human-friendly way of showing options:\n![prompt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879348/65549185-e4394380-ded1-11e9-9fce-f1b19cd4f27f.png)\n\nDon’t prompt the user if a flag value was provided to enable scripting.\nPrompts should be written to `stderr`.\nHighlight the important words in a prompt by bolding and italicizing the words.\n\n### Deleting and modifying production resources\nAny command that deletes or acts on a production resource should prompt the user to make sure they want to proceed with the action.\nThe flag `-y, --yes` should be present in these commands to skip confirmation.\n\n## Autocomplete\nCommand names and flag names should be autocompleted using the <tab><tab> keys.\n\n## Use full sentences\nGuidance text for the user must use full sentences, begin with a capital letter, and end with punctuation.\nFor example, the description for `env init` is “Creates a new environment in your application.” and not “creates a new environment in your application”.\nSimilarly, when we prompt the user for additional information, we use full sentences.\n\n## Stdout vs. Stderr\nThe console displays text written to both `stdout` and `stderr`. However, when you pipe the output of one command to another, only\n`stdout` is passed over. Any data that can be used as input to a subsequent command should be written to `stdout`.\nAll other information should be written to `stderr`.\n\nTypically, for listing or showing a resource we write a table to `stdout`. For mutation commands, we write the prompts and\ndiagnostic messages to `stderr` and at the end write the id of the resources created to `stdout`.\n\n## Screen sizes\nBy default most terminals default to [80x24 character screens](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148754/why-is-24-lines-a-common-default-terminal-height).\nBreak your sentences such that they don't go beyond 80 characters in a single line.\nOtherwise, new line breaks might be oddly placed in screens of varying sizes.\nWhile displaying [progress](#progress), don't show more than 24 lines at a time. Otherwise, the cursor\nwon't be able to move above 24 lines and you'll have truncated progress events.\n\n## Output\n### Colors\nWe use [colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors) to set highlights — catching the user’s eye with important information.\nWe do not use color as the primary means of communication. Running without color support should not meaningfully degrade the UX.\nFor categorical data we use distinctive colors.\n\nCommon categorical data are debug, info, warning, success, failure messages.\nWe respectively use _white_, default, _yellow_, _bright green_ and _bright red_ for these messages.\nFor highlighting user input, use _cyan_.\nFor highlighting created resources, use _bring cyan_.\nFor highlighting follow-up commands, use _bring cyan_ and wrap the text with the back quote character (\\`).\n\n### Data\nCommands that perform “read” operations should write their results to `stdout`.\n\nIf the data can be in a table format, make sure it's grep-parseable.\nDisplay data in a [human-readable](https://github.com/dustin/go-humanize) format (friendly numbers, singular vs. plural, no ISO).\nCommands that output tables should provide a `--json` flag and other possible formats like `--yaml` to display the raw response in JSON/YAML format.\n\n```\n$ copilot env ls\ntest-pdx\n$ ecs env ls --json\n{\"environments\":[{\"app\":\"appName\",\"name\":\"test\",\"region\":\"us-west-2\",\"accountID\":\"123456789012\",\"prod\":false,\"registryURL\":\"\",\"executionRoleARN\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/buildspec-test-CFNExecutionRole\",\"managerRoleARN\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/buildspec-test-EnvManagerRole\"}]}\n```\n\nIf the command can listen on updates, then provide a `--follow` flag.\n\n### List commands\n\nFor list commands like `app ls`, `env ls`, and `svc ls`, prefer formatting the output in a table. Include the name of the resource in the first column, and useful contextual metadata in additional columns. In general, prefer less information in list commands, as the amount of data shown grows with the number of entities being listed and can quickly become overwhelming.\n\n```\n$ copilot svc ls\nName                Type\n--------            ---------------------\nkudos-api           Load Balanced Web App\n```\n\n### Show commands\n\nFor show commands, like `app show`, `env show`, and `svc show`, include as many details as is useful, but try to logically organize the information into sections. In those sections use whatever format makes the most sense - tables for data that will have multiple rows, or key/value for non-row-based data. In the example `svc show` call below, the command has three logical sections: `About`, `Configurations`, and `Routes`. 'About' uses a key/value layout to describe the svc, while 'Configurations' and 'Routes' use tables, as that data varies by environment.\n\n```\ncopilot svc show\nAbout\n  Application       ecs-kudos\n  Name              api\n  Type              Load Balanced Web App\n\nConfigurations\n  Environment       Tasks               CPU (vCPU)          Memory (MiB)        Platform          Port\n  test              1                   0.25                512                 LINUX/X86_64      80\n\nRoutes\n  Environment       URL                                                              Path\n  test              ecs-k-Publi-1Q9VOJGS3OQG1-100102515.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com  *\n```\n\nPrefer high-level summaries in show commands, rather than comprehensive views. Hiding less frequently useful data behind flags helps to not overwhelm users.\n\n### Progress\nCommands that perform actions (mutations) should write their updates to `stderr`.\nNon-instantaneous operations must provide a signal to the user that it’s not stuck and still making progress on the task.\n\nUse a spinner with a short text for short processes less than 4 seconds.\n\nFor long operations, use a spinner and display sub-tasks with status updates if the operation is going to take more than 4 seconds.\nPrefer listing all sub-tasks up front.\n![task-progress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879348/65549555-9ffa7300-ded2-11e9-955f-fa842263fb99.gif)\n\nOtherwise, display them sequentially over time.\n![sequential-task-progress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879348/65549577-abe63500-ded2-11e9-988b-00be9e770c85.gif)\n\n### Recommended actions\nCommands that are missing prerequisites should suggest other commands to run prior to invocation. For example:\n```\n$ copilot svc init\n✘ could not find an application attached to this workspace, please run `app init` first\n```\n\nCommands that perform actions successfully should suggest additional steps to follow. For example:\n```\n$ copilot svc init -n frontend -t \"Load Balanced Web Service\" -d ./frontend/Dockerfile\n✔ Success! Wrote the manifest for service frontend at 'copilot/frontend/manifest.yml'\n\nRecommended follow-up actions:\n- Update your manifest copilot/frontend/manifest.yml to change the defaults.\n```\n\n### Errors\nFailure messages should be written to `stderr`.\n\n```\n✘ Failed! could not create directory \"copilot\": no permissions\n```\n\nWrap external dependency errors to display errors as: `{what happened}: {why it happened}`\n\n## Acknowledgments\nThanks to the following resources for their inspiration:\n* [Heroku CLI’s style guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cli-style-guide).\n* Carolyn Van Slyck’s [Designing Command-Line Tools People Love](https://carolynvanslyck.com/talk/go/cli/#/) talk.\n"
