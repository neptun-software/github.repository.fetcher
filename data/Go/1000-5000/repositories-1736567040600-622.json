Future releases will add support for additional databases.\n\n![jet](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/image/jet.png)  \nJet is the easiest, and the fastest way to write complex type-safe SQL queries as a Go code and map database query result \ninto complex object composition. __It is not an ORM.__ \n\n## Motivation\nhttps://medium.com/@go.jet/jet-5f3667efa0cc\n\n## Contents\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n  - [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n     - [Generate sql builder and model types](#generate-sql-builder-and-model-types)\n     - [Lets write some SQL queries in Go](#lets-write-some-sql-queries-in-go)\n     - [Execute query and store result](#execute-query-and-store-result)\n- [Benefits](#benefits)\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n- [Versioning](#versioning)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Features\n 1) Auto-generated type-safe SQL Builder. Statements supported:\n    * [SELECT](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/SELECT) `(DISTINCT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET, FOR, LOCK_IN_SHARE_MODE, UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, WINDOW, sub-queries)`\n    * [INSERT](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/INSERT) `(VALUES, MODEL, MODELS, QUERY, ON_CONFLICT/ON_DUPLICATE_KEY_UPDATE, RETURNING)`, \n    * [UPDATE](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/UPDATE) `(SET, MODEL, WHERE, RETURNING)`, \n    * [DELETE](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/DELETE) `(WHERE, ORDER_BY, LIMIT, RETURNING)`,\n    * [LOCK](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/LOCK) `(IN, NOWAIT)`, `(READ, WRITE)`\n    * [WITH](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/WITH)\n    \n 2) Auto-generated Data Model types - Go types mapped to database type (table, view or enum), used to store\n result of database queries. Can be combined to create complex query result destination. \n 3) Query execution with result mapping to arbitrary destination. \n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo install Jet package, you need to install Go and set your Go workspace first.\n\n[Go](https://golang.org/) **version 1.18+ is required**\n\n### Installation\n\nUse the command bellow to add jet as a dependency into `go.mod` project:\n```sh\n$ go get -u github.com/go-jet/jet/v2\n```\n\nJet generator can be installed in one of the following ways:\n\n- (Go1.16+) Install jet generator using go install:\n```sh\ngo install github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/cmd/jet@latest\n```\n*Jet generator is installed to the directory named by the GOBIN environment variable,\nwhich defaults to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin if the GOPATH environment variable is not set.*\n\n- Install jet generator to specific folder:\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/go-jet/jet.git\ncd jet && go build -o dir_path ./cmd/jet\n```\n*Make sure `dir_path` folder is added to the PATH environment variable.*\n\n\n\n### Quick Start\nFor this quick start example we will use PostgreSQL sample _'dvd rental'_ database. Full database dump can be found in\n[./tests/testdata/init/postgres/dvds.sql](https://github.com/go-jet/jet-test-data/blob/master/init/postgres/dvds.sql).\nSchema diagram of interest can be found [here](./examples/quick-start/diagram.png).\n\n#### Generate SQL Builder and Model types\nTo generate jet SQL Builder and Data Model types from running postgres database, we need to call `jet` generator with postgres \nconnection parameters and destination folder path. \nAssuming we are running local postgres database, with user `user`, user password `pass`, database `jetdb` and \nschema `dvds` we will use this command:\n```sh\njet -dsn=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/jetdb?sslmode=disable -schema=dvds -path=./.gen\n```\n```sh\nConnecting to postgres database: postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/jetdb?sslmode=disable \nRetrieving schema information...\n\tFOUND 15 table(s), 7 view(s), 1 enum(s)\nCleaning up destination directory...\nGenerating table sql builder files...\nGenerating view sql builder files...\nGenerating enum sql builder files...\nGenerating table model files...\nGenerating view model files...\nGenerating enum model files...\nDone\n```\nProcedure is similar for MySQL, CockroachDB, MariaDB and SQLite. For example:\n```sh\njet -source=mysql -dsn=\"user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/dbname\" -path=./.gen\njet -dsn=postgres://user:pass@localhost:26257/jetdb?sslmode=disable -schema=dvds -path=./.gen  #cockroachdb\njet -dsn=\"mariadb://user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/dvds\" -path=./.gen              # source flag can be omitted if data source appears in dsn\njet -source=sqlite -dsn=\"/path/to/sqlite/database/file\" -schema=dvds -path=./.gen\njet -dsn=\"file:///path/to/sqlite/database/file\" -schema=dvds -path=./.gen         # sqlite database assumed for 'file' data sources\n```\n_*User has to have a permission to read information schema tables._\n\nAs command output suggest, Jet will:\n- connect to postgres database and retrieve information about the _tables_, _views_ and _enums_ of `dvds` schema\n- delete everything in schema destination folder -  `./.gen/jetdb/dvds`,   \n- and finally generate SQL Builder and Model types for each schema table, view and enum.  \n\n\nGenerated files folder structure will look like this:\n```sh \n|-- .gen                              # path\n|   -- jetdb                          # database name\n|       -- dvds                       # schema name\n|           |-- enum                  # sql builder package for enums\n|           |   |-- mpaa_rating.go\n|           |-- table                 # sql builder package for tables\n|               |-- actor.go\n|               |-- address.go\n|               |-- category.go\n|               ...\n|           |-- view                  # sql builder package for views\n|               |-- actor_info.go\n|               |-- film_list.go\n|               ...\n|           |-- model                 # data model types for each table, view and enum\n|           |   |-- actor.go\n|           |   |-- address.go\n|           |   |-- mpaa_rating.go\n|           |   ...\n```\nTypes from `table`, `view` and `enum` are used to write type safe SQL in Go, and `model` types are combined to store \nresults of the SQL queries.\n\n\n\n#### Let's write some SQL queries in Go\n\nFirst we need to import postgres SQLBuilder and generated packages from the previous step:\n```go\nimport (\n\t// dot import so go code would resemble as much as native SQL\n\t// dot import is not mandatory\n\t. \"github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/examples/quick-start/.gen/jetdb/dvds/table\"\n\t. \"github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/postgres\"\n\n\t\"github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/examples/quick-start/.gen/jetdb/dvds/model\"\n)\n```\nLet's say we want to retrieve the list of all _actors_ that acted in _films_ longer than 180 minutes, _film language_ is 'English' \nand _film category_ is not 'Action'.  \n```golang\nstmt := SELECT(\n    Actor.ActorID, Actor.FirstName, Actor.LastName, Actor.LastUpdate,  // or just Actor.AllColumns\n    Film.AllColumns,                                                  \n    Language.AllColumns.Except(Language.LastUpdate),  // all language columns except last_update \n    Category.AllColumns,\n).FROM(\n    Actor.\n        INNER_JOIN(FilmActor, Actor.ActorID.EQ(FilmActor.ActorID)).  \n        INNER_JOIN(Film, Film.FilmID.EQ(FilmActor.FilmID)).          \n        INNER_JOIN(Language, Language.LanguageID.EQ(Film.LanguageID)).\n        INNER_JOIN(FilmCategory, FilmCategory.FilmID.EQ(Film.FilmID)).\n        INNER_JOIN(Category, Category.CategoryID.EQ(FilmCategory.CategoryID)),\n).WHERE(\n    Language.Name.EQ(Char(20)(\"English\")).             \n        AND(Category.Name.NOT_EQ(Text(\"Action\"))).  \n        AND(Film.Length.GT(Int32(180))),               \n).ORDER_BY(\n    Actor.ActorID.ASC(),\n    Film.FilmID.ASC(),\n)\n```\n_Package(dot) import is used, so the statements look as close as possible to the native SQL._  \nNote that every column has a type. String column `Language.Name` and `Category.Name` can be compared only with \nstring columns and expressions. `Actor.ActorID`, `FilmActor.ActorID`, `Film.Length` are integer columns \nand can be compared only with integer columns and expressions.\n\n__How to get a parametrized SQL query from the statement?__\n```go\nquery, args := stmt.Sql()\n```\nquery - parametrized query  \nargs - query parameters \n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to see `query` and `args`</summary>\n  \n```sql\nSELECT actor.actor_id AS \"actor.actor_id\",\n       actor.first_name AS \"actor.first_name\",\n       actor.last_name AS \"actor.last_name\",\n       actor.last_update AS \"actor.last_update\",\n       film.film_id AS \"film.film_id\",\n       film.title AS \"film.title\",\n       film.description AS \"film.description\",\n       film.release_year AS \"film.release_year\",\n       film.language_id AS \"film.language_id\",\n       film.rental_duration AS \"film.rental_duration\",\n       film.rental_rate AS \"film.rental_rate\",\n       film.length AS \"film.length\",\n       film.replacement_cost AS \"film.replacement_cost\",\n       film.rating AS \"film.rating\",\n       film.last_update AS \"film.last_update\",\n       film.special_features AS \"film.special_features\",\n       film.fulltext AS \"film.fulltext\",\n       language.language_id AS \"language.language_id\",\n       language.name AS \"language.name\",\n       language.last_update AS \"language.last_update\",\n       category.category_id AS \"category.category_id\",\n       category.name AS \"category.name\",\n       category.last_update AS \"category.last_update\"\nFROM dvds.actor\n         INNER JOIN dvds.film_actor ON (actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id)\n         INNER JOIN dvds.film ON (film.film_id = film_actor.film_id)\n         INNER JOIN dvds.language ON (language.language_id = film.language_id)\n         INNER JOIN dvds.film_category ON (film_category.film_id = film.film_id)\n         INNER JOIN dvds.category ON (category.category_id = film_category.category_id)\nWHERE ((language.name = $1::char(20)) AND (category.name != $2::text)) AND (film.length > $3::integer)\nORDER BY actor.actor_id ASC, film.film_id ASC;\n```\n```sh \n[English Action 180]\n```\n\n\n</details>\n    \n__How to get debug SQL from statement?__  \n ```go\ndebugSql := stmt.DebugSql()\n```\ndebugSql - this query string can be copy-pasted to sql editor and executed. __It is not intended to be used in production.

Let's see how can we make some sense of result set returned executing \nabove statement. Usually this is the most complex and tedious work, but with Jet it is the easiest.\n\nFirst we have to create desired structure to store query result. \nThis is done be combining autogenerated model types, or it can be done \nby combining custom model types(see [wiki](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/Query-Result-Mapping-(QRM)#custom-model-types) for more information).  \n\n_Note that it's possible to overwrite default jet generator behavior. All the aspects of generated model and SQLBuilder types can be \ntailor-made([wiki](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki/Generator#generator-customization))._\n\nLet's say this is our desired structure made of autogenerated types:  \n```go\nvar dest []struct {\n    model.Actor\n    \n    Films []struct {\n        model.Film\n        \n        Language    model.Language\n        Categories  []model.Category\n    }\n}\n```\n`Films` field is a slice because one actor can act in multiple films, and because each film belongs to one language\n`Langauge` field is just a single model struct. `Film` can belong to multiple categories.  \n_*There is no limitation of how big or nested destination can be._\n\nNow let's execute above statement on open database connection (or transaction) db and store result into `dest`.\n\n```go\nerr := stmt.Query(db, &dest)\nhandleError(err)\n```\n\n__And that's it.__\n  \n`dest` now contains the list of all actors(with list of films acted, where each film has information about language and list of belonging categories) that acted in films longer than 180 minutes, film language is 'English' \nand film category is not 'Action'.\n\nLets print `dest` as a json to see:\n```go\njsonText, _ := json.MarshalIndent(dest, \"\", \"\\t\")\nfmt.Println(string(jsonText))\n```\n\n```js\n[\n\t{\n\t\t\"ActorID\": 1,\n\t\t\"FirstName\":

[./examples/quick-start/quick-start.go](./examples/quick-start/quick-start.go)\n\n\nThis example represent probably the most common use case.  Detail info about additional statements, features and use cases can be \nfound at project [Wiki](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki) page.\n\n## Benefits\n\nWhat are the benefits of writing SQL in Go using Jet?  \nThe biggest benefit is speed. Speed is being improved in 3 major areas:\n\n##### Speed of development  \n\nWriting SQL queries is faster and easier, as developers will have help of SQL code completion and SQL type safety directly from Go code.\nAutomatic scan to arbitrary structure removes a lot of headache and boilerplate code needed to structure database query result.  \n\n##### Speed of execution\n\nWhile ORM libraries can introduce significant performance penalties due to number of round-trips to the database(N+1 query problem), \n`jet` will always perform better as developers can write complex query and retrieve result with a single database call. \nThus handler time lost on latency between server and database can be constant. Handler execution will be proportional \nonly to the query complexity and the number of rows returned from database. \n\nWith Jet, it is even possible to join the whole database and store the whole structured result in one database call. \nThis is exactly what is being done in one of the tests: [TestJoinEverything](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/blob/6706f4b228f51cf810129f57ba90bbdb60b85fe7/tests/postgres/chinook_db_test.go#L187). \nThe whole test database is joined and query result(~10,000 rows) is stored in a structured variable in less than 0.5s. \n\n##### How quickly bugs are found\n\nThe most expensive bugs are the one discovered on the production, and the least expensive are those found during development.\nWith automatically generated type safe SQL, not only queries are written faster but bugs are found sooner.  \nLet's return to quick start example, and take closer look at a line:\n ```go\nAND(Film.Length.GT(Int32(180))),\n```\nLet's say someone changes column `length` to `duration` from `film` table. The next go build will fail at that line, and \nthe bug will be caught at compile time.\n\nLet's say someone changes the type of `length` column to some non-integer type. Build will also fail at the same line\nbecause integer columns and expressions can be only compared to other integer columns and expressions.\n\nBuild will also fail if someone removes `length` column from `film` table. `Film` field will be omitted from SQL Builder and Model types, \nnext time `jet` generator is run.\n\nWithout Jet these bugs will have to be either caught by tests or by manual testing. \n\n## Dependencies\nAt the moment Jet dependence only of:\n- `github.com/lib/pq` _(Used by jet generator to read `PostgreSQL` database information)_\n- `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` _(Used by jet generator to read `MySQL` and `MariaDB` database information)_\n- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` _(Used by jet generator to read `SQLite` database information)_ \n- `github.com/google/uuid` _(Used in data model files and for debug purposes)_\n  \nTo run the tests, additional dependencies are required:\n- `github.com/pkg/profile`\n- `github.com/stretchr/testify`\n- `github.com/google/go-cmp`\n- `github.com/jackc/pgx/v4`\n- `github.com/shopspring/decimal`\n- `github.com/volatiletech/null/v8`\n\n## Versioning\n\n[SemVer](http://semver.org/) is used for versioning. For the versions available, take a look at the [releases](https://github.com/go-jet/jet/releases).  \n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2019-2024 Goran Bjelanovic  \nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\n"

Future releases will add support for additional databases.\n\n# Installation\n\nUse the command bellow to add jet as a dependency into go.mod project:\n\n\t$ go get -u github.com/go-jet/jet/v2\n\nJet generator can be installed in one of the following ways:\n\n 1. (Go1.16+) Install jet generator using go install:\n    go install github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/cmd/jet@latest\n\n 2. Install jet generator to GOPATH/bin folder:\n    cd $GOPATH/src/ && GO111MODULE=off go get -u github.com/go-jet/jet/cmd/jet\n\n 3. Install jet generator into specific folder:\n    git clone https://github.com/go-jet/jet.git\n    cd jet && go build -o dir_path ./cmd/jet\n\nMake sure that the destination folder is added to the PATH environment variable.\n\n# Usage\n\nJet requires already defined database schema(with tables, enums etc), so that jet generator can generate SQL Builder\nand Model files. File generation is very fast, and can be added as every pre-build step.\nSample command:\n\n\tjet -dsn=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/jetdb -schema=dvds -path=./.gen\n\nBefore we can write SQL queries in Go, we need to import generated SQL builder and model types:\n\n\timport . \"some_path/.gen/jetdb/dvds/table\"\n\timport \"some_path/.gen/jetdb/dvds/model\"\n\nTo write postgres SQL queries we import:\n\n\t. \"github.com/go-jet/jet/v2/postgres\" // Dot import is used so that Go code resemble as much as native SQL. It is not mandatory.\n\nThen we can write the SQL query:\n\n\t// sub-query\n\trRatingFilms :=\n\t\tSELECT(\n\t\t\tFilm.FilmID,\n\t\t\tFilm.Title,\n\t\t\tFilm.Rating,\n\t\t).FROM(\n\t\t\tFilm,\n\t\t).WHERE(\n\t\t\tFilm.Rating.EQ(enum.FilmRating.R),\n\t\t).AsTable(\"rFilms\")\n\n\t// export column from sub-query\n\trFilmID := Film.FilmID.From(rRatingFilms)\n\n\t// main-query\n\tstmt :=\n\t\tSELECT(\n\t\t\tActor.AllColumns,\n\t\t\tFilmActor.AllColumns,\n\t\t\trRatingFilms.AllColumns(),\n\t\t).FROM(\n\t\t\trRatingFilms.\n\t\t\t\tINNER_JOIN(FilmActor, FilmActor.FilmID.EQ(rFilmID)).\n\t\t\t\tINNER_JOIN(Actor, Actor.ActorID.EQ(FilmActor.ActorID)\n\t\t).ORDER_BY(\n\t\t\trFilmID,\n\t\t\tActor.ActorID,\n\t\t)\n\nNow we can run the statement and store the result into desired destination:\n\n\tvar dest []struct {\n\t\tmodel.Film\n\n\t\tActors []model.Actor\n\t}\n\n\terr := stmt.Query(db, &dest)\n\nWe can print a statement to see SQL query and arguments sent to postgres server:\n\n\tfmt.Println(stmt.Sql())\n\nOutput:\n\n\tSELECT \"rFilms\".\"film.film_id\" AS \"film.film_id\",\n\t\t \"rFilms\".\"film.title\" AS \"film.title\",\n\t\t \"rFilms\".\"film.rating\" AS \"film.rating\",\n\t\t actor.actor_id AS \"actor.actor_id\",\n\t\t actor.first_name AS \"actor.first_name\",\n\t\t actor.last_name AS \"actor.last_name\",\n\t\t actor.last_update AS \"actor.last_update\",\n\t\t film_actor.actor_id AS \"film_actor.actor_id\",\n\t\t film_actor.film_id AS \"film_actor.film_id\",\n\t\t film_actor.last_update AS \"film_actor.last_update\"\n\tFROM (\n\t\t\t  SELECT film.film_id AS \"film.film_id\",\n\t\t\t\t   film.title AS \"film.title\",\n\t\t\t\t   film.rating AS \"film.rating\"\n\t\t\t  FROM dvds.film\n\t\t\t  WHERE film.rating = 'R'\n\t\t ) AS \"rFilms\"\n\t\t INNER JOIN dvds.film_actor ON (film_actor.film_id = \"rFilms\".\"film.film_id\")\n\t\t INNER JOIN dvds.actor ON (film_actor.actor_id = actor.actor_id)\n\tWHERE \"rFilms\".\"film.film_id\" < $1\n\tORDER BY \"rFilms\".\"film.film_id\" ASC, actor.actor_id ASC;\n\t [50]\n\nIf we print destination as json, we'll get:\n\n\t[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"FilmID\": 8,\n\t\t\t\"Title\": \"Airport Pollock\",\n\t\t\t\"Rating\": \"R\",\n\t\t\t\"Actors\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"ActorID\": 55,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"FirstName\": \"Fay\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"LastName\": \"Kilmer\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"LastUpdate\": \"2013-05-26T14:47:57.62Z\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"ActorID\": 96,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"FirstName\": \"Gene\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"LastName\": \"Willis\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"LastUpdate\": \"2013-05-26T14:47:57.62Z\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"FilmID\": 17,\n\t\t\t\"Title\": \"Alone Trip\",\n\t\t\t\"Actors\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"ActorID\": 3,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"FirstName\": \"Ed\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"LastName\": \"Chase\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"LastUpdate\": \"2013-05-26T14:47:57.62Z\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"ActorID\": 12,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"FirstName\": \"Karl\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"LastName\": \"Berry\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"LastUpdate\": \"2013-05-26T14:47:57.62Z\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t...\n\t]\n\nDetail info about all statements, features and use cases can be\nfound at project wiki page - https://github.com/go-jet/jet/wiki.\n*/\npackage jet\n"
