          "content": "# Kubernetes Contrib\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kubernetes/contrib.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kubernetes/contrib)\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/kubernetes/contrib)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/kubernetes/contrib)\n[![APACHEv2 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-APACHEv2-blue.svg)](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n**Do not add new projects to this repository.** We eventually want to\nmove all code in this repository to more appropriate repositories (see \n[#762](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/issues/762)). Create a new\nrepository in `kubernetes-incubator` instead \n([process](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/incubator.md)).\n\n## Getting the Code\n\nThe code must be checked out as a subdirectory of `k8s.io`, and not `github.com`.\n\n```shell\nmkdir -p $GOPATH/src/k8s.io\ncd $GOPATH/src/k8s.io\n# Replace \"$YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME\" below with your github username\ngit clone https://github.com/$YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/contrib.git\ncd contrib\n```\n\n## Updating Godeps\n\nGodeps in contrib/ has a different layout than in kubernetes/ proper. This is because\ncontrib contains multiple tiny projects, each with their own dependencies. Each\nin contrib/ has it's own Godeps.json. For example the Godeps.json for Ingress\nis Ingress/Godeps/Godeps.json. This means that godeps commands like `godep restore`\nor `godep test` do not work in the root directory. They should be run from inside the\nsubproject directory you want to test.\n\n## Prerequisites for updating Godeps\n\nSince we vendor godeps through `/vendor` vs the old style `Godeps/_workspace`, you either need a more recent install of go and godeps, or you need to set `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1`. Eg:\n```shell\n$ godep version\ngodep v74 (linux/amd64/go1.6.1)\n$ go version\ngo version go1.6.1 linux/amd64\n$ godep save ./...\n```\n\nWill automatically save godeps to `vendor/` instead of `_workspace/`.\nIf you have an older version of go, you must run:\n```shell\n$ GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1 godep save ./...\n```\n\nIf you have an older version of godep, you must update it:\n```shell\n$ go get github.com/tools/godep\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tools/godep\n$ go build -o godep *.go\n```\n\n## Updating Godeps\n\nThe most common dep to update is obviously going to be kubernetes proper. Updating\nkubernetes and it's dependancies in the Ingress subproject for example can be done\nas follows (the example assumes your Kubernetes repo is rooted at `$GOPATH/src/github.com/kubernetes`, `s/github.com\\/kubernetes/k8s.io/` as required):\n```shell\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kubernetes/contrib/ingress\ngodep restore\ngo get -u github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\ngodep restore\ncd $GOPATH/src/github/kubernetes/contrib/ingress\nrm -rf Godeps\ngodep save ./...\ngit [add/remove] as needed\ngit commit\n```\n\nOther deps are similar, although if the dep you wish to update is included from\nkubernetes we probably want to stay in sync using the above method. If the dep is not in kubernetes proper something like the following should get you a nice clean result:\n```shell\ncd $GOPATH/src/github/kubernetes/contrib/ingress\ngodep restore\ngo get -u $SOME_DEP\nrm -rf Godeps\ngodep save ./...\ngit [add/remove] as needed\ngit commit\n```\n\n## Running all tests\n\nTo run all go test in all projects do this:\n```shell\n./hack/for-go-proj.sh test\n```\n\n## Getting PRs Merged Into Contrib\n\nIn order for your PR to get merged, it must have the both `lgtm` AND `approved` labels.  When you open a PR, the k8s-merge-bot will automatically assign a reviewer from the `OWNERS` files.  Once assigned, the reviewer can then comment `/lgtm`, which will add the `lgtm` label, or if he/she has permission, the reviewer can add the label directly.\n\nEach file modified in the PR will also need to be approved by an approver from its `OWNERS` file or an approver in a parent directory's `OWNERS` file.  A file is approved when the approver comments `/approve`, and it is unapproved if an approver comments `/approve cancel`.  When all files have been approved, the `approved` label will automatically be added by the k8s-merge-bot and the PR will be added to the submit-queue to be merged.\n"
