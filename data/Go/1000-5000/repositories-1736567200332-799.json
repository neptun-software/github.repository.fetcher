In all cases, traffic between two clusters will\ntransit between the leader elected (in each cluster) gateway nodes, through the configured cable driver.\n\nWhen the source Pod is on a worker node that is not the elected gateway node, the traffic destined for the remote cluster will transit\nthrough the submariner VXLAN tunnel (`vx-submariner`) to the local cluster gateway node.\nOn the gateway node, traffic is forwarded to the remote cluster over the configured tunnel.\nOnce the traffic reaches the destination gateway node, it is routed in one of two ways,\ndepending on the destination CIDR. If the destination CIDR is a Pod network, the traffic is routed via CNI-programmed network. If the\ndestination CIDR is a Service network, then traffic is routed through the facility configured via kube-proxy on the destination gateway\nnode.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nSee the [Prerequisites docs](https://submariner.io/getting-started/#prerequisites) on Submariner's website.\n\n## Installation\n\nSubmariner is always deployed using a Go-based Kubernetes custom controller, called an\n[Operator](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner-operator), that provides API-based installation and management. Deployment tools like\nthe *`subctl`* command line utility and Helm charts wrap the Operator. The recommended deployment method is `subctl`, as it is currently the\ndefault in CI and provides diagnostic features.\n\nSee the [Deplyment docs](https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/) on Submariner's website.\n\n### Installation using subctl\n\nSubmariner provides the `subctl` CLI utility to simplify the deployment and maintenance of Submariner across your clusters.\n\nSee the [`subctl` Deployment docs](https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/) on Submariner's website.\n\n### Installation using Helm\n\nSee the [Helm Deployment docs](https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/helm/) on Submariner's website.\n\n### Validate Submariner is Working\n\nSee the [`subctl verify` docs](https://submariner.io/operations/deployment/subctl/#verify) and [Automated\nTroubleshooting docs](https://submariner.io/operations/troubleshooting/#automated-troubleshooting) on Submariner's website.\n\n## Building and Testing\n\nSee the [Building and Testing docs](https://submariner.io/development/building-testing/) on Submariner's website.\n\n## Known Issues\n\nSee the [Known Issues docs](https://submariner.io/operations/known-issues/) on Submariner's website.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [Development section](https://submariner.io/development/) of Submariner's website.\n"
