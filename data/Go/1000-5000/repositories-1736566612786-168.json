          "content": "# Changelog\n\n## main / unreleased\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: OTLP and push handler replace all non-UTF8 characters with the unicode replacement character `\\uFFFD` in error messages before propagating them. #10236\n* [CHANGE] Querier: pass query matchers to queryable `IsApplicable` hook. #10256\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: Add `topic` label to `cortex_ingest_storage_strong_consistency_requests_total`, `cortex_ingest_storage_strong_consistency_failures_total`, and `cortex_ingest_storage_strong_consistency_wait_duration_seconds` metrics. #10220\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: cap the rate of retries for remote query evaluation to 170/sec. This is configurable via `-ruler.query-frontend.max-retries-rate`. #10375 #10403\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query Frontend: Return server-side `samples_processed` statistics. #10103\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: OTLP receiver now converts also metric metadata. See also https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15416. #10168\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: discard float and histogram samples with duplicated timestamps from each timeseries in a request before the request is forwarded to ingesters. Discarded samples are tracked by the `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metrics with reason `sample_duplicate_timestamp`. #10145\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add `cortex_prometheus_rule_group_last_rule_duration_sum_seconds` metric to track the total evaluation duration of a rule group regardless of concurrency #10189\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add native histogram support for `electedReplicaPropagationTime` metric in ha_tracker. #10264\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: More efficient CPU/memory utilization-based read request limiting. #10325\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Add Query-Scheduler <-> Querier Inflight Requests row to Query Reads and Remote Ruler reads dashboards. #10290\n* [ENHANCEMENT] OTLP: In addition to the flag `-distributor.otel-created-timestamp-zero-ingestion-enabled` there is now `-distributor.otel-start-time-quiet-zero` to convert OTel start timestamps to Prometheus QuietZeroNaNs. This flag is to make the change rollout safe between Ingesters and Distributors. #10238\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: When rule concurrency is enabled for a rule group, its rules will now be reordered and run in batches based on their dependencies. This increases the number of rules that can potentially run concurrently. Note that the global and tenant-specific limits still apply #10400\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: Use a boolean to track changes while merging the ReplicaDesc components, rather than comparing the objects directly. #10185\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fix timeout responding to query-frontend when response size is very close to `-querier.frontend-client.grpc-max-send-msg-size`. #10154\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend and querier: show warning/info annotations in some cases where they were missing (if a lazy querier was used). #10277\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix indeterminate rules being always run concurrently (instead of never) when `-ruler.max-independent-rule-evaluation-concurrency` is set. https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15560 #10258\n* [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix various UTF-8 bugs related to quoting. https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15531 #10258\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Fixed an issue when using the experimental `-ruler.max-independent-rule-evaluation-concurrency` feature, where if a rule group was eligible for concurrency, it would flap between running concurrently or not based on the time it took after running concurrently. #9726 #10189\n* [BUGFIX] Mimirtool: `remote-read` commands will now return data. #10286\n* [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix deriv, predict_linear and double_exponential_smoothing with histograms https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15686 #10383\n* [BUGFIX] MQE: Fix deriv with histograms #10383\n* [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix <aggr_over_time> functions with histograms https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15711 #10400\n* [BUGFIX] MQE: Fix <aggr_over_time> functions with histograms #10400\n\n### Mixin\n\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: fix how we switch between classic and native histograms. #10018\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Ignore cache errors performing `delete` operations since these are expected to fail when keys don't exist. #10287\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] Update rollout-operator version to 0.22.0. #10229\n* [CHANGE] Memcached: Update to Memcached 1.6.34. #10318\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Enforce `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy` `Retain` policy on partition ingesters during migration to experimental ingest storage. #10395\n* [BUGFIX] Ports in container rollout-operator. #10273\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [BUGFIX] Fix issue where `MIMIR_HTTP_PREFIX` environment variable was ignored and the value from `MIMIR_MIMIR_HTTP_PREFIX` was used instead. #10207\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Unify mimirtool authentication options and add extra-headers support for commands that depend on MimirClient. #10178\n\n### Mimir Continuous Test\n\n### Query-tee\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [CHANGE] Add production tips related to cache size, heavy multi-tenancy and latency spikes. #9978\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update `MimirAutoscalerNotActive` and `MimirAutoscalerKedaFailing` runbooks, with an instruction to check whether Prometheus has enough CPU allocated. #10257\n\n### Tools\n\n* [CHANGE] `copyblocks`: Remove /pprof endpoint. #10329\n\n## 2.15.0\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: the following metrics are not exported for a given `user` when the metric value is zero: #9359\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_received_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_alerts_invalid_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_partial_state_merges_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_partial_state_merges_failed_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_replication_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_state_replication_failed_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_alerts`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_silences`\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: Drop experimental `-distributor.direct-otlp-translation-enabled` flag, since direct OTLP translation is well tested at this point. #9647\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Change `-initial-delay` for circuit breakers to begin when the first request is received, rather than at breaker activation. #9842\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: apply query pruning before query sharding instead of after. #9913\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: remove experimental flags `-ingest-storage.kafka.ongoing-records-per-fetch` and `-ingest-storage.kafka.startup-records-per-fetch`. They are removed in favour of `-ingest-storage.kafka.max-buffered-bytes`. #9906\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Replace `cortex_discarded_samples_total` label from `sample-out-of-bounds` to `sample-timestamp-too-old`. #9885\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: the `/prometheus/config/v1/rules` does not return an error anymore if a rule group is missing in the object storage after been successfully returned by listing the storage, because it could have been deleted in the meanwhile. #9936\n* [CHANGE] Querier: The `.` pattern in regular expressions in PromQL matches newline characters. With this change regular expressions like `.*` match strings that include `\\n`. To maintain the old behaviour, you will have to change regular expressions by replacing all `.` patterns with `[^\\n]`, e.g. `foo[^\\n]*`. This upgrades PromQL compatibility from Prometheus 2.0 to 3.0. #9844\n* [CHANGE] Querier: Lookback and range selectors are left open and right closed (previously left closed and right closed). This change affects queries and subqueries when the evaluation time perfectly aligns with the sample timestamps. For example assume querying a timeseries with evenly spaced samples exactly 1 minute apart. Previously, a range query with `5m` would usually return 5 samples, or 6 samples if the query evaluation aligns perfectly with a scrape. Now, queries like this will always return 5 samples. This upgrades PromQL compatibility from Prometheus 2.0 to 3.0. #9844 #10188\n* [CHANGE] Querier: promql(native histograms): Introduce exponential interpolation. #9844\n* [CHANGE] Remove deprecated `api.get-request-for-ingester-shutdown-enabled` setting, which scheduled for removal in 2.15. #10197\n* [FEATURE] Querier: add experimental streaming PromQL engine, enabled with `-querier.query-engine=mimir`. #10067\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Add support for `lz4` OTLP compression. #9763\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: added experimental configuration options `query-frontend.cache-errors` and `query-frontend.results-cache-ttl-for-errors` to allow non-transient responses to be cached. When set to `true` error responses from hitting limits or bad data are cached for a short TTL. #9028\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: add middleware to control access to specific PromQL experimental functions on a per-tenant basis. #9798\n* [FEATURE] gRPC: Support S2 compression. #9322\n  * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-compression=s2`\n  * `-ingester.client.grpc-compression=s2`\n  * `-querier.frontend-client.grpc-compression=s2`\n  * `-querier.scheduler-client.grpc-compression=s2`\n  * `-query-frontend.grpc-client-config.grpc-compression=s2`\n  * `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.grpc-compression=s2`\n  * `-ruler.client.grpc-compression=s2`\n  * `-ruler.query-frontend.grpc-client-config.grpc-compression=s2`\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: limit added for maximum size of the Grafana state (`-alertmanager.max-grafana-state-size-bytes`). #9475\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: limit added for maximum size of the Grafana configuration (`-alertmanager.max-config-size-bytes`). #9402\n* [FEATURE] Ingester: Experimental support for ingesting out-of-order native histograms. This is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting `-ingester.ooo-native-histograms-ingestion-enabled` to `true`. #7175\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Added `-api.skip-label-count-validation-header-enabled` option to allow skipping label count validation on the HTTP write path based on `X-Mimir-SkipLabelCountValidation` header being `true` or not. #9576\n* [FEATURE] Ruler: Add experimental support for caching the contents of rule groups. This is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting `-ruler-storage.cache.rule-group-enabled`. #9595 #10024\n* [FEATURE] PromQL: Add experimental `info` function. Experimental functions are disabled by default, but can be enabled setting `-querier.promql-experimental-functions-enabled=true` in the query-frontend and querier. #9879\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Support promotion of OTel resource attributes to labels. #8271\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Add experimental `double_exponential_smoothing` PromQL function. Experimental functions are disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `-querier.promql-experimental-functions-enabled=true` in the query-frontend and querier. #9844\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Add experimental `memberlist` KV store for ha_tracker. You can enable it using the `-distributor.ha-tracker.kvstore.store` flag. You can configure Memberlist parameters via the `-memberlist-*` flags. #10054\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Add experimental `-distributor.otel-keep-identifying-resource-attributes` option to allow keeping `service.instance.id`, `service.name` and `service.namespace` in `target_info` on top of converting them to the `instance` and `job` labels. #10216\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query Frontend: Return server-side `bytes_processed` statistics following Server-Timing format. #9645 #9985\n* [ENHANCEMENT] mimirtool: Adds bearer token support for mimirtool's analyze ruler/prometheus commands. #9587\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Support `exclude_alerts` parameter in `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/rules` endpoint. #9300\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: add a metric to track tenants who are sending newlines in their label values called `cortex_distributor_label_values_with_newlines_total`. #9400\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: improve performance of reading the WAL. #9508\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: improve the errors and traces emitted by query-schedulers when communicating with queriers. #9519\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: uploaded blocks cannot be bigger than max configured compactor time range, and cannot cross the boundary for given time range. #9524\n* [ENHANCEMENT] The distributor now validates that received label values only contain allowed characters. #9185\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add SASL plain authentication support to Kafka client used by the experimental ingest storage. Configure SASL credentials via the following settings: #9584\n  * `-ingest-storage.kafka.sasl-password`\n  * `-ingest-storage.kafka.sasl-username`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] memberlist: TCP transport write path is now non-blocking, and is configurable by new flags: #9594\n  * `-memberlist.max-concurrent-writes`\n  * `-memberlist.acquire-writer-timeout`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] memberlist: Notifications can now be processed once per interval specified by `-memberlist.notify-interval` to reduce notify storm CPU activity in large clusters. #9594\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: Remove the experimental `query-scheduler.prioritize-query-components` flag. Request queues always prioritize query component dequeuing above tenant fairness. #9703\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Emit traces for block syncing, to join up block-upload traces. #9656\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: Enable the optional querying of additional storage queryables. #9712\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Disable the push circuit breaker when ingester is in read-only mode. #9760\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Reduced lock contention in the `PostingsForMatchers` cache. #9773\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Storage: Allow HTTP client settings to be tuned for GCS and Azure backends via an `http` block or corresponding CLI flags. This was already supported by the S3 backend. #9778\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Support `group_limit` and `group_next_token` parameters in the `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/rules` endpoint. #9563\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: improved lock contention affecting read and write latencies during TSDB head compaction. #9822\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: when a label value fails validation due to invalid UTF-8 characters, don't include the invalid characters in the returned error. #9828\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: when experimental ingest storage is enabled, do not buffer records in the Kafka client when fetch concurrency is in use. #9838 #9850\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: refresh deletion marks when updating the bucket index concurrently. This speeds up updating the bucket index by up to 16 times when there is a lot of blocks churn (thousands of blocks churning every cleanup cycle). #9881\n* [ENHANCEMENT] PromQL: make `sort_by_label` stable. #9879\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Initialize ha_tracker cache before ha_tracker and distributor reach running state and begin serving writes. #9826 #9976\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: `-ingest-storage.kafka.max-buffered-bytes` to limit the memory for buffered records when using concurrent fetching. #9892\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: improve performance and memory consumption of queries that select many series. #9914\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Support OAuth2 and proxies in Alertmanager client #9945 #10030\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Add `-blocks-storage.tsdb.bigger-out-of-order-blocks-for-old-samples` to build 24h blocks for out-of-order data belonging to the previous days instead of building smaller 2h blocks. This reduces pressure on compactors and ingesters when the out-of-order samples span multiple days in the past. #9844 #10033 #10035\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: allow a different limit for info series (series ending in `_info`) label count, via `-validation.max-label-names-per-info-series`. #10028\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: do not reuse labels, samples and histograms slices in the write request if there are more entries than 10x the pre-allocated size. This should help to reduce the in-use memory in case of few requests with a very large number of labels, samples or histograms. #10040\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-Frontend: prune `<subquery> and on() (vector(x)==y)` style queries and stop pruning `<subquery> < -Inf`. Triggered by https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/15245. #10026\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-Frontend: perform request format validation before processing the request. #10093\n* [BUGFIX] Fix issue where functions such as `rate()` over native histograms could return incorrect values if a float stale marker was present in the selected range. #9508\n* [BUGFIX] Fix issue where negation of native histograms (eg. `-some_native_histogram_series`) did nothing. #9508\n* [BUGFIX] Fix issue where `metric might not be a counter, name does not end in _total/_sum/_count/_bucket` annotation would be emitted even if `rate` or `increase` did not have enough samples to compute a result. #9508\n* [BUGFIX] Fix issue where sharded queries could return annotations with incorrect or confusing position information. #9536\n* [BUGFIX] Fix issue where downstream consumers may not generate correct cache keys for experimental error caching. #9644\n* [BUGFIX] Fix issue where active series requests error when encountering a stale posting. #9580\n* [BUGFIX] Fix pooling buffer reuse logic when `-distributor.max-request-pool-buffer-size` is set. #9666\n* [BUGFIX] Fix issue when using the experimental `-ruler.max-independent-rule-evaluation-concurrency` feature, where the ruler could panic as it updates a running ruleset or shutdowns. #9726\n* [BUGFIX] Always return unknown hint for first sample in non-gauge native histograms chunk to avoid incorrect counter reset hints when merging chunks from different sources. #10033\n* [BUGFIX] Ensure native histograms counter reset hints are corrected when merging results from different sources. #9909\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Fix race condition in per-tenant TSDB creation. #9708\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Fix race condition in exemplar adding. #9765\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Fix race condition in native histogram appending. #9765\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Fix bug in concurrent fetching where a failure to list topics on startup would cause to use an invalid topic ID (0x00000000000000000000000000000000). #9883\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Fix data loss bug in the experimental ingest storage when a Kafka Fetch is split into multiple requests and some of them return an error. #9963 #9964\n* [BUGFIX] PromQL: `round` now removes the metric name again. #9879\n* [BUGFIX] Query-Frontend: fix `QueryFrontendCodec` module initialization to set lookback delta from

The default strategy is now `worst-case`. #8702\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Rename `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.series-selection-strategies.worst-case-series-preference` to `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.series-fetch-preference` and promote to stable. #8702\n* [CHANGE] Querier, store-gateway: remove deprecated `-querier.prefer-streaming-chunks-from-store-gateways=true`. Streaming from store-gateways is now always enabled. #8696\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: remove deprecated `-ingester.return-only-grpc-errors`. #8699 #8828\n* [CHANGE] Distributor, ruler: remove deprecated `-ingester.client.report-grpc-codes-in-instrumentation-label-enabled`. #8700\n* [CHANGE] Ingester client: experimental support for client-side circuit breakers, their configuration options (`-ingester.client.circuit-breaker.*`) and metrics (`cortex_ingester_client_circuit_breaker_results_total`, `cortex_ingester_client_circuit_breaker_transitions_total`) were removed. #8802\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: circuit breakers do not open in case of per-instance limit errors anymore. Opening can be triggered only in case of push and pull requests exceeding the configured duration. #8854\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: Return `413 Request Entity Too Large` if a response shard for an `/active_series` request is too large. #8861\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: Promote replying with `Retry-After` header on retryable errors to stable and set `-distributor.retry-after-header.enabled=true` by default. #8694\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: Replace `-distributor.retry-after-header.max-backoff-exponent` and `-distributor.retry-after-header.base-seconds` with `-distributor.retry-after-header.min-backoff` and `-distributor.retry-after-header.max-backoff` for easier configuration. #8694\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: increase the default inactivity timeout of active series (`-ingester.active-series-metrics-idle-timeout`) from `10m` to `20m`. #8975\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: Remove `-distributor.enable-otlp-metadata-storage` flag, which was deprecated in version 2.12. #9069\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: Removed `-ruler.drain-notification-queue-on-shutdown` option, which is now enabled by default. #9115\n* [CHANGE] Querier: allow wrapping errors with context errors only when the former actually correspond to `context.Canceled` and `context.DeadlineExceeded`. #9175\n* [CHANGE] Query-scheduler: Remove the experimental `-query-scheduler.use-multi-algorithm-query-queue` flag. The new multi-algorithm tree queue is always used for the scheduler. #9210\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: reject incoming requests until the distributor service has started. #9317\n* [CHANGE] Ingester, Distributor: Remove deprecated `-ingester.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter` and `-distributor.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter`. The feature was deprecated and enabled by default in Mimir 2.12. #9407\n* [CHANGE] Querier: Remove deprecated `-querier.max-query-into-future`. The feature was deprecated in Mimir 2.12. #9407\n* [CHANGE] Cache: Deprecate experimental support for Redis as a cache backend. The support is set to be removed in the next major release. #9453\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.log-parsing-label-matchers` to control logging when parsing label matchers. This flag is intended to be used with `-alertmanager.utf8-strict-mode-enabled` to validate UTF-8 strict mode is working as intended. The default value is `false`. #9173\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added `-alertmanager.utf8-migration-logging-enabled` to enable logging of tenant configurations that are incompatible with UTF-8 strict mode. The default value is `false`. #9174\n* [FEATURE] Querier: add experimental streaming PromQL engine, enabled with `-querier.query-engine=mimir`. #8422 #8430 #8454 #8455 #8360 #8490 #8508 #8577 #8660 #8671 #8677 #8747 #8850 #8872 #8838 #8911 #8909 #8923 #8924 #8925 #8932 #8933 #8934 #8962 #8986 #8993 #8995 #9008 #9017 #9018 #9019 #9120 #9121 #9136 #9139 #9140 #9145 #9191 #9192 #9194 #9196 #9201 #9212 #9225 #9260 #9272 #9277 #9278 #9280 #9281 #9342 #9343 #9371 #9859 #9858\n* [FEATURE] Experimental Kafka-based ingest storage. #6888 #6894 #6929 #6940 #6951 #6974 #6982 #7029 #7030 #7091 #7142 #7147 #7148 #7153 #7160 #7193 #7349 #7376 #7388 #7391 #7393 #7394 #7402 #7404 #7423 #7424 #7437 #7486 #7503 #7508 #7540 #7621 #7682 #7685 #7694 #7695 #7696 #7697 #7701 #7733 #7734 #7741 #7752 #7838 #7851 #7871 #7877 #7880 #7882 #7887 #7891 #7925 #7955 #7967 #8031 #8063 #8077 #8088 #8135 #8176 #8184 #8194 #8216 #8217 #8222 #8233 #8503 #8542 #8579 #8657 #8686 #8688 #8703 #8706 #8708 #8738 #8750 #8778 #8808 #8809 #8841 #8842 #8845 #8853 #8886 #8988\n  * What it is:\n    * When the new ingest storage architecture is enabled, distributors write incoming write requests to a Kafka-compatible backend, and the ingesters asynchronously replay ingested data from Kafka. In this architecture, the write and read path are de-coupled through a Kafka-compatible backend. The write path and Kafka load is a function of the incoming write traffic, the read path load is a function of received queries. Whatever the load on the read path, it doesn't affect the write path.\n  * New configuration options:\n    * `-ingest-storage.enabled`\n    * `-ingest-storage.kafka.*`: configures Kafka-compatible backend and how clients interact with it.\n    * `-ingest-storage.ingestion-partition-tenant-shard-size`: configures the per-tenant shuffle-sharding shard size used by partitions ring.\n    * `-ingest-storage.read-consistency`: configures the default read consistency.\n    * `-ingest-storage.migration.distributor-send-to-ingesters-enabled`: enabled tee-ing writes to classic ingesters and Kafka, used during a live migration to the new ingest storage architecture.\n    * `-ingester.partition-ring.*`: configures partitions ring backend.\n* [FEATURE] Querier: added support for `limitk()` and `limit_ratio()` experimental PromQL functions. Experimental functions are disabled by default, but can be enabled setting `-querier.promql-experimental-functions-enabled=true` in the query-frontend and querier. #8632\n* [FEATURE] Querier: experimental support for `X-Mimir-Chunk-Info-Logger` header that triggers logging information about TSDB chunks loaded from ingesters and store-gateways in the querier. The header should contain the comma separated list of labels for which their value will be included in the logs. #8599\n* [FEATURE] Query frontend: added new query pruning middleware to enable pruning dead code (eg. expressions that cannot produce any results) and simplifying expressions (eg. expressions that can be evaluated immediately) in queries. #9086\n* [FEATURE] Ruler: added experimental configuration, `-ruler.rule-evaluation-write-enabled`, to disable writing the result of rule evaluation to ingesters. This feature can be used for testing purposes. #9060\n* [FEATURE] Ingester: added experimental configuration `ingester.ignore-ooo-exemplars`. When set to `true` out of order exemplars are no longer reported to the remote write client. #9151\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Add `cortex_compactor_compaction_job_duration_seconds` and `cortex_compactor_compaction_job_blocks` histogram metrics to track duration of individual compaction jobs and number of blocks per job. #8371\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Added per namespace max rules per rule group limit. The maximum number of rules per rule groups for all namespaces continues to be configured by `-ruler.max-rules-per-rule-group`, but now, this can be superseded by the new `-ruler.max-rules-per-rule-group-by-namespace` option on a per namespace basis. This new limit can be overridden using the overrides mechanism to be applied per-tenant. #8378\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Added per namespace max rule groups per tenant limit. The maximum number of rule groups per rule tenant for all namespaces continues to be configured by `-ruler.max-rule-groups-per-tenant`, but now, this can be superseded by the new `-ruler.max-rule-groups-per-tenant-by-namespace` option on a per namespace basis. This new limit can be overridden using the overrides mechanism to be applied per-tenant. #8425\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Added support to protect rules namespaces from modification. The `-ruler.protected-namespaces` flag can be used to specify namespaces that are protected from rule modifications. The header `X-Mimir-Ruler-Override-Namespace-Protection` can be used to override the protection. #8444\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: be able to block remote read queries via the per tenant runtime override `blocked_queries`. #8372 #8415\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: added `remote_read` to `op` supported label values for the `cortex_query_frontend_queries_total` metric. #8412\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: log the overall length and start, end time offset from current time for remote read requests. The start and end times are calculated as the miminum and maximum times of the individual queries in the remote read request. #8404\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Storage Provider: Added option `-<prefix>.s3.dualstack-enabled` that allows disabling S3 client from resolving AWS S3 endpoint into dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 endpoint. Defaults to true. #8405\n* [ENHANCEMENT] HA Tracker: Added reporting of most recent elected replica change via `cortex_ha_tracker_last_election_timestamp_seconds` gauge, logging, and a new column in the HA Tracker status page. #8507\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Use sd_notify to send events to systemd at start and stop of mimir services. Default systemd mimir.service config now wait for those events with a configurable timeout `TimeoutStartSec` default is 3 min to handle long start time (ex. store-gateway). #8220 #8555 #8658\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Reloading config and templates no longer needs to hit the disk. #4967\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Added experimental `-compactor.in-memory-tenant-meta-cache-size` option to set size of in-memory cache (in number of items) for parsed meta.json files. This can help when a tenant has many meta.json files and their parsing before each compaction cycle is using a lot of CPU time. #8544\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Interrupt OTLP write request translation when context is canceled or has timed out. #8524\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester, store-gateway: optimised regular expression matching for patterns like `1.*|2.*|3.*|...|1000.*`. #8632\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Add `header_cache_control` to query stats. #8590\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: Introduce `query-scheduler.use-multi-algorithm-query-queue`, which allows use of an experimental queue structure, with no change in external queue behavior. #7873\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: Improve CPU/memory performance of experimental query-scheduler. #8871\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Expose a new `s3.trace.enabled` configuration option to enable detailed logging of operations against S3-compatible object stores. #8690\n* [ENHANCEMENT] memberlist: locally-generated messages (e.g. ring updates) are sent to gossip network before forwarded messages. Introduced `-memberlist.broadcast-timeout-for-local-updates-on-shutdown` option to modify how long to wait until queue with locally-generated messages is empty when shutting down. Previously this was hard-coded to 10s, and wait included all messages (locally-generated and forwarded). Now it defaults to 10s, 0 means no timeout. Increasing this value may help to avoid problem when ring updates on shutdown are not propagated to other nodes, and ring entry is left in a wrong state. #8761\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: allow using both raw numbers of seconds and duration literals in queries where previously only one or the other was permitted. For example, `predict_linear` now accepts a duration literal (eg. `predict_linear(..., 4h)`), and range vector selectors now accept a number of seconds (eg. `rate(metric[2])`). #8780\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add `ruler.max-independent-rule-evaluation-concurrency` to allow independent rules of a tenant to be run concurrently. You can control the amount of concurrency per tenant is controlled via the `-ruler.max-independent-rule-evaluation-concurrency-per-tenan` as a limit. Use a `-ruler.max-independent-rule-evaluation-concurrency` value of `0` can be used to disable the feature for all tenants. By default, this feature is disabled. A rule is eligible for concurrency as long as it doesn't depend on any other rules, doesn't have any other rules that depend on it, and has a total rule group runtime that exceeds 50% of its interval by default. The threshold can can be adjusted with `-ruler.independent-rule-evaluation-concurrency-min-duration-percentage`. #8146 #8858 #8880 #8884\n  * This work introduces the following metrics:\n    * `cortex_ruler_independent_rule_evaluation_concurrency_slots_in_use`\n    * `cortex_ruler_independent_rule_evaluation_concurrency_attempts_started_total`\n    * `cortex_ruler_independent_rule_evaluation_concurrency_attempts_incomplete_total`\n    * `cortex_ruler_independent_rule_evaluation_concurrency_attempts_completed_total`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Expose a new `s3.session-token` configuration option to enable using temporary security credentials. #8952\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add HA deduplication features to the `mimir-microservices-mode` development environment. #9012\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Remove experimental `-query-frontend.additional-query-queue-dimensions-enabled` and `-query-scheduler.additional-query-queue-dimensions-enabled`. Mimir now always includes \"query components\" as a queue dimension. #8984 #9135\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add a new ingester endpoint to prepare instances to downscale. #8956\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: Add `query-scheduler.prioritize-query-components` which, when enabled, will primarily prioritize dequeuing fairly across queue components, and secondarily prioritize dequeuing fairly across tenants. When disabled, tenant fairness is primarily prioritized. `query-scheduler.use-multi-algorithm-query-queue` must be enabled in order to use this flag. #9016 #9071\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update runtime configuration to read gzip-compressed files with `.gz` extension. #9074\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: add `cortex_lifecycler_read_only` metric which is set to 1 when ingester's lifecycler is set to read-only mode. #9095\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add a new field, `encode_time_seconds` to query stats log messages, to record the amount of time it takes the query-frontend to encode a response.

The default behaviour is to send all requests to all backends. This can be configured with `-proxy.secondary-backends-request-proportion`. #8532\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Check annotations emitted by both backends are the same when comparing responses from two backends. #8660\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compare native histograms in query results when comparing results between two backends. #8724\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Don't consider responses to be different during response comparison if both backends' responses contain different series, but all samples are within the recent sample window. #8749 #8894\n* [ENHANCEMENT] When the expected and actual response for a matrix series is different, the full set of samples for that series from both backends will now be logged. #8947\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Wait up to `-server.graceful-shutdown-timeout` for inflight requests to finish when shutting down, rather than immediately terminating inflight requests on shutdown. #8985\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Optionally consider equivalent error messages the same when comparing responses. Enabled by default, disable with `-proxy.require-exact-error-match=true`. #9143 #9350 #9366\n* [BUGFIX] Ensure any errors encountered while forwarding a request to a backend (eg. DNS resolution failures) are logged. #8419\n* [BUGFIX] The comparison of the results should not fail when either side contains extra samples from within SkipRecentSamples duration. #8920\n* [BUGFIX] When `-proxy.compare-skip-recent-samples` is enabled, compare sample timestamps with the time the query requests were made, rather than the time at which the comparison is occurring. #9416\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Specify in which component the configuration flags `-compactor.blocks-retention-period`, `-querier.max-query-lookback`, `-query-frontend.max-total-query-length`, `-query-frontend.max-query-expression-size-bytes` are applied and that they are applied to remote read as well. #8433\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Provide more detailed recommendations on how to migrate from classic to native histograms. #8864\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Clarify that `{namespace}` and `{groupName}` path segments in the ruler config API should be URL-escaped. #8969\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Include stalled compactor network drive information in runbooks. #9297\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Document `/ingester/prepare-partition-downscale` and `/ingester/prepare-instance-ring-downscale` endpoints. #9132\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Describe read-only mode of ingesters in component documentation. #9132\n\n### Tools\n\n* [CHANGE] `wal-reader`: Renamed `-series-entries` to `-print-series`.

The 503 status code is returned if the endpoint is called while the ingester is not in `Running` state. #7486\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: Include label name in `err-mimir-label-value-too-long` error message: #7740\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: enabled 1 out 10 errors log sampling by default. All the discarded samples will still be tracked by the `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metric. The feature can be configured via `-ingester.error-sample-rate` (0 to log all errors). #7807\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: Query results caching and experimental query blocking now utilize the PromQL string-formatted query format rather than the unvalidated query as submitted to the frontend. #7742\n  * Query results caching should be more stable as all equivalent queries receive the same cache key, but there may be cache churn on first deploy with the updated format\n  * Query blocking can no longer be circumvented with an equivalent query in a different format; see [Configure queries to block](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/configure/configure-blocked-queries/)\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: stop using `-validation.create-grace-period` to clamp how far into the future a query can span. #8075\n* [CHANGE] Clamp [`GOMAXPROCS`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#GOMAXPROCS) to [`runtime.NumCPU`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#NumCPU). #8201\n* [CHANGE] Anonymous usage statistics tracking: add CPU usage percentage tracking. #8282\n* [CHANGE] Added new metric `cortex_compactor_disk_out_of_space_errors_total` which counts how many times a compaction failed due to the compactor being out of disk. #8237\n* [CHANGE] Anonymous usage statistics tracking: report active series in addition to in-memory series. #8279\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: `evaluation_delay` field in the rule group configuration has been deprecated. Please use `query_offset` instead (it has the same exact meaning and behaviour). #8295\n* [CHANGE] General: remove `-log.buffered`.

When set, queries at the store-gateway's query gate will not wait longer than that to execute. If a query reaches the wait timeout, then the querier will retry the blocks on a different store-gateway. If all store-gateways are unavailable, then the query will fail with `err-mimir-store-consistency-check-failed`. #7777 #8149\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.lazy-loading-concurrency-queue-timeout`. When set, loads of index-headers at the store-gateway's index-header lazy load gate will not wait longer than that to execute. If a load reaches the wait timeout, then the querier will retry the blocks on a different store-gateway. If all store-gateways are unavailable, then the query will fail with `err-mimir-store-consistency-check-failed`. #8138\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Optimize querying with regexp matchers. #8106\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Introduce `-distributor.max-request-pool-buffer-size` to allow configuring the maximum size of the request pool buffers. #8082\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: improve performance when streaming chunks to queriers is enabled (`-querier.prefer-streaming-chunks-from-store-gateways=true`) and the query selects fewer than `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.batch-series-size` series (defaults to 5000 series). #8039\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: active series are now updated along with owned series. They decrease when series change ownership between ingesters. This helps provide a more accurate total of active series when ingesters are added. This is only enabled when `-ingester.track-ingester-owned-series` or `-ingester.use-ingester-owned-series-for-limits` are enabled. #8084\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: include route name in query stats log lines. #8191\n* [ENHANCEMENT] OTLP: Speed up conversion from OTel to Mimir format by about 8% and reduce memory consumption by about 30%. Can be disabled via `-distributor.direct-otlp-translation-enabled=false` #7957\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester/Querier: Optimise regexps with long lists of alternates. #8221, #8234\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Include more detail in tracing of queries. #8242\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: add `insight=true` to remote-write and OTLP write handlers when the HTTP response status code is 4xx. #8294\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce locked time while matching postings for a label, improving the write latency and compaction speed. #8327\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce the amount of locks taken during the Head compaction's garbage-collection process, improving the write latency and compaction speed. #8327\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: log the start, end time and matchers for remote read requests to the query stats logs. #8326 #8370 #8373\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: prometheus retry on 5xx and 429 errors, while otlp collector only retry on 429, 502, 503 and 504, mapping other 5xx errors to the retryable ones in otlp endpoint. #8324 #8339\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: make OTLP endpoint return marshalled proto bytes as response body for 4xx/5xx errors. #8227\n* [BUGFIX] Rules: improve error handling when querier is local to the ruler. #7567\n* [BUGFIX] Querier, store-gateway: Protect against panics raised during snappy encoding. #7520\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Prevent timely compaction of empty blocks. #7624\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: Don't cache context.Canceled errors for bucket index. #7620\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: account for `\"other\"` time in LabelValues and LabelNames requests. #7622\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: Don't panic when using the `-query-frontend.downstream-url` flag. #7651\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: when receiving multiple exemplars for a native histogram via remote write, sort them and only report an error if all are older than the latest exemplar as this could be a partial update. #7640 #7948 #8014\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: don't retain blocks if they finish exactly on the boundary of the retention window. #7656\n* [BUGFIX] Bug-fixes and improvements to experimental native histograms. #7744 #7813\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: return an error when a query uses `label_join` with an invalid destination label name. #7744\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: correct outstanding job estimation in metrics and `compaction-planner` tool when block labels differ. #7745\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: turn native histogram validation errors in TSDB into soft ingester errors that result in returning 4xx to the end-user instead of 5xx. In the case of TSDB validation errors, the counter `cortex_discarded_samples_total` will be increased with the `reason` label set to `\"invalid-native-histogram\"`. #7736 #7773\n* [BUGFIX] Do not wrap error message with `sampled 1/<frequency>` if it's not actually sampled. #7784\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: do not track cortex_querier_blocks_consistency_checks_failed_total metric if query has been canceled or interrued due to any error not related to blocks consistency check failed. #7752\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: ignore instances with no tokens when calculating local limits to prevent discards during ingester scale-up #7881\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: do not reuse exemplars slice in the write request if there are more than 10 exemplars per series. This should help to reduce the in-use memory in case of few requests with a very large number of exemplars. #7936\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: fix down scaling of native histograms in the distributor when timeseries unmarshal cache is in use. #7947\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: fix cardinality API to return more accurate number of in-memory series when number of zones is larger than replication factor. #7984\n* [BUGFIX] All: fix config validation for non-ingester modules, when ingester's ring is configured with spread-minimizing token generation strategy. #7990\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: copy LabelValues strings out of mapped memory to avoid a segmentation fault if the region becomes unmapped before the result is marshaled. #8003\n* [BUGFIX] OTLP: Don't generate target_info unless at least one identifying label is defined. #8012\n* [BUGFIX] OTLP: Don't generate target_info unless there are metrics. #8012\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: Experimental query queue splitting: fix issue where offset and range selector duration were not considered when predicting query component. #7742\n* [BUGFIX] Querying: Empty matrix results were incorrectly returning `null` instead of `[]`. #8029\n* [BUGFIX] All: don't increment `thanos_objstore_bucket_operation_failures_total` metric for cancelled requests. #8072\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix empty metric name matcher not being applied under certain conditions. #8076\n* [BUGFIX] Querying: Fix regex matching of multibyte runes with dot operator. #8089\n* [BUGFIX] Querying: matrix results returned from instant queries were not sorted by series. #8113\n* [BUGFIX] Query scheduler: Fix a crash in result marshaling. #8140\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: Allow long-running index scans to be interrupted. #8154\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix splitting of queries using `@ start()` and `@end()` modifiers on a subquery. Previously the `start()` and `end()` would be evaluated using the start end end of the split query instead of the original query. #8162\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: Don't discard time series with invalid exemplars, just drop affected exemplars. #8224\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed in-memory series count when replaying a corrupted WAL. #8295\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fix context cancellation handling when a query is busy looking up series in the TSDB index and `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache*` or `-blocks-storage.tsdb.block-postings-for-matchers-cache*` are in use. #8337\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fix edge case where bucket indexes are sometimes cached forever instead of with the expected TTL. #8343\n* [BUGFIX] OTLP handler: fix errors returned by OTLP handler when used via httpgrpc tunneling. #8363\n* [BUGFIX] Update `github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp` to address [CVE-2024-6104](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v6v8-xj6m-xwqh). #8539\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Fixes a number of bugs in silences which could cause an existing silence to be deleted/expired when updating the silence failed. This could happen when the replacing silence was invalid or exceeded limits. #8525\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Fix per-tenant silence limits not reloaded during runtime. #8456\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Fix help message for utf-8-strict-mode. #8572\n* [BUGFIX] Upgrade golang to 1.22.5 to address [CVE-2024-24791](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24791). #8600\n\n### Mixin\n\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: Removed obsolete `MimirQueriesIncorrect` alert that used test-exporter metrics.

To ensure backwards compatibility, during a migration from a version prior to 2.11.0 to 2.12 or later, `-ingester.return-only-grpc-errors` should be set to `false`. Once all the components are migrated, the flag can be removed.   #7151\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: the following CLI flags have been moved from \"experimental\" to \"advanced\": #7169\n  * `-ingester.ring.token-generation-strategy`\n  * `-ingester.ring.spread-minimizing-zones`\n  * `-ingester.ring.spread-minimizing-join-ring-in-order`\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: the default value of the CLI flag `-query-frontend.max-cache-freshness` (and its respective YAML configuration parameter) has been changed from `1m` to `10m`. #7161\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: default the optimization `-distributor.write-requests-buffer-pooling-enabled` to `true`. #7165\n* [CHANGE] Tracing: Move query information to span attributes instead of span logs. #7046\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: the default value of circuit breaker's CLI flag `-ingester.client.circuit-breaker.cooldown-period` has been changed from `1m` to `10s`. #7310\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: remove `cortex_bucket_store_blocks_loaded_by_duration`. `cortex_bucket_store_series_blocks_queried` is better suited for detecting when compactors are not able to keep up with the number of blocks to compact. #7309\n* [CHANGE] Ingester, Distributor: the support for rejecting push requests received via gRPC before reading them into memory, enabled via `-ingester.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter` and `-distributor.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter`, is now stable and enabled by default. The configuration options have been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.14. #7360\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: Change`-distributor.enable-otlp-metadata-storage` flag's default to true, and deprecate it. The flag will be removed in Mimir 2.14. #7366\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Use a shorter TTL for cached items related to temporary blocks. #7407 #7534\n* [CHANGE] Standardise exemplar label as \"trace_id\". #7475\n* [CHANGE] The configuration option `-querier.max-query-into-future` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.14. #7496\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: the metric `cortex_distributor_sample_delay_seconds` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.14. #7516\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: The deprecated YAML setting `frontend.cache_unaligned_requests` has been moved to `limits.cache_unaligned_requests`. #7519\n* [CHANGE] Querier: the CLI flag `-querier.minimize-ingester-requests` has been moved from \"experimental\" to \"advanced\". #7638\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: allow only POST method on `/ingester/shutdown`, as previously it was too easy to accidentally trigger through GET requests. At the same time, add an option to keep the existing behavior by introducing an `-api.get-request-for-ingester-shutdown-enabled` flag. This flag will be removed in Mimir 2.15. #7707\n* [FEATURE] Introduce `-server.log-source-ips-full` option to log all IPs from `Forwarded`, `X-Real-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For` headers. #7250\n* [FEATURE] Introduce `-tenant-federation.max-tenants` option to limit the max number of tenants allowed for requests when federation is enabled. #6959\n* [FEATURE] Cardinality API: added a new `count_method` parameter which enables counting active label names. #7085\n* [FEATURE] Querier / query-frontend: added `-querier.promql-experimental-functions-enabled` CLI flag (and respective YAML config option) to enable experimental PromQL functions.

Supports ABS, GCS, and S3-compatible object storage. #6607\n\n## 2.11.0\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] The following deprecated configurations have been removed: #6673 #6779 #6808 #6814\n  * `-querier.iterators`\n  * `-querier.batch-iterators`\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-chunk-pool-bytes`\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunk-pool-min-bucket-size-bytes`\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunk-pool-max-bucket-size-bytes`\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.bucket-index.enabled`\n* [CHANGE] Querier: Split worker GRPC config into separate client configs for the frontend and scheduler to allow TLS to be configured correctly when specifying the `tls_server_name`. The GRPC config specified under `-querier.frontend-client.*` will no longer apply to the scheduler client, and will need to be set explicitly under `-querier.scheduler-client.*`. #6445 #6573\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: enable sparse index headers by default. Sparse index headers reduce the time to load an index header up to 90%. #6005\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: lazy-loading concurrency limit default value is now 4. #6004\n* [CHANGE] General: enabled `-log.buffered` by default. The `-log.buffered` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.13. #6131\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: changed default `-blocks-storage.tsdb.series-hash-cache-max-size-bytes` setting from `1GB` to `350MB`. The new default cache size is enough to store the hashes for all series in a ingester, assuming up to 2M in-memory series per ingester and using the default 13h retention period for local TSDB blocks in the ingesters. #6130\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: removed `cortex_query_frontend_workers_enqueued_requests_total`. Use `cortex_query_frontend_enqueue_duration_seconds_count` instead. #6121\n* [CHANGE] Ingester / querier: enable ingester to querier chunks streaming by default and mark it as stable. #6174\n* [CHANGE] Ingester / querier: enable ingester query request minimisation by default and mark it as stable. #6174\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: changed the default value for the experimental configuration parameter `-blocks-storage.tsdb.early-head-compaction-min-estimated-series-reduction-percentage` from 10 to 15. #6186\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: `/ingester/push` HTTP endpoint has been removed. This endpoint was added for testing and troubleshooting, but was never documented or used for anything. #6299\n* [CHANGE] Experimental setting `-log.rate-limit-logs-per-second-burst` renamed to `-log.rate-limit-logs-burst-size`. #6230\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: by setting the newly introduced experimental CLI flag `-ingester.return-only-grpc-errors` to true, ingester will return only gRPC errors. #6443 #6680 #6723\n* [CHANGE] Upgrade Node.js to v20. #6540\n* [CHANGE] Querier: `cortex_querier_blocks_consistency_checks_failed_total` is now incremented when a block couldn't be queried from any attempted store-gateway as opposed to incremented after each attempt. Also `cortex_querier_blocks_consistency_checks_total` is incremented once per query as opposed to once per attempt (with 3 attempts). #6590\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Modify utilization based read path limiter to base memory usage on Go heap size. #6584\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: added option `-distributor.retry-after-header.enabled` to include the `Retry-After` header in recoverable error responses. #6608\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: add experimental support for query blocking. Queries are blocked on a per-tenant basis and is configured via the limit `blocked_queries`. #5609\n* [FEATURE] Vault: Added support for new Vault authentication methods: `AppRole`, `Kubernetes`, `UserPass` and `Token`. #6143\n* [FEATURE] Add experimental endpoint `/api/v1/cardinality/active_series` to return the set of active series for a given selector. #6536 #6619 #6651 #6667 #6717\n* [FEATURE] Added `-<prefix>.s3.part-size` flag to configure the S3 minimum file size in bytes used for multipart uploads. #6592\n* [FEATURE] Add the experimental `-<prefix>.s3.send-content-md5` flag (defaults to `false`) to configure S3 Put Object requests to send a `Content-MD5` header. Setting this flag is not recommended unless your object storage does not support checksums. #6622\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: add an experimental flag `-distributor.reusable-ingester-push-worker` that can be used to pre-allocate a pool of workers to be used to send push requests to the ingesters. #6660\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Support enabling of automatically generated name suffixes for metrics ingested via OTLP, through the flag `-distributor.otel-metric-suffixes-enabled`. #6542\n* [FEATURE] Ingester: ingester can now track which of the user's series the ingester actually owns according to the ring, and only consider owned series when checking for user series limit. This helps to avoid hitting the user's series limit when scaling up ingesters or changing user's ingester shard size. Feature is currently experimental, and disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting `-ingester.use-ingester-owned-series-for-limits` (to use owned series for limiting). This is currently limited to multi-zone ingester setup, with replication factor being equal to number of zones. #6718 #7087\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: don't treat cancel as an error. #4648\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: exported summary `cortex_ingester_inflight_push_requests_summary` tracking total number of inflight requests in percentile buckets. #5845\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: add `cortex_query_scheduler_enqueue_duration_seconds` metric that records the time taken to enqueue or reject a query request. #5879\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: add `cortex_query_frontend_enqueue_duration_seconds` metric that records the time taken to enqueue or reject a query request. When query-scheduler is in use, the metric has the `scheduler_address` label to differentiate the enqueue duration by query-scheduler backend. #5879 #6087 #6120\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add metric `cortex_bucket_store_blocks_loaded_by_duration` for counting the loaded number of blocks based on their duration. #6074  #6129\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Expose `/sync/mutex/wait/total:seconds` Go runtime metric as `go_sync_mutex_wait_total_seconds_total` from all components. #5879\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: improve latency with many concurrent queriers. #5880\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: add new per-tenant `cortex_ruler_queries_zero_fetched_series_total` metric to track rules that fetched no series. #5925\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Implement support for `limit`, `limit_per_metric` and `metric` parameters for `<Prometheus HTTP prefix>/api/v1/metadata` endpoint. #5890\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: add experimental support for storing metadata when ingesting metrics via OTLP. This makes metrics description and type available when ingesting metrics via OTLP. Enable with `-distributor.enable-otlp-metadata-storage=true`. #5693 #6035 #6254\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added support for sampling errors, which can be enabled by setting `-ingester.error-sample-rate`. This way each error will be logged once in the configured number of times. All the discarded samples will still be tracked by the `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metric. #5584 #6014\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Fetch secrets used to configure TLS on the Alertmanager client from Vault when `-vault.enabled` is true. #5239\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: added query-sharding support for `group by` aggregation queries. #6024\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Fetch secrets used to configure server-side TLS from Vault when `-vault.enabled` is true. #6052.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Packaging: add logrotate config file. #6142\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: add the experimental configuration options `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-max-bytes` and `-blocks-storage.tsdb.block-postings-for-matchers-cache-max-bytes` to enforce a limit in bytes on the `PostingsForMatchers()` cache used by ingesters (the cache limit is per TSDB head and block basis, not a global one). The experimental configuration options `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-size` and `-blocks-storage.tsdb.block-postings-for-matchers-cache-size` have been deprecated. #6151\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: use the `PostingsForMatchers()` in-memory cache for label values queries with matchers too. #6151\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester / store-gateway: optimized regex matchers. #6168 #6250\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Include ingester IDs in circuit breaker related metrics and logs. #6206\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: improve errors and logging when streaming chunks from ingesters and store-gateways. #6194 #6309\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: Add `cortex_querier_federation_exemplar_tenants_queried` and `cortex_querier_federation_tenants_queried` metrics to track the number of tenants queried by multi-tenant queries. #6374 #6409\n* [ENHANCEMENT] All: added an experimental `-server.grpc.num-workers` flag that configures the number of long-living workers used to process gRPC requests. This could decrease the CPU usage by reducing the number of stack allocations. #6311\n* [ENHANCEMENT] All: improved IPv6 support by using the proper host:port formatting. #6311\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: always return error encountered during chunks streaming, rather than `the stream has already been exhausted`. #6345 #6433\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: add `instance_enable_ipv6` to support IPv6. #6111\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: return same detailed error messages as queriers when chunks or series limits are reached. #6347\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: reduce memory consumed for queries that hit store-gateways. #6348\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: include corresponding trace ID with log messages associated with rule evaluation. #6379 #6520\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: clarify log messages and span events emitted while querying ingesters, and include both ingester name and address when relevant. #6381\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: introduce new experimental configuration parameters `-<prefix>.memcached.write-buffer-size-bytes` `-<prefix>.memcached.read-buffer-size-bytes` to customise the memcached client write and read buffer size (the buffer is allocated for each memcached connection). #6468\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester, Distributor: added experimental support for rejecting push requests received via gRPC before reading them into memory, if ingester or distributor is unable to accept the request. This is activated by using `-ingester.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter` for ingester, and `-distributor.limit-inflight-requests-using-grpc-method-limiter` for distributor. #5976 #6300\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add capability in store-gateways to accept number of tokens through config. `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.num-tokens`, `default-value=512` #4863\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: return warnings generated during query evaluation. #6391\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add the option `-server.http-read-header-timeout` to enable specifying a timeout for reading HTTP request headers. It defaults to 0, in which case reading of headers can take up to `-server.http-read-timeout`, leaving no time for reading body, if there's any. #6517\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add connection-string option, `-<prefix>.azure.connection-string`, for Azure Blob Storage. #6487\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Add `-ingester.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests-bytes`. This limit protects the ingester against requests that together may cause an OOM. #6492\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: add new per-tenant `cortex_ingester_local_limits` metric to expose the calculated local per-tenant limits seen at each ingester. Exports the local per-tenant series limit with label `{limit=\"max_global_series_per_user\"}` #6403\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: added \"queue_time_seconds\" field to \"query stats\" log. This is total time that query and subqueries spent in the queue, before queriers picked it up. #6537\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add `-server.report-grpc-codes-in-instrumentation-label-enabled` CLI flag to specify whether gRPC status codes should be used in `status_code` label of `cortex_request_duration_seconds` metric. It defaults to false, meaning that successful and erroneous gRPC status codes are represented with `success` and `error` respectively. #6562\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add `-ingester.client.report-grpc-codes-in-instrumentation-label-enabled` CLI flag to specify whether gRPC status codes should be used in `status_code` label of `cortex_ingester_client_request_duration_seconds` metric. It defaults to false, meaning that successful and erroneous gRPC status codes are represented with `2xx` and `error` respectively. #6562\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Server: Add `-server.http-log-closed-connections-without-response-enabled` option to log details about connections to HTTP server that were closed before any data was sent back.

The `distributor.ingestion-burst-factor` is used to set the underlying ingestion rate limiter token bucket's burst size to a multiple of the per distributor `distributor.ingestion-rate-limit` and the `distributor.ingestion-burst-factor`. This is disabled by default. #6662\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add debug message to track tenants sending queries that are not able to benefit from caches. #6732\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: return server overload error in the event of exceeding the ingestion rate limit. #6549\n* [BUGFIX] Ring: Ensure network addresses used for component hash rings are formatted correctly when using IPv6. #6068\n* [BUGFIX] Query-scheduler: don't retain connections from queriers that have shut down, leading to gradually increasing enqueue latency over time. #6100 #6145\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: prevent query logic from continuing to execute after queries are canceled. #6085\n* [BUGFIX] Ensure correct nesting of children of the `querier.Select` tracing span. #6085\n* [BUGFIX] Packaging: fix preremove script preventing upgrades on RHEL based OS. #6067\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: return actual error rather than `attempted to read series at index XXX from stream, but the stream has already been exhausted` (or even no error at all) when streaming chunks from ingesters or store-gateways is enabled and an error occurs while streaming chunks. #6346\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: reduce log volume when querying ingesters with zone-awareness enabled and one or more instances in a single zone unavailable. #6381\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: don't try to query further ingesters if ingester query request minimization is enabled and a query limit is reached as a result of the responses from the initial set of ingesters. #6402\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Don't cache context cancellation error when querying. #6446\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: don't ignore errors encountered while iterating through chunks or samples in response to a query request. #6469\n* [BUGFIX] All: fix issue where traces for some inter-component gRPC calls would incorrectly show the call as failing due to cancellation. #6470\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: correctly mark streaming requests to ingesters or store-gateways as successful, not cancelled, in metrics and traces. #6471 #6505\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fix issue where queries fail with \"context canceled\" error when an ingester or store-gateway fails healthcheck while the query is in progress. #6550\n* [BUGFIX] Tracing: When creating an OpenTelemetry tracing span, add it to the context for later retrieval. #6614\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: always report query results to query-frontends, even when cancelled, to ensure query-frontends don't wait for results that will otherwise never arrive. #6703\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: attempt to query ingesters in PENDING state, to reduce the likelihood that scaling up the number of ingesters in multiple zones simultaneously causes a read outage. #6726 #6727\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: don't cancel inflight queries from a query-scheduler if the stream between the querier and query-scheduler is broken. #6728\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: Fix double-counting of some duration metrics. #6616\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed possible series matcher corruption leading to wrong series being included in query results. #6884\n\n### Mixin\n\n* [CHANGE] Dashboards: enabled reporting gRPC codes as `status_code` label in Mimir dashboards. In case of gRPC calls, the successful `status_code` label on `cortex_request_duration_seconds` and gRPC client request duration metrics has changed from 'success' and '2xx' to 'OK'. #6561\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: remove `MimirGossipMembersMismatch` alert and replace it with `MimirGossipMembersTooHigh` and `MimirGossipMembersTooLow` alerts that should have a higher signal-to-noise ratio. #6508\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Optionally show rejected requests on Mimir Writes dashboard. Useful when used together with \"early request rejection\" in ingester and distributor. #6132 #6556\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: added a critical alert for `CompactorSkippedBlocksWithOutOfOrderChunks` when multiple blocks are affected. #6410\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Added the min-replicas for autoscaling dashboards. #6528\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Show queries per second for the `/api/v1/cardinality/` endpoints on the \"Overview\" dashboard. #6720\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: fixed issue where `GossipMembersMismatch` warning message referred to per-instance labels that were not produced by the alert query. #6146\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Fix autoscaling dashboard panels for KEDA > 2.9. [Requires scraping the KEDA operator for metrics since they moved](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/3972). #6528\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fix autoscaling alerts for KEDA > 2.9. [Requires scraping the KEDA operator for metrics since they moved](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/3972). #6528\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: reduce `-server.grpc-max-concurrent-streams` to 500. #5666\n* [CHANGE] Changed default `_config.cluster_domain` from `cluster.local` to `cluster.local.` to reduce the number of DNS lookups made by Mimir. #6389\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: changed default `_config.autoscaling_query_frontend_cpu_target_utilization` from `1` to `0.75`. #6395\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: Increase HPA scale down period such that distributors are slower to scale down after autoscaling up. #6589\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Change the default timeout used for index-queries caches from `200ms` to `450ms`. #6786\n* [FEATURE] Store-gateway: Allow automated zone-by-zone downscaling, that can be enabled via the `store_gateway_automated_downscale_enabled` flag.

You should configure `-ingester.instance-limits.max-series` and rely on `MimirIngesterReachingSeriesLimit` alert instead. #5593\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: removed `MimirProvisioningTooManyWrites` alert. The alerting threshold used in this alert was chosen arbitrarily and ingesters receiving an higher number of samples / sec don't necessarily have any issue. You should rely on SLOs metrics and alerts instead. #5706\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: don't raise `MimirRequestErrors` or `MimirRequestLatency` alert for the `/debug/pprof` endpoint. #5826\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: adjust layout of \"rollout progress\" dashboard panels so that the \"rollout progress\" panel doesn't require scrolling. #5113\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: show container name first in \"pods count per version\" panel on \"rollout progress\" dashboard. #5113\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: show time spend waiting for turn when lazy loading index headers in the \"index-header lazy load gate latency\" panel on the \"queries\" dashboard. #5313\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: split query results cache hit ratio by request type in \"Query results cache hit ratio\" panel on the \"Mimir / Queries\" dashboard. #5423\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: add \"rejected queries\" panel to \"queries\" dashboard. #5429\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: add native histogram active series and active buckets to \"tenants\" dashboard. #5543\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: add panels to \"Mimir / Writes\" for requests rejected for per-instance limits. #5638\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: rename \"Blocks currently loaded\" to \"Blocks currently owned\" in the \"Mimir / Queries\" dashboard. #5705\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Add `MimirIngestedDataTooFarInTheFuture` warning alert that triggers when Mimir ingests sample with timestamp more than 1h in the future. #5822\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: fix `MimirIngesterRestarts` to fire only when the ingester container is restarted, excluding the cases the pod is rescheduled. #5397\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: fix \"unhealthy pods\" panel on \"rollout progress\" dashboard showing only a number rather than the name of the workload and the number of unhealthy pods if only one workload has unhealthy pods. #5113 #5200\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: fixed `MimirIngesterHasNotShippedBlocks` and `MimirIngesterHasNotShippedBlocksSinceStart` alerts. #5396\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fix `MimirGossipMembersMismatch` to include `admin-api` and custom compactor pods. `admin-api` is a GEM component. #5641 #5797\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: fix autoscaling dashboard panels that could show multiple series for a single component. #5810\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: fix ruler-querier scaling metric panel query and split into CPU and memory scaling metric panels. #5739\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] Removed `_config.querier.concurrency` configuration option and replaced it with `_config.querier_max_concurrency` and `_config.ruler_querier_max_concurrency` to allow to easily fine tune it for different querier deployments. #5322\n* [CHANGE] Change `_config.multi_zone_ingester_max_unavailable` to 50. #5327\n* [CHANGE] Change distributors rolling update strategy configuration: `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` are set to `15%` and `0`. #5714\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Add horizontal pod autoscaler config, that can be enabled using `autoscaling_alertmanager_enabled: true`. #5194 #5249\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Enable the `track_sizes` feature for Memcached pods to help determine cache efficiency. #5209\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add per-container map for environment variables. #5181\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `PodDisruptionBudget`s for compactor, continuous-test, distributor, overrides-exporter, querier, query-frontend, query-scheduler, rollout-operator, ruler, ruler-querier, ruler-query-frontend, ruler-query-scheduler, and all memcached workloads. #5098\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: configure the ruler storage cache when the metadata cache is enabled. #5326 #5334\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Shuffle-sharding: ingester shards in user-classes can now be configured to target different series and limit percentage utilization through `_config.shuffle_sharding.target_series_per_ingester` and `_config.shuffle_sharding.target_utilization_percentage` values. #5470\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: allow adjustment of the targeted CPU usage as a percentage of requested CPU. This can be adjusted with `_config.autoscaling_distributor_cpu_target_utilization`. #5525\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: add configuration option `_config.ruler_remote_evaluation_max_query_response_size_bytes` to easily set the maximum query response size allowed (in bytes). #5592\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: dynamically set `GOMAXPROCS` based on the CPU request. This should reduce distributor CPU utilization, assuming the CPU request is set to a value close to the actual utilization. #5588\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: dynamically set `GOMAXPROCS` based on the CPU request. This should reduce noisy neighbour issues created by the querier, whose CPU utilization could eventually saturate the Kubernetes node if unbounded. #5646 #5658\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow to remove an entry from the configured environment variable for a given component, setting the environment value to `null` in the `*_env_map` objects (e.g. `store_gateway_env_map+:: { 'field': null}`). #5599\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow overriding the default number of replicas for `etcd`. #5589\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: reduce memory request for results, chunks and metadata caches. The requested memory is 5% greater than the configured memcached max cache size. #5661\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Autoscaling: Add the following configuration options to fine tune autoscaler target utilization: #5679 #5682 #5689\n  * `autoscaling_querier_target_utilization` (defaults to `0.75`)\n  * `autoscaling_mimir_read_target_utilization` (defaults to `0.75`)\n  * `autoscaling_ruler_querier_cpu_target_utilization` (defaults to `1`)\n  * `autoscaling_distributor_memory_target_utilization` (defaults to `1`)\n  * `autoscaling_ruler_cpu_target_utilization` (defaults to `1`)\n  * `autoscaling_query_frontend_cpu_target_utilization` (defaults to `1`)\n  * `autoscaling_ruler_query_frontend_cpu_target_utilization` (defaults to `1`)\n  * `autoscaling_alertmanager_cpu_target_utilization` (defaults to `1`)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Gossip-ring: add appProtocol for istio compatibility. #5680\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add _config.commonConfig to allow adding common configuration parameters for all Mimir components. #5703\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update rollout-operator to `v0.7.0`. #5718\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Increase the default rollout speed for store-gateway when lazy loading is disabled. #5823\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add autoscaling on memory for ruler-queriers. #5739\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Deduplicate scaled object creation for most objects that scale on CPU and memory. #6411\n* [BUGFIX] Fix compilation when index, chunks or metadata caches are disabled. #5710\n* [BUGFIX] Autoscaling: treat OOMing containers as though they are using their full memory request. #5739\n* [BUGFIX] Autoscaling: if no containers are up, report 0 memory usage instead of no data. #6411\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Mimirtool uses paging to fetch all dashboards from Grafana when running `mimirtool analyse grafana`. This allows the tool to work correctly when running against Grafana instances with more than a 1000 dashboards. #5825\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Extract metric name from queries that have a `__name__` matcher. #5911\n* [BUGFIX] Mimirtool no longer parses label names as metric names when handling templating variables that are populated using `label_values(<label_name>)` when running `mimirtool analyse grafana`. #5832\n* [BUGFIX] Fix panic when analyzing a grafana dashboard with multiline queries in templating variables. #5911\n\n### Query-tee\n\n* [CHANGE] Proxy `Content-Type` response header from backend. Previously `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8` was returned on all requests. #5183\n* [CHANGE] Increase default value of `-proxy.compare-skip-recent-samples` to avoid racing with recording rule evaluation. #5561\n* [CHANGE] Add `-backend.skip-tls-verify` to optionally skip TLS verification on backends. #5656\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [CHANGE] Fix reference to `get-started` documentation directory. #5476\n* [CHANGE] Fix link to external OTLP/HTTP documentation.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved `MimirRulerTooManyFailedQueries` runbook. #5586\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved \"Recover accidentally deleted blocks\" runbook. #5620\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Documented options and trade-offs to query label names and values. #5582\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved `MimirRequestErrors` runbook for alertmanager. #5694\n\n### Tools\n\n* [CHANGE] copyblocks: add support for S3 and the ability to copy between different object storage services. Due to this, the `-source-service` and `-destination-service` flags are now required and the `-service` flag has been removed. #5486\n* [FEATURE] undelete-block-gcs: Added new tool for undeleting blocks on GCS storage. #5610 #5855\n* [FEATURE] wal-reader: Added new tool for printing entries in TSDB WAL. #5780\n* [ENHANCEMENT] ulidtime: add -seconds flag to print timestamps as Unix timestamps. #5621\n* [ENHANCEMENT] ulidtime: exit with status code 1 if some ULIDs can't be parsed. #5621\n* [ENHANCEMENT] tsdb-index-toc: added index-header size estimates. #5652\n* [BUGFIX] Stop tools from panicking when `-help` flag is passed. #5412\n* [BUGFIX] Remove github.com/golang/glog command line flags from tools. #5413\n\n## 2.9.4\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Docker base images from `alpine:3.18.3` to `alpine:3.18.5`. #6895\n\n## 2.9.3\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [BUGFIX] Update `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` to `0.44` which includes a fix for CVE-2023-45142. #6637\n\n## 2.9.2\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [BUGFIX] Update grpc-go library to 1.56.3 and `golang.org/x/net` to `0.17`, which include fix for CVE-2023-44487. #6353 #6364\n\n## 2.9.1\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update alpine base image to 3.18.3. #6021\n\n## 2.9.0\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: change expanded postings, postings, and label values index cache key format. These caches will be invalidated when rolling out the new Mimir version. #4770 #4978 #5037\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: remove the \"forwarding\" feature as it isn't necessary anymore. #4876\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: Change the default value of `-query-frontend.query-sharding-max-regexp-size-bytes` from `0` to `4096`. #4932\n* [CHANGE] Querier: `-querier.query-ingesters-within` has been moved from a global flag to a per-tenant override. #4287\n* [CHANGE] Querier: Use `-blocks-storage.tsdb.retention-period` instead of `-querier.query-ingesters-within` for calculating the lookback period for shuffle sharded ingesters. Setting `-querier.query-ingesters-within=0` no longer disables shuffle sharding on the read path. #4287\n* [CHANGE] Block upload: `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/files` endpoint now allows file uploads with no `Content-Length`. #4956\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: deprecate configuration parameters for chunk pooling, they will be removed in Mimir 2.11. The following options are now also ignored: #4996\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-chunk-pool-bytes`\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunk-pool-min-bucket-size-bytes`\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunk-pool-max-bucket-size-bytes`\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: remove metrics `cortex_bucket_store_chunk_pool_requested_bytes_total` and `cortex_bucket_store_chunk_pool_returned_bytes_total`. #4996\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: change default of `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay` to `1d`. This will automatically clean up partial blocks that were a result of failed block upload or deletion. #5026\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: the deprecated configuration parameter `-compactor.consistency-delay` has been removed. #5050\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: the deprecated configuration parameter `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.consistency-delay` has been removed. #5050\n* [CHANGE] The configuration parameter `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.bucket-index.enabled` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.11. Mimir is running by default with the bucket index enabled since version 2.0, and starting from the version 2.11 it will not be possible to disable it. #5051\n* [CHANGE] The configuration parameters `-querier.iterators` and `-query.batch-iterators` have been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.11. Mimir runs by default with `-querier.batch-iterators=true`, and starting from version 2.11 it will not be possible to change this. #5114\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: change default of `-compactor.first-level-compaction-wait-period` to 25m. #5128\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: changed default of `-ruler.poll-interval` from `1m` to `10m`. Starting from this release, the configured rule groups will also be re-synced each time they're modified calling the ruler configuration API. #5170\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: add `-query-frontend.log-query-request-headers` to enable logging of request headers in query logs. #5030\n* [FEATURE] Store-gateway: add experimental feature to retain lazy-loaded index headers between restarts by eagerly loading them during startup. This is disabled by default and can only be enabled if lazy loading is enabled. To enable this set the following: #5606\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header-lazy-loading-enabled` must be set to true\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.eager-loading-startup-enabled` must be set to true\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add per-tenant limit `-validation.max-native-histogram-buckets` to be able to ignore native histogram samples that have too many buckets. #4765\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: reduce memory usage in some LabelValues calls. #4789\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add a `stage` label to the metric `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_touched`. This label now applies to `data_type=\"chunks\"` and `data_type=\"series\"`. The `stage` label has 2 values: `processed` - the number of series that parsed - and `returned` - the number of series selected from the processed bytes to satisfy the query. #4797 #4830\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: make `__meta_tenant_id` label available in relabeling rules configured via `metric_relabel_configs`. #4725\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: added the configurable limit `compactor.block-upload-max-block-size-bytes` or `compactor_block_upload_max_block_size_bytes` to limit the byte size of uploaded or validated blocks. #4680\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: reduce CPU utilisation when shuffle sharding is enabled with large shard sizes. #4851\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Packaging: facilitate configuration management by instructing systemd to start mimir with a configuration file. #4810\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: reduce memory allocations when looking up postings from cache. #4861 #4869 #4962 #5047\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: retain only necessary bytes when reading series from the bucket. #4926\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester, store-gateway: clear the shutdown marker after a successful shutdown to enable reusing their persistent volumes in case the ingester or store-gateway is restarted. #4985\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway, query-frontend: Reduced memory allocations when looking up cached entries from Memcached. #4862\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add additional template function `queryFromGeneratorURL` returning query URL decoded query from the `GeneratorURL` field of an alert. #4301\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added experimental ruler storage cache support. The cache should reduce the number of \"list objects\" API calls issued to the object storage when there are 2+ ruler replicas running in a Mimir cluster. The cache can be configured setting `-ruler-storage.cache.*` CLI flags or their respective YAML config options. #4950 #5054\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added HTTP `/store-gateway/prepare-shutdown` endpoint for gracefully scaling down of store-gateways. A gauge `cortex_store_gateway_prepare_shutdown_requested` has been introduced for tracing this process. #4955\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated Kuberesolver dependency (github.com/sercand/kuberesolver) from v2.4.0 to v4.0.0 and gRPC dependency (google.golang.org/grpc) from v1.47.0 to v1.53.0. #4922\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Introduced new options for logging HTTP request headers: `-server.log-request-headers` enables logging HTTP request headers, `-server.log-request-headers-exclude-list` lists headers which should not be logged. #4922\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Block upload: `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/files` endpoint now disables read and write HTTP timeout, overriding `-server.http-read-timeout` and `-server.http-write-timeout` values. This is done to allow large file uploads to succeed. #4956\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Introduce new metrics from upstream. #4918\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_notifications_failed_total` (added `reason` label)\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_nflog_maintenance_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_nflog_maintenance_errors_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_silences_maintenance_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_silences_maintenance_errors_total`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add native histogram support for `cortex_request_duration_seconds` metric family. #4987\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: do not list rule groups in the object storage for disabled tenants. #5004\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend and querier: add HTTP API endpoint `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/format_query` to format a PromQL query. #4373\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Add `cortex_query_frontend_regexp_matcher_count` and `cortex_query_frontend_regexp_matcher_optimized_count` metrics to track optimization of regular expression label matchers. #4813\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add configuration option to enable or disable the deletion of alertmanager state from object storage. This is useful when migrating alertmanager tenants from one cluster to another, because it avoids a condition where the state object is copied but then deleted before the configuration object is copied. #4989\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: only use the minimum set of chunks from ingesters when querying, and cancel unnecessary requests to ingesters sooner if we know their results won't be used. #5016\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `-enable-go-runtime-metrics` flag to expose all go runtime metrics as Prometheus metrics. #5009\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: trigger a synchronization of tenant's rule groups as soon as they change the rules configuration via API. This synchronization is in addition of the periodic syncing done every `-ruler.poll-interval`. The new behavior is enabled by default, but can be disabled with `-ruler.sync-rules-on-changes-enabled=false` (configurable on a per-tenant basis too). If you disable the new behaviour, then you may want to revert `-ruler.poll-interval` to `1m`. #4975 #5053 #5115 #5170\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Improve invalid tenant shard size error message. #5024\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: record index header loading time separately in `cortex_bucket_store_series_request_stage_duration_seconds{stage=\"load_index_header\"}`. Now index header loading will be visible in the \"Mimir / Queries\" dashboard in the \"Series request p99/average latency\" panels. #5011 #5062\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier and ingester: add experimental support for streaming chunks from ingesters to queriers while evaluating queries. This can be enabled with `-querier.prefer-streaming-chunks=true`. #4886 #5078 #5094 #5126\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Docker base images from `alpine:3.17.3` to `alpine:3.18.0`. #5065\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: reduced the number of \"object exists\" API calls issued by the compactor to the object storage when syncing block's `meta.json` files. #5063\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Push request rate limits (`-distributor.request-rate-limit` and `-distributor.request-burst-size`) and their associated YAML configuration are now stable. #5124\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Go: updated to 1.20.5. #5185\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update alpine base image to 3.18.2. #5274 #5276\n* [BUGFIX] Metadata API: Mimir will now return an empty object when no metadata is available, matching Prometheus. #4782\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: add collision detection on expanded postings and individual postings cache keys. #4770\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Support the `type=alert|record` query parameter for the API endpoint `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/rules`. #4302\n* [BUGFIX] Backend: Check that alertmanager's data-dir doesn't overlap with bucket-sync dir. #4921\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Allow to rate-limit webex, telegram and discord notifications. #4979\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: panics when decoding LabelValues responses that contain more than 655360 values. These responses are no longer cached. #5021\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: don't leak memory when processing query requests from query-frontends (ie. when the query-scheduler is disabled). #5199\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improve `MimirIngesterReachingTenantsLimit` runbook. #4744 #4752\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `symbol table size exceeds` case to `MimirCompactorHasNotSuccessfullyRunCompaction` runbook. #4945\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Clarify which APIs use query sharding. #4948\n\n### Mixin\n\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: Remove `MimirQuerierHighRefetchRate`. #4980\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: Remove `MimirTenantHasPartialBlocks`. This is obsoleted by the changed default of `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay` to `1d`, which will auto remediate this alert. #5026\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager dashboard: display active aggregation groups #4772\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: `MimirIngesterTSDBWALCorrupted` now only fires when there are more than one corrupted WALs in single-zone deployments and when there are more than two zones affected in multi-zone deployments. #4920\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: added labels to duplicated `MimirRolloutStuck` and `MimirCompactorHasNotUploadedBlocks` rules in order to distinguish them. #5023\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: fix holes in graph for lightly loaded clusters #4915\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: allow configuring additional services for the Rollout Progress dashboard. #5007\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: do not fire `MimirAllocatingTooMuchMemory` alert for any matching container outside of namespaces where Mimir is running. #5089\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: show cancelled requests in a different color to successful requests in throughput panels on dashboards. #5039\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: fix dashboard panels that showed percentages with axes from 0 to 10000%. #5084\n* [BUGFIX] Remove dependency on upstream Kubernetes mixin. #4732\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: changed ruler autoscaling policy, extended scale down period from 60s to 600s. #4786\n* [CHANGE] Update to v0.5.0 rollout-operator. #4893\n* [CHANGE] Backend: add `alertmanager_args` to `mimir-backend` when running in read-write deployment mode. Remove hardcoded `filesystem` alertmanager storage. This moves alertmanager's data-dir to `/data/alertmanager` by default. #4907 #4921\n* [CHANGE] Remove `-pdb` suffix from `PodDisruptionBudget` names. This will create new `PodDisruptionBudget` resources. Make sure to prune the old resources; otherwise, rollouts will be blocked. #5109\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: enable query sharding for cardinality estimation via `-query-frontend.query-sharding-target-series-per-shard` by default if the results cache is enabled. #5128\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: configure `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-compaction-interval=15m` to spread TSDB head compaction over a wider time range. #4870\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: configure `-blocks-storage.tsdb.wal-replay-concurrency` to CPU request minus 1. #4864\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: configure `-compactor.first-level-compaction-wait-period` to TSDB head compaction interval plus 10 minutes. #4872\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: set `GOMEMLIMIT` to the memory request value. This should reduce the likelihood the store-gateway may go out of memory, at the cost of an higher CPU utilization due to more frequent garbage collections when the memory utilization gets closer or above the configured requested memory. #4971\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: dynamically set `GOMAXPROCS` based on the CPU request. This should reduce the likelihood a high load on the store-gateway will slow down the entire Kubernetes node. #5104\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add `store_gateway_lazy_loading_enabled` configuration option which combines disabled lazy-loading and reducing blocks sync concurrency. Reducing blocks sync concurrency improves startup times with disabled lazy loading on HDDs. #5025\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update `rollout-operator` image to `v0.6.0`. #5155\n* [BUGFIX] Backend: configure `-ruler.alertmanager-url` to `mimir-backend` when running in read-write deployment mode. #4892\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: don't overwrite upsteam memcached statefulset jsonnet to allow chosing between antiAffinity and topologySpreadConstraints.\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [CHANGE] check rules: will fail on duplicate rules when `--strict` is provided. #5035\n* [FEATURE] sync/diff can now include/exclude namespaces based on a regular expression using `--namespaces-regex` and `--ignore-namespaces-regex`. #5100\n* [ENHANCEMENT] analyze prometheus: allow to specify `-prometheus-http-prefix`. #4966\n* [ENHANCEMENT] analyze grafana: allow to specify `--folder-title` to limit dashboards analysis based on their exact folder title. #4973\n\n### Tools\n\n* [CHANGE] copyblocks: copying between Azure Blob Storage buckets is now supported in addition to copying between Google Cloud Storage buckets. As a result, the `--service` flag is now required to be specified (accepted values are `gcs` or `abs`). #4756\n\n## 2.8.0\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: changed experimental CLI flag from `-out-of-order-blocks-external-label-enabled` to `-ingester.out-of-order-blocks-external-label-enabled` #4440\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: The following metrics have been removed: #4332\n  * `cortex_bucket_store_series_get_all_duration_seconds`\n  * `cortex_bucket_store_series_merge_duration_seconds`\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: changed default value of `-blocks-storage.tsdb.retention-period` from `24h` to `13h`. If you're running Mimir with a custom configuration and you're overriding `-querier.query-store-after` to a value greater than the default `12h` then you should increase `-blocks-storage.tsdb.retention-period` accordingly. #4382\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: the configuration parameter `-blocks-storage.tsdb.max-tsdb-opening-concurrency-on-startup` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.10. #4445\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: Cached results now contain timestamp which allows Mimir to check if cached results are still valid based on current TTL configured for tenant. Results cached by previous Mimir version are used until they expire from cache, which can take up to 7 days. If you need to use per-tenant TTL sooner, please flush results cache manually. #4439\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: the `cortex_ingester_tsdb_wal_replay_duration_seconds` metrics has been removed. #4465\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend and ruler: use protobuf internal query result payload format by default. This feature is no longer considered experimental. #4557 #4709\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: reject creating federated rule groups while tenant federation is disabled. Previously the rule groups would be silently dropped during bucket sync. #4555\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: the `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/finish` endpoint now returns a `429` status code when the compactor has reached the limit specified by `-compactor.max-block-upload-validation-concurrency`. #4598\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: when starting a block upload the maximum byte size of the block metadata provided in the request body is now limited to 1 MiB. If this limit is exceeded a `413` status code is returned. #4683\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: cache key format for expanded postings has changed. This will invalidate the expanded postings in the index cache when deployed. #4667\n* [FEATURE] Cache: Introduce experimental support for using Redis for results, chunks, index, and metadata caches. #4371\n* [FEATURE] Vault: Introduce experimental integration with Vault to fetch secrets used to configure TLS for clients. Server TLS secrets will still be read from a file. `tls-ca-path`, `tls-cert-path` and `tls-key-path` will denote the path in Vault for the following CLI flags when `-vault.enabled` is true: #4446.\n  * `-distributor.ha-tracker.etcd.*`\n  * `-distributor.ring.etcd.*`\n  * `-distributor.forwarding.grpc-client.*`\n  * `-querier.store-gateway-client.*`\n  * `-ingester.client.*`\n  * `-ingester.ring.etcd.*`\n  * `-querier.frontend-client.*`\n  * `-query-frontend.grpc-client-config.*`\n  * `-query-frontend.results-cache.redis.*`\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-cache.redis.*`\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.redis.*`\n  * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.metadata-cache.redis.*`\n  * `-compactor.ring.etcd.*`\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.etcd.*`\n  * `-ruler.client.*`\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.*`\n  * `-ruler.ring.etcd.*`\n  * `-ruler.query-frontend.grpc-client-config.*`\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.etcd.*`\n  * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.*`\n  * `-memberlist.*`\n  * `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.*`\n  * `-query-scheduler.ring.etcd.*`\n  * `-overrides-exporter.ring.etcd.*`\n* [FEATURE] Distributor, ingester, querier, query-frontend, store-gateway: add experimental support for native histograms. Requires that the experimental protobuf query result response format is enabled by `-query-frontend.query-result-response-format=protobuf` on the query frontend. #4286 #4352 #4354 #4376 #4377 #4387 #4396 #4425 #4442 #4494 #4512 #4513 #4526\n* [FEATURE] Added `-<prefix>.s3.storage-class` flag to configure the S3 storage class for objects written to S3 buckets. #4300\n* [FEATURE] Add `freebsd` to the target OS when generating binaries for a Mimir release. #4654\n* [FEATURE] Ingester: Add `prepare-shutdown` endpoint which can be used as part of Kubernetes scale down automations. #4718\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add timezone information to Alpine Docker images. #4583\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Sync rules when ruler JOINING the ring instead of ACTIVE, In order to reducing missed rule iterations during ruler restarts. #4451\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow to define service name used for tracing via `JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable. #4394\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier and query-frontend: add experimental, more performant protobuf query result response format enabled with `-query-frontend.query-result-response-format=protobuf`. #4304 #4318 #4375\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: added experimental configuration parameter `-compactor.first-level-compaction-wait-period`, to configure how long the compactor should wait before compacting 1st level blocks (uploaded by ingesters). This configuration option allows to reduce the chances compactor begins compacting blocks before all ingesters have uploaded their blocks to the storage. #4401\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: use more efficient chunks fetching and caching. #4255\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend and ruler: add experimental, more performant protobuf internal query result response format enabled with `-ruler.query-frontend.query-result-response-format=protobuf`. #4331\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: increased tolerance for missed iterations on alerts, reducing the chances of flapping firing alerts during ruler restarts. #4432\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Optimized `.*` and `.+` regular expression label matchers. #4432\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Optimized regular expression label matchers with alternates (e.g. `a|b|c`). #4647\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added an in-memory cache for regular expression matchers, to avoid parsing and compiling the same expression multiple times when used in recurring queries. #4633\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: results cache TTL is now configurable by using `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl` and `-query-frontend.results-cache-ttl-for-out-of-order-time-window` options. These values can also be specified per tenant. Default values are unchanged (7 days and 10 minutes respectively). #4385\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added advanced configuration parameter `-blocks-storage.tsdb.wal-replay-concurrency` representing the maximum number of CPUs used during WAL replay. #4445\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added metrics `cortex_ingester_tsdb_open_duration_seconds_total` to measure the total time it takes to open all existing TSDBs. The time tracked by this metric also includes the TSDBs WAL replay duration. #4465\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: use streaming implementation for LabelNames RPC. The batch size for streaming is controlled by `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.batch-series-size`. #4464\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: Add support for TLS or mTLS connections to cache servers. #4535\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: blocks index files are now validated for correctness for blocks uploaded via the TSDB block upload feature. #4503\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: block chunks and segment files are now validated for correctness for blocks uploaded via the TSDB block upload feature. #4549\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added configuration options to configure the \"postings for matchers\" cache of each compacted block queried from ingesters: #4561\n  * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.block-postings-for-matchers-cache-ttl`\n  * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.block-postings-for-matchers-cache-size`\n  * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.block-postings-for-matchers-cache-force`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: validation of blocks uploaded via the TSDB block upload feature is now configurable on a per tenant basis: #4585\n  * `-compactor.block-upload-validation-enabled` has been added, `compactor_block_upload_validation_enabled` can be used to override per tenant\n  * `-compactor.block-upload.block-validation-enabled` was the previous global flag and has been removed\n* [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB Block Upload: block upload validation concurrency can now be limited with `-compactor.max-block-upload-validation-concurrency`. #4598\n* [ENHANCEMENT] OTLP: Add support for converting OTel exponential histograms to Prometheus native histograms. The ingestion of native histograms must be enabled, please set `-ingester.native-histograms-ingestion-enabled` to `true`. #4063 #4639\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: add metric `cortex_query_fetched_index_bytes_total` to measure TSDB index bytes fetched to execute a query. #4597\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: add experimental limit to enforce a max query expression size in bytes via `-query-frontend.max-query-expression-size-bytes` or `max_query_expression_size_bytes`. #4604\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-tee: improve message logged when comparing responses and one response contains a non-JSON payload. #4588\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: add ability to set per-distributor limits via `distributor_limits` block in runtime configuration in addition to the existing configuration. #4619\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: reduce peak memory consumption for queries that touch a large number of chunks. #4625\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: added experimental `-query-frontend.query-sharding-max-regexp-size-bytes` limit to query-frontend. When set to a value greater than 0, query-frontend disabled query sharding for any query with a regexp matcher longer than the configured limit. #4632\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: include statistics from LabelValues and LabelNames calls in `cortex_bucket_store_series*` metrics. #4673\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: improve readability of distributed tracing spans. #4656\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Docker base images from `alpine:3.17.2` to `alpine:3.17.3`. #4685\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: improve performance when shuffle sharding is enabled and the shard size is large. #4711\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: improve performance when Active Series Tracker is in use. #4717\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: optionally select `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.series-selection-strategy`, which can limit the impact of large posting lists (when many series share the same label name and value). #4667 #4695 #4698\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: Cache the converted float histogram from chunk iterator, hence there is no need to lookup chunk every time to get the converted float histogram. #4684\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Improve rule upload performance when not enforcing per-tenant rule group limits. #4828\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved memory limit on the in-memory cache used for regular expression matchers. #4751\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: Streaming remote read will now continue to return multiple chunks per frame after the first frame. #4423\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: the values for `stage=\"processed\"` for the metrics `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_touched` and  `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_size_touched_bytes` when using fine-grained chunks caching is now reporting the correct values of chunks held in memory. #4449\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: fixed reporting a compaction error when compactor is correctly shut down while populating blocks. #4580\n* [BUGFIX] OTLP: Do not drop exemplars of the OTLP Monotonic Sum metric. #4063\n* [BUGFIX] Packaging: flag `/etc/default/mimir` and `/etc/sysconfig/mimir` as config to prevent overwrite. #4587\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: don't retry queries which error inside PromQL. #4643\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway & query-frontend: report more consistent statistics for fetched index bytes. #4671\n* [BUGFIX] Native histograms: fix how IsFloatHistogram determines if mimirpb.Histogram is a float histogram. #4706\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix query sharding for native histograms. #4666\n* [BUGFIX] Ring status page: fixed the owned tokens percentage value displayed. #4730\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed chunk iterator that can return sample with wrong timestamp. #4450\n* [BUGFIX] Packaging: fix preremove script preventing upgrades. #4801\n* [BUGFIX] Security: updates Go to version 1.20.4 to fix CVE-2023-24539, CVE-2023-24540, CVE-2023-29400. #4903\n\n### Mixin\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Queries: Display data touched per sec in bytes instead of number of items. #4492\n* [ENHANCEMENT] `_config.job_names.<job>` values can now be arrays of regular expressions in addition to a single string. Strings are still supported and behave as before. #4543\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Queries dashboard: remove mention to store-gateway \"streaming enabled\" in panels because store-gateway only support streaming series since Mimir 2.7. #4569\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add panel description for Read QPS panel in Ruler dashboard to explain values when in remote ruler mode. #4675\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler dashboard: show data for reads from ingesters. #4543\n* [BUGFIX] Pod selector regex for deployments: change `(.*-mimir-)` to `(.*mimir-)`. #4603\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: changed ruler deployment max surge from `0` to `50%`, and max unavailable from `1` to `0`. #4381\n* [CHANGE] Memcached connections parameters `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-cache.memcached.max-idle-connections`, `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.memcached.max-idle-connections` and `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.metadata-cache.memcached.max-idle-connections` settings are now configured based on `max-get-multi-concurrency` and `max-async-concurrency`. #4591\n* [CHANGE] Add support to use external Redis as cache. Following are some changes in the jsonnet config: #4386 #4640\n  * Renamed `memcached_*_enabled` config options to `cache_*_enabled`\n  * Renamed `memcached_*_max_item_size_mb` config options to `cache_*_max_item_size_mb`\n  * Added `cache_*_backend` config options\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway StatefulSets with disabled multi-zone deployment are also unregistered from the ring on shutdown. This eliminated resharding during rollouts, at the cost of extra effort during scaling down store-gateways. For more information see [Scaling down store-gateways](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/v2.7.x/operators-guide/run-production-environment/scaling-out/#scaling-down-store-gateways). #4713\n* [CHANGE] Removed `$._config.querier.replicas` and `$._config.queryFrontend.replicas`. If you need to customize the number of querier or query-frontend replicas, and autoscaling is disabled, please set an override as is done for other stateless components (e.g. distributors). #5130\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: add `alertmanager_data_disk_size` and  `alertmanager_data_disk_class` configuration options, by default no storage class is set. #4389\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update `rollout-operator` to `v0.4.0`. #4524\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update memcached to `memcached:1.6.19-alpine`. #4581\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add support for mTLS connections to Memcached servers. #4553\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update the `memcached-exporter` to `v0.11.2`. #4570\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Autoscaling: Add `autoscaling_query_frontend_memory_target_utilization`, `autoscaling_ruler_query_frontend_memory_target_utilization`, and `autoscaling_ruler_memory_target_utilization` configuration options, for controlling the corresponding autoscaler memory thresholds. Each has a default of 1, i.e. 100%. #4612\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: add ability to set per-distributor limits via `distributor_instance_limits` using runtime configuration. #4627\n* [BUGFIX] Add missing query sharding settings for user_24M and user_32M plans. #4374\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Backfill: mimirtool will now sleep and retry if it receives a 429 response while trying to finish an upload due to validation concurrency limits. #4598\n* [ENHANCEMENT] `gauge` panel type is supported now in `mimirtool analyze dashboard`. #4679\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Set a `User-Agent` header on requests to Mimir or Prometheus servers. #4700\n\n### Mimir Continuous Test\n\n* [FEATURE] Allow continuous testing of native histograms as well by enabling the flag `-tests.write-read-series-test.histogram-samples-enabled`. The metrics exposed by the tool will now have a new label called `type` with possible values of `float`, `histogram_float_counter`, `histogram_float_gauge`, `histogram_int_counter`, `histogram_int_gauge`, the list of metrics impacted: #4457\n  * `mimir_continuous_test_writes_total`\n  * `mimir_continuous_test_writes_failed_total`\n  * `mimir_continuous_test_queries_total`\n  * `mimir_continuous_test_queries_failed_total`\n  * `mimir_continuous_test_query_result_checks_total`\n  * `mimir_continuous_test_query_result_checks_failed_total`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added a new metric `mimir_continuous_test_build_info` that reports version information, similar to the existing `cortex_build_info` metric exposed by other Mimir components. #4712\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add coherency for the selected ranges and instants of test queries. #4704\n\n### Query-tee\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [CHANGE] Clarify what deprecation means in the lifecycle of configuration parameters. #4499\n* [CHANGE] Update compactor `split-groups` and `split-and-merge-shards` recommendation on component page. #4623\n* [FEATURE] Add instructions about how to configure native histograms. #4527\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Runbook for MimirCompactorHasNotSuccessfullyRunCompaction extended to include scenario where compaction has fallen behind. #4609\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add explanation for QPS values for reads in remote ruler mode and writes generally, to the Ruler dashboard page. #4629\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Expand zone-aware replication page to cover single physical availability zone deployments. #4631\n* [FEATURE] Add instructions to use puppet module. #4610\n* [FEATURE] Add documentation on how deploy mixin with terraform. #4161\n\n### Tools\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] tsdb-index: iteration over index is now faster when any equal matcher is supplied. #4515\n\n## 2.7.3\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [BUGFIX] Security: updates Go to version 1.20.4 to fix CVE-2023-24539, CVE-2023-24540, CVE-2023-29400. #4905\n\n## 2.7.2\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [BUGFIX] Security: updated Go version to 1.20.3 to fix CVE-2023-24538 #4795\n\n## 2.7.1\n\n**Note**: During the release process, version 2.7.0 was tagged too early, before completing the release checklist and production testing. Release 2.7.1 doesn't include any code changes since 2.7.0, but now has proper release notes, published documentation, and has been fully tested in our production environment.\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: the configuration parameter `-ingester.ring.readiness-check-ring-health` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.9. #4422\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: changed default value of `-ruler.evaluation-delay-duration` option from 0 to 1m. #4250\n* [CHANGE] Querier: Errors with status code `422` coming from the store-gateway are propagated and not converted to the consistency check error anymore. #4100\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: When a query hits `max_fetched_chunks_per_query` and `max_fetched_series_per_query` limits, an error with the status code `422` is created and returned. #4056\n* [CHANGE] Packaging: Migrate FPM packaging solution to NFPM. Rationalize packages dependencies and add package for all binaries. #3911\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Deprecate flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.subrange-size` since there's no benefit to changing the default of `16000`. #4135\n* [CHANGE] Experimental support for ephemeral storage introduced in Mimir 2.6.0 has been removed. Following options are no longer available: #4252\n  * `-blocks-storage.ephemeral-tsdb.*`\n  * `-distributor.ephemeral-series-enabled`\n  * `-distributor.ephemeral-series-matchers`\n  * `-ingester.max-ephemeral-series-per-user`\n  * `-ingester.instance-limits.max-ephemeral-series`\nQuerying with using `{__mimir_storage__=\"ephemeral\"}` selector no longer works. All label values with `ephemeral-` prefix in `reason` label of `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metric are no longer available. Following metrics have been removed:\n  * `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series`\n  * `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series_created_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series_removed_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_ingested_ephemeral_samples_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_ingested_ephemeral_samples_failures_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_memory_ephemeral_users`\n  * `cortex_ingester_queries_ephemeral_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_samples`\n  * `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_series`\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: use mmap-less index-header reader by default and remove mmap-based index header reader. The following flags have changed: #4280\n   * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.map-populate-enabled` has been removed\n   * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.stream-reader-enabled` has been removed\n   * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.stream-reader-max-idle-file-handles` has been renamed to `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.max-idle-file-handles`, and the corresponding configuration file option has been renamed from `stream_reader_max_idle_file_handles` to `max_idle_file_handles`\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: the streaming store-gateway is now enabled by default. The new default setting for `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.batch-series-size` is `5000`. #4330\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: the configuration parameter `-compactor.consistency-delay` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.9. #4409\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: the configuration parameter `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.consistency-delay` has been deprecated and will be removed in Mimir 2.9. #4409\n* [FEATURE] Ruler: added `keep_firing_for` support to alerting rules. #4099\n* [FEATURE] Distributor, ingester: ingestion of native histograms. The new per-tenant limit `-ingester.native-histograms-ingestion-enabled` controls whether native histograms are stored or ignored. #4159\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: Introduce experimental `-query-frontend.query-sharding-target-series-per-shard` to allow query sharding to take into account cardinality of similar requests executed previously. This feature uses the same cache that's used for results caching. #4121 #4177 #4188 #4254\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Go: update go to 1.20.1. #4266\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added `out_of_order_blocks_external_label_enabled` shipper option to label out-of-order blocks before shipping them to cloud storage. #4182 #4297\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: introduced concurrency when loading per-tenant rules configuration. This improvement is expected to speed up the ruler start up time in a Mimir cluster with a large number of tenants. #4258\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Add `reason` label to `cortex_compactor_runs_failed_total`. The value can be `shutdown` or `error`. #4012\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: enforce `max_fetched_series_per_query`. #4056\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Disambiguate logs for failed queries. #4067\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: log caller user agent in query stats logs. #4093\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add `data_type` label with values on `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_extended_ranges_total`, `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_expanded_ranges_total`, `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_requested_ranges_total`, `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_expanded_bytes_total`, `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_requested_bytes_total` for `postings`, `series`, and `chunks`. #4095\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Reduce memory allocation rate when loading TSDB chunks from Memcached. #4074\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: track `cortex_frontend_query_response_codec_duration_seconds` and `cortex_frontend_query_response_codec_payload_bytes` metrics to measure the time taken and bytes read / written while encoding and decoding query result payloads. #4110\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: expose additional upstream metrics `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_aggregation_groups`, `cortex_alertmanager_dispatcher_alert_processing_duration_seconds`. #4151\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier and query-frontend: add experimental, more performant protobuf internal query result response format enabled with `-query-frontend.query-result-response-format=protobuf`. #4153\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: use more efficient chunks fetching and caching. This should reduce CPU, memory utilization, and receive bandwidth of a store-gateway. Enable with `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.fine-grained-chunks-caching-enabled=true`. #4163 #4174 #4227\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Wait for in-flight queries to finish before shutting down. #4073 #4170\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added `encode` and `other` stage to `cortex_bucket_store_series_request_stage_duration_seconds` metric. #4179\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: log state of TSDB when shipping or forced compaction can't be done due to unexpected state of TSDB. #4211\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Docker base images from `alpine:3.17.1` to `alpine:3.17.2`. #4240\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add a `stage` label to the metrics `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_fetched`, `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_size_fetched_bytes`, `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_touched`, `cortex_bucket_store_series_data_size_touched_bytes`. This label only applies to `data_type=\"chunks\"`. For `fetched` metrics with `data_type=\"chunks\"` the `stage` label has 2 values: `fetched` - the chunks or bytes that were fetched from the cache or the object store, `refetched` - the chunks or bytes that had to be refetched from the cache or the object store because their size was underestimated during the first fetch. For `touched` metrics with `data_type=\"chunks\"` the `stage` label has 2 values: `processed` - the chunks or bytes that were read from the fetched chunks or bytes and were processed in memory, `returned` - the chunks or bytes that were selected from the processed bytes to satisfy the query. #4227 #4316\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: improve the partial block check related to `compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay` to potentially issue less requests to object storage. #4246\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memcached: added `-*.memcached.min-idle-connections-headroom-percentage` support to configure the minimum number of idle connections to keep open as a percentage (0-100) of the number of recently used idle connections. This feature is disabled when set to a negative value (default), which means idle connections are kept open indefinitely. #4249\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier and store-gateway: optimized regular expression label matchers with case insensitive alternate operator. #4340 #4357\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: added the experimental flag `-compactor.block-upload.block-validation-enabled` with the default `true` to configure whether block validation occurs on backfilled blocks. #3411\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: apply a jitter to the first TSDB head compaction interval configured via `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-compaction-interval`. Subsequent checks will happen at the configured interval. This should help to spread the TSDB head compaction among different ingesters over the configured interval. #4364\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: the maximum accepted value for `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-compaction-interval` has been increased from 5m to 15m. #4364\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: return `Canceled` rather than `Aborted` or `Internal` error when the calling querier cancels a label names or values request, and return `Internal` if processing the request fails for another reason. #4061\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: track canceled requests with status code `499` in the metrics instead of `503` or `422`. #4099\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: compact out-of-order data during `/ingester/flush` or when TSDB is idle. #4180\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: conversion of global limits `max-series-per-user`, `max-series-per-metric`, `max-metadata-per-user` and `max-metadata-per-metric` into corresponding local limits now takes into account the number of ingesters in each zone. #4238\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: track `cortex_ingester_memory_series` metric consistently with `cortex_ingester_memory_series_created_total` and `cortex_ingester_memory_series_removed_total`. #4312\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed a bug which was incorrectly matching series with regular expression label matchers with begin/end anchors in the middle of the regular expression. #4340\n\n### Mixin\n\n* [CHANGE] Move auto-scaling panel rows down beneath logical network path in Reads and Writes dashboards. #4049\n* [CHANGE] Make distributor auto-scaling metric panels show desired number of replicas. #4218\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: The alert `MimirMemcachedRequestErrors` has been renamed to `MimirCacheRequestErrors`. #4242\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Added `MimirAutoscalerKedaFailing` alert firing when a KEDA scaler is failing. #4045\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add auto-scaling panels to ruler dashboard. #4046\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add gateway auto-scaling panels to Reads and Writes dashboards. #4049 #4216\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: distinguish between label names and label values queries. #4065\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add query-frontend and ruler-query-frontend auto-scaling panels to Reads and Ruler dashboards. #4199\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fixed `MimirAutoscalerNotActive` to not fire if scaling metric does not exist, to avoid false positives on scaled objects with 0 min replicas. #4045\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: `MimirCompactorHasNotSuccessfullyRunCompaction` is no longer triggered by frequent compactor restarts. #4012\n* [BUGFIX] Tenants dashboard: Correctly show the ruler-query-scheduler queue size. #4152\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] Create the `query-frontend-discovery` service only when Mimir is deployed in microservice mode without query-scheduler. #4353\n* [CHANGE] Add results cache backend config to `ruler-query-frontend` configuration to allow cache reuse for cardinality-estimation based sharding. #4257\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add support for ruler auto-scaling. #4046\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add optional `weight` param to `newQuerierScaledObject` and `newRulerQuerierScaledObject` to allow running multiple querier deployments on different node types. #4141\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add support for query-frontend and ruler-query-frontend auto-scaling. #4199\n* [BUGFIX] Shuffle sharding: when applying user class limits, honor the minimum shard size configured in `$._config.shuffle_sharding.*`. #4363\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [FEATURE] Added `keep_firing_for` support to rules configuration. #4099\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `-tls-insecure-skip-verify` to rules, alertmanager and backfill commands. #4162\n\n### Query-tee\n\n* [CHANGE] Increase default value of `-backend.read-timeout` to 150s, to accommodate default querier and query frontend timeout of 120s. #4262\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Log errors that occur while performing requests to compare two endpoints. #4262\n* [ENHANCEMENT] When comparing two responses that both contain an error, only consider the comparison failed if the errors differ. Previously, if either response contained an error, the comparison always failed, even if both responses contained the same error. #4262\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Include the value of the `X-Scope-OrgID` header when logging a comparison failure. #4262\n* [BUGFIX] Parameters (expression, time range etc.) for a query request where the parameters are in the HTTP request body rather than in the URL are now logged correctly when responses differ. #4265\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add guide on alternative migration method for Thanos to Mimir #3554\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Restore \"Migrate from Cortex\" for Jsonnet. #3929\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Document migration from microservices to read-write deployment mode. #3951\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Do not error when there is nothing to commit as part of a publish #4058\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Explain how to run Mimir locally using docker-compose #4079\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Docs: use long flag names in runbook commands. #4088\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Clarify how ingester replication happens. #4101\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improvements to the Get Started guide. #4315\n* [BUGFIX] Added indentation to Azure and SWIFT backend definition. #4263\n\n### Tools\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Adapt tsdb-print-chunk for native histograms. #4186\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Adapt tsdb-index-health for blocks containing native histograms. #4186\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Adapt tsdb-chunks tool to handle native histograms. #4186\n\n## 2.6.2\n\n* [BUGFIX] Security: updates Go to version 1.20.4 to fix CVE-2023-24539, CVE-2023-24540, CVE-2023-29400. #4903\n\n## 2.6.1\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [BUGFIX] Security: updates Go to version 1.20.3 to fix CVE-2023-24538 #4798\n\n## 2.6.0\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Querier: Introduce `-querier.max-partial-query-length` to limit the time range for partial queries at the querier level and deprecate `-store.max-query-length`. #3825 #4017\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Remove experimental `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-concurrent-reject-over-limit` flag. #3706\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: If shipping is enabled block retention will now be relative to the upload time to cloud storage. If shipping is disabled block retention will be relative to the creation time of the block instead of the mintime of the last block created. #3816\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: Deprecated CLI flag `-query-frontend.align-querier-with-step` has been removed. #3982\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: added default configuration for `-alertmanager.configs.fallback`. Allows tenants to send alerts without first uploading an Alertmanager configuration. #3541\n* [FEATURE] Store-gateway: streaming of series. The store-gateway can now stream results back to the querier instead of buffering them. This is expected to greatly reduce peak memory consumption while keeping latency the same. You can enable this feature by setting `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.batch-series-size` to a value in the high thousands (5000-10000). This is still an experimental feature and is subject to a changing API and instability. #3540 #3546 #3587 #3606 #3611 #3620 #3645 #3355 #3697 #3666 #3687 #3728 #3739 #3751 #3779 #3839\n* [FEATURE] Alertmanager: Added support for the Webex receiver. #3758\n* [FEATURE] Limits: Added the `-validation.separate-metrics-group-label` flag. This allows further separation of the `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metric by an additional `group` label - which is configured by this flag to be the value of a specific label on an incoming timeseries. Active groups are tracked and inactive groups are cleaned up on a defined interval. The maximum number of groups tracked is controlled by the `-max-separate-metrics-groups-per-user` flag. #3439\n* [FEATURE] Overrides-exporter: Added experimental ring support to overrides-exporter via `-overrides-exporter.ring.enabled`. When enabled, the ring is used to establish a leader replica for the export of limit override metrics. #3908 #3953\n* [FEATURE] Ephemeral storage (experimental): Mimir can now accept samples into \"ephemeral storage\". Such samples are available for querying for a short amount of time (`-blocks-storage.ephemeral-tsdb.retention-period`, defaults to 10 minutes), and then removed from memory. To use ephemeral storage, distributor must be configured with `-distributor.ephemeral-series-enabled` option. Series matching `-distributor.ephemeral-series-matchers` will be marked for storing into ephemeral storage in ingesters. Each tenant needs to have ephemeral storage enabled by using `-ingester.max-ephemeral-series-per-user` limit, which defaults to 0 (no ephemeral storage). Ingesters have new `-ingester.instance-limits.max-ephemeral-series` limit for total number of series in ephemeral storage across all tenants. If ingestion of samples into ephemeral storage fails, `cortex_discarded_samples_total` metric will use values prefixed with `ephemeral-` for `reason` label. Querying of ephemeral storage is possible by using `{__mimir_storage__=\"ephemeral\"}` as metric selector. Following new metrics related to ephemeral storage are introduced: #3897 #3922 #3961 #3997 #4004\n  * `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series`\n  * `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series_created_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_ephemeral_series_removed_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_ingested_ephemeral_samples_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_ingested_ephemeral_samples_failures_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_memory_ephemeral_users`\n  * `cortex_ingester_queries_ephemeral_total`\n  * `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_samples`\n  * `cortex_ingester_queried_ephemeral_series`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added new metric `thanos_shipper_last_successful_upload_time`: Unix timestamp (in seconds) of the last successful TSDB block uploaded to the bucket. #3627\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Added `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-enabled` configuration for alertmanager client. #3432 #3597\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Activity tracker logs now have `component=activity-tracker` label. #3556\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: remove labels with empty values #2439\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: track query HTTP requests in the Activity Tracker. #3561\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Add experimental alternate implementation of index-header reader that does not use memory mapped files. The index-header reader is expected to improve stability of the store-gateway. You can enable this implementation with the flag `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.stream-reader-enabled`. #3639 #3691 #3703 #3742 #3785 #3787 #3797\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: add `cortex_query_scheduler_cancelled_requests_total` metric to track the number of requests that are already cancelled when dequeued. #3696\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: add `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_extended_ranges_total` metric to keep track of the ranges that the partitioner decided to overextend and merge in order to save API call to the object storage. #3769\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Auto-forget unhealthy compactors after ten failed ring heartbeats. #3771\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: change default value of `-ruler.for-grace-period` from `10m` to `2m` and update help text. The new default value reflects how we operate Mimir at Grafana Labs. #3817\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Added experimental flags to force usage of _postings for matchers cache_. These flags will be removed in the future and it's not recommended to change them. #3823\n  * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-ttl`\n  * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-size`\n  * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-postings-for-matchers-cache-force`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Improved series selection performance when some of the matchers do not match any series. #3827\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add new additional template function `tenantID` returning id of the tenant owning the alert. #3758\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Add additional template function `grafanaExploreURL` returning URL to grafana explore with range query. #3849\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce overhead of debug logging when filtered out. #3875\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update Docker base images from `alpine:3.16.2` to `alpine:3.17.1`. #3898\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Add new `/ingester/tsdb_metrics` endpoint to return tenant-specific TSDB metrics. #3923\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: CLI flag `-query-frontend.max-total-query-length` and its associated YAML configuration is now stable. #3882\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: rule groups now support optional and experimental `align_evaluation_time_on_interval` field, which causes all evaluations to happen on interval-aligned timestamp. #4013\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: ring-based service discovery is now stable. #4028\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: improved performance of prefix matching on the labels. #4055 #4080\n* [BUGFIX] Log the names of services that are not yet running rather than `unsupported value type` when calling `/ready` and some services are not running. #3625\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Fix template spurious deletion with relative data dir. #3604\n* [BUGFIX] Security: update prometheus/exporter-toolkit for CVE-2022-46146. #3675\n* [BUGFIX] Security: update golang.org/x/net for CVE-2022-41717. #3755\n* [BUGFIX] Debian package: Fix post-install, environment file path and user creation. #3720\n* [BUGFIX] memberlist: Fix panic during Mimir startup when Mimir receives gossip message before it's ready. #3746\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: fix `cortex_bucket_store_partitioner_requested_bytes_total` metric to not double count overlapping ranges. #3769\n* [BUGFIX] Update `github.com/thanos-io/objstore` to address issue with Multipart PUT on s3-compatible Object Storage. #3802 #3821\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor, Query-scheduler: Make sure ring metrics include a `cortex_` prefix as expected by dashboards. #3809\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: canceled requests are no longer reported as \"consistency check\" failures. #3837 #3927\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: don't panic when `metric_relabel_configs` in overrides contains null element. #3868\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: don't panic when OTLP histograms don't have any buckets. #3853\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester, Compactor: fix panic that can occur when compaction fails. #3955\n* [BUGFIX] Store-gateway: return `Canceled` rather than `Aborted` error when the calling querier cancels the request. #4007\n\n### Mixin\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Added `MimirIngesterInstanceHasNoTenants` alert that fires when an ingester replica is not receiving write requests for any tenant. #3681\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Extended `MimirAllocatingTooMuchMemory` to check read-write deployment containers. #3710\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Added `MimirAlertmanagerInstanceHasNoTenants` alert that fires when an alertmanager instance ows no tenants. #3826\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Added `MimirRulerInstanceHasNoRuleGroups` alert that fires when a ruler replica is not assigned any rule group to evaluate. #3723\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Support for baremetal deployment for alerts and scaling recording rules. #3719\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: querier autoscaling now supports multiple scaled objects (configurable via `$._config.autoscale.querier.hpa_name`). #3962\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fixed `MimirIngesterRestarts` alert when Mimir is deployed in read-write mode. #3716\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fixed `MimirIngesterHasNotShippedBlocks` and `MimirIngesterHasNotShippedBlocksSinceStart` alerts for when Mimir is deployed in read-write or monolithic modes and updated them to use new `thanos_shipper_last_successful_upload_time` metric. #3627\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fixed `MimirMemoryMapAreasTooHigh` alert when Mimir is deployed in read-write mode. #3626\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fixed `MimirCompactorSkippedBlocksWithOutOfOrderChunks` matching on non-existent label. #3628\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Fix `Rollout Progress` dashboard incorrectly using Gateway metrics when Gateway was not enabled. #3709\n* [BUGFIX] Tenants dashboard: Make it compatible with all deployment types. #3754\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fixed `MimirCompactorHasNotUploadedBlocks` to not fire if compactor has nothing to do. #3793\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fixed `MimirAutoscalerNotActive` to not fire if scaling metric is 0, to avoid false positives on scaled objects with 0 min replicas. #3999\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] Replaced the deprecated `policy/v1beta1` with `policy/v1` when configuring a PodDisruptionBudget for read-write deployment mode. #3811\n* [CHANGE] Removed `-server.http-write-timeout` default option value from querier and query-frontend, as it defaults to a higher value in the code now, and cannot be lower than `-querier.timeout`. #3836\n* [CHANGE] Replaced `-store.max-query-length` with `-query-frontend.max-total-query-length` in the query-frontend config. #3879\n* [CHANGE] Changed default `mimir_backend_data_disk_size` from `100Gi` to `250Gi`. #3894\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update `rollout-operator` to `v0.2.0`. #3624\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `user_24M` and `user_32M` classes to operations config. #3367\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update memcached image from `memcached:1.6.16-alpine` to `memcached:1.6.17-alpine`. #3914\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow configuring the ring for overrides-exporter. #3995\n* [BUGFIX]

read-write deployment mode. #3790\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed `mimir-write` and `mimir-read` Kubernetes service to correctly balance requests among pods. #3855 #3864 #3906\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed `ruler-query-frontend` and `mimir-read` gRPC server configuration to force clients to periodically re-resolve the backend addresses. #3862\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed `mimir-read` CLI flags to ensure query-frontend configuration takes precedence over querier configuration. #3877\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update `mimirtool config convert` to work with Mimir 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 changes. #3952\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Mimirtool is now available to install through Homebrew with `brew install mimirtool`. #3776\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `--concurrency` to `mimirtool rules sync` command. #3996\n* [BUGFIX]

For example, `autoscaling.querier_enabled` becomes `autoscaling.querier.enabled`.\n* [FEATURE] Dashboards: Added \"Mimir / Overview resources\" dashboard, providing an high level view over a Mimir cluster resources utilization. #3481\n* [FEATURE] Dashboards: Added \"Mimir / Overview networking\" dashboard, providing an high level view over a Mimir cluster network bandwidth, inflight requests and TCP connections. #3487\n* [FEATURE] Compile baremetal mixin along k8s mixin. #3162 #3514\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Add MimirRingMembersMismatch firing when a component does not have the expected number of running jobs. #2404\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Add optional row about the Distributor's metric forwarding feature to the `Mimir / Writes` dashboard. #3182 #3394 #3394 #3461\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Remove the \"Instance Mapper\" row from the \"Alertmanager Resources Dashboard\". This is a Grafana Cloud specific service and not relevant for external users. #3152\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Add \"remote read\", \"metadata\", and \"exemplar\" queries to \"Mimir / Overview\" dashboard. #3245\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Use non-red colors for non-error series in the \"Mimir / Overview\" dashboard. #3246\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Add support to multi-zone deployments for the experimental read-write deployment mode. #3256\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: If enabled, add new row to the `Mimir / Writes` for distributor autoscaling metrics. #3378\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Add read path insights row to the \"Mimir / Tenants\" dashboard. #3326\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Add runbook urls for alerts. #3452\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Configuration: Make it possible to configure namespace label, job label, and job prefix. #3482\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: improved resources and networking dashboards to work with read-write deployment mode too. #3497 #3504 #3519 #3531\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Added \"MimirDistributorForwardingErrorRate\" alert, which fires on high error rates in the distributor’s forwarding feature. #3200\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improve phrasing in Overview dashboard. #3488\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Fix legend showing `persistentvolumeclaim` when using `deployment_type=baremetal` for `Disk space utilization` panels. #3173 #3184\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Fixed `MimirGossipMembersMismatch` alert when Mimir is deployed in read-write mode. #3489\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Remove \"Inflight requests\" from object store panels because the panel is not tracking the inflight requests to object storage. #3521\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] Replaced the deprecated `policy/v1beta1` with `policy/v1` when configuring a PodDisruptionBudget. #3284\n* [CHANGE] [Common storage configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/v2.3.x/operators-guide/configure/configure-object-storage-backend/#common-configuration) is now used to configure object storage in all components. This is a breaking change in terms of Jsonnet manifests and also a CLI flag update for components that use object storage, so it will require a rollout of those components. The changes include: #3257\n  * `blocks_storage_backend` was renamed to `storage_backend` and is now used as the common storage backend for all components.\n    * So were the related `blocks_storage_azure_account_(name|key)` and `blocks_storage_s3_endpoint` configurations.\n  * `storage_s3_endpoint` is now rendered by default using the `aws_region` configuration instead of a hardcoded `us-east-1`.\n  * `ruler_client_type` and `alertmanager_client_type` were renamed to `ruler_storage_backend` and `alertmanager_storage_backend` respectively, and their corresponding CLI flags won't be rendered unless explicitly set to a value different from the one in `storage_backend` (like `local`).\n  * `alertmanager_s3_bucket_name`, `alertmanager_gcs_bucket_name` and `alertmanager_azure_container_name` have been removed, and replaced by a single `alertmanager_storage_bucket_name` configuration used for all object storages.\n  * `genericBlocksStorageConfig` configuration object was removed, and so any extensions to it will be now ignored. Use `blockStorageConfig` instead.\n  * `rulerClientConfig` and `alertmanagerStorageClientConfig` configuration objects were renamed to `rulerStorageConfig` and `alertmanagerStorageConfig` respectively, and so any extensions to their previous names will be now ignored. Use the new names instead.\n  * The CLI flags `*.s3.region` are no longer rendered as they are optional and the region can be inferred by Mimir by performing an initial API call to the endpoint.\n  * The migration to this change should usually consist of:\n    * Renaming `blocks_storage_backend` key to `storage_backend`.\n    * For Azure/S3:\n      * Renaming `blocks_storage_(azure|s3)_*` configurations to `storage_(azure|s3)_*`.\n      * If `ruler_storage_(azure|s3)_*` and `alertmanager_storage_(azure|s3)_*` keys were different from the `block_storage_*` ones, they should be now provided using CLI flags, see [configuration reference](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/v2.3.x/operators-guide/configure/reference-configuration-parameters/) for more details.\n    * Removing `ruler_client_type` and `alertmanager_client_type` if their value match the `storage_backend`, or renaming them to their new names otherwise.\n    * Reviewing any possible extensions to `genericBlocksStorageConfig`, `rulerClientConfig` and `alertmanagerStorageClientConfig` and moving them to the corresponding new options.\n    * Renaming the alertmanager's bucket name configuration from provider-specific to the new `alertmanager_storage_bucket_name` key.\n* [CHANGE] The `overrides-exporter.libsonnet` file is now always imported. The overrides-exporter can be enabled in jsonnet setting the following: #3379\n  ```jsonnet\n  {\n    _config+:: {\n      overrides_exporter_enabled: true,\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* [FEATURE] Added support for experimental read-write deployment mode. Enabling the read-write deployment mode on a existing Mimir cluster is a destructive operation, because the cluster will be re-created. If you're creating a new Mimir cluster, you can deploy it in read-write mode adding the following configuration: #3379 #3475 #3405\n  ```jsonnet\n  {\n    _config+:: {\n      deployment_mode: 'read-write',\n\n      // See operations/mimir/read-write-deployment.libsonnet for more configuration options.\n      mimir_write_replicas: 3,\n      mimir_read_replicas: 2,\n      mimir_backend_replicas: 3,\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add autoscaling support to the `mimir-read` component when running the read-write-deployment model. #3419\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `$._config.usageStatsConfig` to track the installation mode via the anonymous usage statistics. #3294\n* [ENHANCEMENT] The query-tee node port (`$._config.query_tee_node_port`) is now optional. #3272\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add support for autoscaling distributors. #3378\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Make auto-scaling logic ensure integer KEDA thresholds. #3512\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed query-scheduler ring configuration for dedicated ruler's queries and query-frontends. #3237 #3239\n* [BUGFIX] Jsonnet: Fix auto-scaling so that ruler-querier CPU threshold is a string-encoded integer millicores value. #3520\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [FEATURE] Added `mimirtool alertmanager verify` command to validate configuration without uploading. #3440\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `mimirtool rules delete-namespace` command to delete all of the rule groups in a namespace including the namespace itself. #3136\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Refactor `mimirtool analyze prometheus`: add concurrency and resiliency #3349\n  * Add `--concurrency` flag. Default: number of logical CPUs\n* [BUGFIX] `--log.level=debug` now correctly prints the response from the remote endpoint when a request fails. #3180\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Documented how to configure HA deduplication using Consul in a Mimir Helm deployment. #2972\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improve `MimirQuerierAutoscalerNotActive` runbook. #3186\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improve `MimirSchedulerQueriesStuck` runbook to reflect debug steps with querier auto-scaling enabled. #3223\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Use imperative for docs titles. #3178 #3332 #3343\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Docs: mention gRPC compression in \"Production tips\". #3201\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Update ADOPTERS.md. #3224 #3225\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add a note for jsonnet deploying. #3213\n* [ENHANCEMENT] out-of-order runbook update with use case. #3253\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Fixed TSDB retention mentioned in the \"Recover source blocks from ingesters\" runbook. #3280\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Run Grafana Mimir in production using the Helm chart. #3072\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Use common configuration in the tutorial. #3282\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated detailed steps for migrating blocks from Thanos to Mimir. #3290\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add scheme to DNS service discovery docs. #3450\n* [BUGFIX] Remove reference to file that no longer exists in contributing guide. #3404\n* [BUGFIX] Fix some minor typos in the contributing guide and on the runbooks page. #3418\n* [BUGFIX] Fix small typos in API reference. #3526\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed TSDB retention mentioned in the \"Recover source blocks from ingesters\" runbook. #3278\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed configuration example in the \"Configuring the Grafana Mimir query-frontend to work with Prometheus\" guide. #3374\n\n### Tools\n\n* [FEATURE] Add `copyblocks` tool, to copy Mimir blocks between two GCS buckets. #3264\n* [ENHANCEMENT] copyblocks: copy no-compact global markers and optimize min time filter check. #3268\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Mimir rules GitHub action: Added the ability to change default value of `label` when running `prepare` command. #3236\n* [BUGFIX] Mimir rules Github action: Fix single line output. #3421\n\n## 2.4.0\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: change the default value of `-distributor.remote-timeout` to `2s` from `20s` and `-distributor.forwarding.request-timeout` to `2s` from `10s` to improve distributor resource usage when ingesters crash. #2728 #2912\n* [CHANGE] Anonymous usage statistics tracking: added the `-ingester.ring.store` value. #2981\n* [CHANGE] Series metadata `HELP` that is longer than `-validation.max-metadata-length` is now truncated silently, instead of being dropped with a 400 status code. #2993\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: changed default setting for `-ingester.ring.readiness-check-ring-health` from `true` to `false`. #2953\n* [CHANGE] Anonymous usage statistics tracking has been enabled by default, to help Mimir maintainers make better decisions to support the open source community. #2939 #3034\n* [CHANGE] Anonymous usage statistics tracking: added the minimum and maximum value of `-ingester.out-of-order-time-window`. #2940\n* [CHANGE] The default hash ring heartbeat period for distributors, ingesters, rulers and compactors has been increased from `5s` to `15s`. Now the default heartbeat period for all Mimir hash rings is `15s`. #3033\n* [CHANGE] Reduce the default TSDB head compaction concurrency (`-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-compaction-concurrency`) from 5 to 1, in order to reduce CPU spikes. #3093\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: the ruler's [remote evaluation mode](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/operators-guide/architecture/components/ruler/#remote) (`-ruler.query-frontend.address`) is now stable. #3109\n* [CHANGE] Limits: removed the deprecated YAML configuration option `active_series_custom_trackers_config`. Please use `active_series_custom_trackers` instead. #3110\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: removed the deprecated configuration option `-ingester.ring.join-after`. #3111\n* [CHANGE] Querier: removed the deprecated configuration option `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period`. The value of `-querier.query-ingesters-within` is now used internally for shuffle sharding lookback, while you can use `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-enabled` to enable or disable shuffle sharding on the read path. #3111\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: cluster label verification feature (`-memberlist.cluster-label` and `-memberlist.cluster-label-verification-disabled`) is now marked as stable. #3108\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: only single per-tenant forwarding endpoint can be configured now. Support for per-rule endpoint has been removed. #3095\n* [FEATURE] Query-scheduler: added an experimental ring-based service discovery support for the query-scheduler. Refer to [query-scheduler configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/next/operators-guide/architecture/components/query-scheduler/#configuration) for more information. #2957\n* [FEATURE] Introduced the experimental endpoint `/api/v1/user_limits` exposed by all components that load runtime configuration. This endpoint exposes realtime limits for the authenticated tenant, in JSON format. #2864 #3017\n* [FEATURE] Query-scheduler: added the experimental configuration option `-query-scheduler.max-used-instances` to restrict the number of query-schedulers effectively used regardless how many replicas are running. This feature can be useful when using the experimental read-write deployment mode. #3005\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Go: updated to go 1.19.2. #2637 #3127 #3129\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Runtime config: don't unmarshal runtime configuration files if they haven't changed. This can save a bit of CPU and memory on every component using runtime config. #2954\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Add `cortex_frontend_query_result_cache_skipped_total` and `cortex_frontend_query_result_cache_attempted_total` metrics to track the reason why query results are not cached. #2855\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: pool more connections per host when forwarding request. Mark requests as idempotent so they can be retried under some conditions. #2968\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: failure to send request to forwarding target now also increments `cortex_distributor_forward_errors_total`, with `status_code=\"failed\"`. #2968\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: added support forwarding push requests via gRPC, using `httpgrpc` messages from weaveworks/common library. #2996\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend / Querier: increase internal backoff period used to retry connections to query-frontend / query-scheduler. #3011\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: do not log \"error processing requests from scheduler\" when the query-scheduler is shutting down. #3012\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: query sharding process is now time-bounded and it is cancelled if the request is aborted. #3028\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: improved Prometheus response JSON encoding performance. #2450\n* [ENHANCEMENT] TLS: added configuration parameters to configure the client's TLS cipher suites and minimum version. The following new CLI flags have been added: #3070\n  * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.tls-min-version`\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.etcd.tls-min-version`\n  * `-compactor.ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-compactor.ring.etcd.tls-min-version`\n  * `-distributor.forwarding.grpc-client.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-distributor.forwarding.grpc-client.tls-min-version`\n  * `-distributor.ha-tracker.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-distributor.ha-tracker.etcd.tls-min-version`\n  * `-distributor.ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-distributor.ring.etcd.tls-min-version`\n  * `-ingester.client.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-ingester.client.tls-min-version`\n  * `-ingester.ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-ingester.ring.etcd.tls-min-version`\n  * `-memberlist.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-memberlist.tls-min-version`\n  * `-querier.frontend-client.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-querier.frontend-client.tls-min-version`\n  * `-querier.store-gateway-client.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-querier.store-gateway-client.tls-min-version`\n  * `-query-frontend.grpc-client-config.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-query-frontend.grpc-client-config.tls-min-version`\n  * `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.tls-min-version`\n  * `-query-scheduler.ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-query-scheduler.ring.etcd.tls-min-version`\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-ruler.alertmanager-client.tls-min-version`\n  * `-ruler.client.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-ruler.client.tls-min-version`\n  * `-ruler.query-frontend.grpc-client-config.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-ruler.query-frontend.grpc-client-config.tls-min-version`\n  * `-ruler.ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-ruler.ring.etcd.tls-min-version`\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.etcd.tls-cipher-suites`\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.etcd.tls-min-version`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Add `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.max-concurrent-reject-over-limit` option to allow requests that exceed the max number of inflight object storage requests to be rejected. #2999\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: allow setting a separate limit on the total (before splitting/sharding) query length of range queries with the new experimental `-query-frontend.max-total-query-length` flag, which defaults to `-store.max-query-length` if unset or set to 0. #3058\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Lower TTL for cache entries overlapping the out-of-order samples ingestion window (re-using `-ingester.out-of-order-allowance` from ingesters). #2935\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: added support to forcefully disable recording and/or alerting rules evaluation. The following new configuration options have been introduced, which can be overridden on a per-tenant basis in the runtime configuration: #3088\n  * `-ruler.recording-rules-evaluation-enabled`\n  * `-ruler.alerting-rules-evaluation-enabled`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Improved error messages reported when the distributor fails to remote write to ingesters. #3055\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved tracing spans tracked by distributors, ingesters and store-gateways. #2879 #3099 #3089\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: improved the performance of label value cardinality endpoint. #3044\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: use backoff retry on remote evaluation #3098\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: Include multiple tenant IDs in query logs when present instead of dropping them. #3125\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: truncate queries based on the configured blocks retention period (`-compactor.blocks-retention-period`) to avoid querying past this period. #3134\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: reduced memory utilization in Mimir clusters with a large number of tenants. #3143\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added extra span logging to improve observability. #3131\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: cleaning up different tenants' old blocks and updating bucket indexes is now more independent. This prevents a single tenant from delaying cleanup for other tenants. #2631\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: request rate, ingestion rate, and inflight requests limits are now enforced before reading and parsing the body of the request. This makes the distributor more resilient against a burst of requests over those limit. #2419\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: Fix 400 response while handling streaming remote read. #2963\n* [BUGFIX] Fix a bug causing query-frontend, query-scheduler, and querier not failing if one of their internal components fail. #2978\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: re-balance the querier worker connections when a query-frontend or query-scheduler is terminated. #3005\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: Now returns the quorum error from ingesters. For example, with replication_factor=3, two HTTP 400 errors and one HTTP 500 error, now the distributor will always return HTTP 400. Previously the behaviour was to return the error which the distributor first received. #2979\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix panic when ruler.external_url is explicitly set to an empty string (\"\") in YAML. #2915\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Fix support for the Telegram API URL in the global settings. #3097\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: Fix parsing of label matchers without label value in the API used to retrieve alerts. #3097\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: Fix not restoring alert state for rule groups when other ruler replicas shut down. #3156\n* [BUGFIX] Updated `golang.org/x/net` dependency to fix CVE-2022-27664. #3124\n* [BUGFIX] Fix distributor from returning a `500` status code when a `400` was received from the ingester. #3211\n* [BUGFIX] Fix incorrect OS value set in Mimir v2.3.* RPM packages. #3221\n\n### Mixin\n\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: MimirQuerierAutoscalerNotActive is now critical and fires after 1h instead of 15m. #2958\n* [FEATURE] Dashboards: Added \"Mimir / Overview\" dashboards, providing an high level view over a Mimir cluster. #3122 #3147 #3155\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Updated the \"Writes\" and \"Rollout progress\" dashboards to account for samples ingested via the new OTLP ingestion endpoint. #2919 #2938\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Include per-tenant request rate in \"Tenants\" dashboard. #2874\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Include inflight object store requests in \"Reads\" dashboard. #2914\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Make queries used to find job, cluster and namespace for dropdown menus configurable. #2893\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Include rate of label and series queries in \"Reads\" dashboard. #3065 #3074\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Fix legend showing on per-pod panels. #2944\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Use the \"req/s\" unit on panels showing the requests rate. #3118\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Use a consistent color across dashboards for the error rate. #3154\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [FEATURE] Added support for query-scheduler ring-based service discovery. #3128\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier autoscaling is now slower on scale downs: scale down 10% every 1m instead of 100%. #2962\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: `gossip_member_label` is now set for ruler-queriers. #3141\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] mimirtool analyze: Store the query errors instead of exit during the analysis. #3052\n* [BUGFIX] mimir-tool remote-read: fix returns where some conditions [return nil error even if there is error](https://github.com/grafana/cortex-tools/issues/260). #3053\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added documentation on how to configure storage retention. #2970\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved gRPC clients config documentation. #3020\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added documentation on how to manage alerting and recording rules. #2983\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved `MimirSchedulerQueriesStuck` runbook. #3006\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added \"Cluster label verification\" section to memberlist documentation. #3096\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Mention compression in multi-zone replication documentation. #3107\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed configuration option names in \"Enabling zone-awareness via the Grafana Mimir Jsonnet\". #3018\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed `mimirtool analyze` parameters documentation. #3094\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed YAML configuraton in the \"Manage the configuration of Grafana Mimir with Helm\" guide. #3042\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed Alertmanager capacity planning documentation. #3132\n\n### Tools\n\n- [BUGFIX] trafficdump: Fixed panic occurring when `-success-only=true` and the captured request failed. #2863\n\n## 2.3.1\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: query sharding took exponential time to map binary expressions. #3027\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: Stop panics on OTLP endpoint when a single metric has multiple timeseries. #3040\n\n## 2.3.0\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Added user label to ingester metric `cortex_ingester_tsdb_out_of_order_samples_appended_total`. On multitenant clusters this helps us find the rate of appended out-of-order samples for a specific tenant. #2493\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: delete source and output blocks from local disk on compaction failed, to reduce likelihood that subsequent compactions fail because of no space left on disk. #2261\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: Remove unused CLI flags `-ruler.search-pending-for` and `-ruler.flush-period` (and their respective YAML config options). #2288\n* [CHANGE] Successful gRPC requests are no longer logged (only affects internal API calls). #2309\n* [CHANGE] Add new `-*.consul.cas-retry-delay` flags. They have a default value of `1s`, while previously there was no delay between retries. #2309\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: Remove the experimental ability to run requests in a dedicated OS thread pool and associated CLI flag `-store-gateway.thread-pool-size`. #2423\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: disabled TCP-based ping fallback, because Mimir already uses a custom transport based on TCP. #2456\n* [CHANGE] Change default value for `-distributor.ha-tracker.max-clusters` to `100` to provide a DoS protection. #2465\n* [CHANGE] Experimental block upload API exposed by compactor has changed: Previous `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}` endpoint for starting block upload is now `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/start`, and previous endpoint `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}?uploadComplete=true` for finishing block upload is now `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/finish`. New API endpoint has been added: `/api/v1/upload/block/{block}/check`. #2486 #2548\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: changed `-compactor.max-compaction-time` default from `0s` (disabled) to `1h`. When compacting blocks for a tenant, the compactor will move to compact blocks of another tenant or re-plan blocks to compact at least every 1h. #2514\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: removed previously deprecated `extend_writes` (see #1856) YAML key and `-distributor.extend-writes` CLI flag from the distributor config. #2551\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: removed previously deprecated `active_series_custom_trackers` (see #1188) YAML key from the ingester config. #2552\n* [CHANGE] The tenant ID `__mimir_cluster` is reserved by Mimir and not allowed to store metrics. #2643\n* [CHANGE] Purger: removed the purger component and moved its API endpoints `/purger/delete_tenant` and `/purger/delete_tenant_status` to the compactor at `/compactor/delete_tenant` and `/compactor/delete_tenant_status`. The new endpoints on the compactor are stable. #2644\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: Change the leave timeout duration (`-memberlist.leave-timeout duration`) from 5s to 20s and connection timeout (`-memberlist.packet-dial-timeout`) from 5s to 2s. This makes leave timeout 10x the connection timeout, so that we can communicate the leave to at least 1 node, if the first 9 we try to contact times out. #2669\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: return status code `412 Precondition Failed` and log info message when alertmanager isn't configured for a tenant. #2635\n* [CHANGE] Distributor: if forwarding rules are used to forward samples, exemplars are now removed from the request. #2710 #2725\n* [CHANGE] Limits: change the default value of `max_global_series_per_metric` limit to `0` (disabled). Setting this limit by default does not provide much benefit because series are sharded by all labels. #2714\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: experimental `-blocks-storage.tsdb.new-chunk-disk-mapper` has been removed, new chunk disk mapper is now always used, and is no longer marked experimental. Default value of `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-chunks-write-queue-size` has changed to 1000000, this enables async chunk queue by default, which leads to improved latency on the write path when new chunks are created in ingesters. #2762\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: removed deprecated `-blocks-storage.tsdb.isolation-enabled` option. TSDB-level isolation is now always disabled in Mimir. #2782\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay` must either be set to 0 (to disable partial blocks deletion) or a value higher than `4h`. #2787\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: CLI flag `-query-frontend.align-querier-with-step` has been deprecated. Please use `-query-frontend.align-queries-with-step` instead. #2840\n* [FEATURE] Compactor: Adds the ability to delete partial blocks after a configurable delay. This option can be configured per tenant. #2285\n  - `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay`, as a duration string, allows you to set the delay since a partial block has been modified before marking it for deletion. A value of `0`, the default, disables this feature.\n  - The metric `cortex_compactor_blocks_marked_for_deletion_total` has a new value for the `reason` label `reason=\"partial\"`, when a block deletion marker is triggered by the partial block deletion delay.\n* [FEATURE] Querier: enabled support for queries with negative offsets, which are not cached in the query results cache. #2429\n* [FEATURE] EXPERIMENTAL: OpenTelemetry Metrics ingestion path on `/otlp/v1/metrics`. #695 #2436 #2461\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added support for tenant federation to metric metadata endpoint. #2467\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: introduced experimental support to split instant queries by time. The instant query splitting can be enabled setting `-query-frontend.split-instant-queries-by-interval`. #2469 #2564 #2565 #2570 #2571 #2572 #2573 #2574 #2575 #2576 #2581 #2582 #2601 #2632 #2633 #2634 #2641 #2642 #2766\n* [FEATURE] Introduced an experimental anonymous usage statistics tracking (disabled by default), to help Mimir maintainers make better decisions to support the open source community. The tracking system anonymously collects non-sensitive, non-personally identifiable information about the running Mimir cluster, and is disabled by default. #2643 #2662 #2685 #2732 #2733 #2735\n* [FEATURE] Introduced an experimental deployment mode called read-write and running a fully featured Mimir cluster with three components: write, read and backend. The read-write deployment mode is a trade-off between the monolithic mode (only one component, no isolation) and the microservices mode (many components, high isolation). #2754 #2838\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Decreased distributor tests execution time. #2562\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alertmanager: Allow the HTTP `proxy_url` configuration option in the receiver's configuration. #2317\n* [ENHANCEMENT] ring: optimize shuffle-shard computation when lookback is used, and all instances have registered timestamp within the lookback window. In that case we can immediately return origial ring, because we would select all instances anyway. #2309\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: added experimental memberlist cluster label support via `-memberlist.cluster-label` and `-memberlist.cluster-label-verification-disabled` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options). #2354\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Object storage can now be configured for all components using the `common` YAML config option key (or `-common.storage.*` CLI flags). #2330 #2347\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Go: updated to go 1.18.4. #2400\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway, listblocks: list of blocks now includes stats from `meta.json` file: number of series, samples and chunks. #2425\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added more buckets to `cortex_ingester_client_request_duration_seconds` histogram metric, to correctly track requests taking longer than 1s (up until 16s). #2445\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Azure client: Improve memory usage for large object storage downloads. #2408\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add `-distributor.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests-bytes`. This limit protects the distributor against multiple large requests that together may cause an OOM, but are only a few, so do not trigger the `max-inflight-push-requests` limit. #2413\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Drop exemplars in distributor for tenants where exemplars are disabled. #2504\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Runtime Config: Allow operator to specify multiple comma-separated yaml files in `-runtime-config.file` that will be merged in left to right order. #2583\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query sharding: shard binary operations only if it doesn't lead to non-shardable vector selectors in one of the operands. #2696\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add packaging for both debian based deb file and redhat based rpm file using FPM. #1803\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add `cortex_distributor_query_ingester_chunks_deduped_total` and `cortex_distributor_query_ingester_chunks_total` metrics for determining how effective ingester chunk deduplication at query time is. #2713\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgrade Docker base images to `alpine:3.16.2`. #2729\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Add `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/status/buildinfo` endpoint. #2724\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: Ensure all queries pulled from query-frontend or query-scheduler are immediately executed. The maximum workers concurrency in each querier is configured by `-querier.max-concurrent`. #2598\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add `cortex_distributor_received_requests_total` and `cortex_distributor_requests_in_total` metrics to provide visiblity into appropriate per-tenant request limits. #2770\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Add single forwarding remote-write endpoint for a tenant (`forwarding_endpoint`), instead of using per-rule endpoints. This takes precendence over per-rule endpoints. #2801\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `err-mimir-distributor-max-write-message-size` to the errors catalog. #2470\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add sanity check at startup to ensure the configured filesystem directories don't overlap for different components. #2828 #2947\n* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fixed a bug on the experimental out-of-order implementation that led to wrong query results. #2701\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: log the actual error on compaction failed. #2261\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: restore state from storage even when running a single replica. #2293\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: do not block \"List Prometheus rules\" API endpoint while syncing rules. #2289\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: return proper `*status.Status` error when running in remote operational mode. #2417\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: ensure the configured `-alertmanager.web.external-url` is either a path starting with `/`, or a full URL including the scheme and hostname. #2381 #2542\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: fix problem with loss of some packets, typically ring updates when instances were removed from the ring during shutdown. #2418\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fix misfiring `MimirIngesterHasUnshippedBlocks` and stale `cortex_ingester_oldest_unshipped_block_timestamp_seconds` when some block uploads fail. #2435\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix incorrect mapping of http status codes 429 to 500 when request queue is full. #2447\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: Fix problem with ring being empty right after startup. Memberlist KV store now tries to \"fast-join\" the cluster to avoid serving empty KV store. #2505\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: Fix bug when using `-compactor.partial-block-deletion-delay`: compactor didn't correctly check for modification time of all block files. #2559\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix wrong query sharding results for queries with boolean result like `1 < bool 0`. #2558\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed error messages related to per-instance limits incorrectly reporting they can be set on a per-tenant basis. #2610\n* [BUGFIX] Perform HA-deduplication before forwarding samples according to forwarding rules in the distributor. #2603 #2709\n* [BUGFIX] Fix reporting of tracing spans from PromQL engine. #2707\n* [BUGFIX] Apply relabel and drop_label rules before forwarding rules in the distributor. #2703\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: Register `cortex_discarded_requests_total` metric, which previously was not registered and therefore not exported. #2712\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix not restoring alerts' state at startup. #2648\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: Fix disk filling up after restarting ingesters with out-of-order support disabled while it was enabled before. #2799\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: retry joining memberlist cluster on startup when no nodes are resolved. #2837\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix incorrect mapping of http status codes 413 to 500 when request is too large. #2819\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: revert upstream alertmananger to v0.24.0 to fix panic when unmarshalling email headers #2924 #2925\n\n### Mixin\n\n* [CHANGE] Dashboards: \"Slow Queries\" dashboard no longer works with versions older than Grafana 9.0. #2223\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: use RSS memory instead of working set memory in the `MimirAllocatingTooMuchMemory` alert for ingesters. #2480\n* [CHANGE] Dashboards: remove the \"Cache - Latency (old)\" panel from the \"Mimir / Queries\" dashboard. #2796\n* [FEATURE] Dashboards: added support to experimental read-write deployment mode. #2780\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: added missed rule evaluations to the \"Evaluations per second\" panel in the \"Mimir / Ruler\" dashboard. #2314\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: add k8s resource requests to CPU and memory panels. #2346\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: add RSS memory utilization panel for ingesters, store-gateways and compactors. #2479\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: allow to configure graph tooltip. #2647\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: MimirFrontendQueriesStuck and MimirSchedulerQueriesStuck alerts are more reliable now as they consider all the intermediate samples in the minute prior to the evaluation. #2630\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: added `RolloutOperatorNotReconciling` alert, firing if the optional rollout-operator is not successfully reconciling. #2700\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: added support to query-tee in front of ruler-query-frontend in the \"Remote ruler reads\" dashboard. #2761\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Introduce support for baremetal deployment, setting `deployment_type: 'baremetal'` in the mixin `_config`. #2657\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: use timeseries panel to show exemplars. #2800\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: fixed unit of latency panels in the \"Mimir / Ruler\" dashboard. #2312\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: fixed \"Intervals per query\" panel in the \"Mimir / Queries\" dashboard. #2308\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Make \"Slow Queries\" dashboard works with Grafana 9.0. #2223\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: add missing API routes to Ruler dashboard. #2412\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: stop setting 'interval' in dashboards; it should be set on your datasource. #2802\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] query-scheduler is enabled by default. We advise to deploy the query-scheduler to improve the scalability of the query-frontend. #2431\n* [CHANGE] Replaced anti-affinity rules with pod topology spread constraints for distributor, query-frontend, querier and ruler. #2517\n  - The following configuration options have been removed:\n    - `distributor_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node`\n    - `query_frontend_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node`\n    - `querier_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node`\n    - `ruler_allow_multiple_replicas_on_same_node`\n  - The following configuration options have been added:\n    - `distributor_topology_spread_max_skew`\n    - `query_frontend_topology_spread_max_skew`\n    - `querier_topology_spread_max_skew`\n    - `ruler_topology_spread_max_skew`\n* [CHANGE] Change `max_global_series_per_metric` to 0 in all plans, and as a default value. #2669\n* [FEATURE] Memberlist: added support for experimental memberlist cluster label, through the jsonnet configuration options `memberlist_cluster_label` and `memberlist_cluster_label_verification_disabled`. #2349\n* [FEATURE] Added ruler-querier autoscaling support. It requires [KEDA](https://keda.sh) installed in the Kubernetes cluster. Ruler-querier autoscaler can be enabled and configure through the following options in the jsonnet config: #2545\n  * `autoscaling_ruler_querier_enabled`: `true` to enable autoscaling.\n  * `autoscaling_ruler_querier_min_replicas`: minimum number of ruler-querier replicas.\n  * `autoscaling_ruler_querier_max_replicas`: maximum number of ruler-querier replicas.\n  * `autoscaling_prometheus_url`: Prometheus base URL from which to scrape Mimir metrics (e.g. `http://prometheus.default:9090/prometheus`).\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist now uses DNS service-discovery by default. #2549\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgrade memcached image tag to `memcached:1.6.16-alpine`. #2740\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `$._config.configmaps` and `$._config.runtime_config_files` to make it easy to add new configmaps or runtime config file to all components. #2748\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `mimirtool backfill` command to upload Prometheus blocks using API available in the compactor. #1822\n* [ENHANCEMENT] mimirtool bucket-validation: Verify existing objects can be overwritten by subsequent uploads. #2491\n* [ENHANCEMENT] mimirtool config convert: Now supports migrating to the current version of Mimir. #2629\n* [BUGFIX] mimirtool analyze: Fix dashboard JSON unmarshalling errors by using custom parsing. #2386\n* [BUGFIX] Version checking no longer prompts for updating when already on latest version. #2723\n\n### Mimir Continuous Test\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added basic authentication and bearer token support for when Mimir is behind a gateway authenticating the calls. #2717\n\n### Query-tee\n\n* [CHANGE] Renamed CLI flag `-server.service-port` to `-server.http-service-port`. #2683\n* [CHANGE] Renamed metric `cortex_querytee_request_duration_seconds` to `cortex_querytee_backend_request_duration_seconds`. Metric `cortex_querytee_request_duration_seconds` is now reported without label `backend`. #2683\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added HTTP over gRPC support to `query-tee` to allow testing gRPC requests to Mimir instances. #2683\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Referenced `mimirtool` commands in the HTTP API documentation. #2516\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved DNS service discovery documentation. #2513\n\n### Tools\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] `markblocks` now processes multiple blocks concurrently. #2677\n\n## 2.2.0\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Increased default configuration for `-server.grpc-max-recv-msg-size-bytes` and `-server.grpc-max-send-msg-size-bytes` from 4MB to 100MB. #1884\n* [CHANGE] Default values have changed for the following settings. This improves query performance for recent data (within 12h) by only reading from ingesters: #1909 #1921\n    - `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.ignore-blocks-within` now defaults to `10h` (previously `0`)\n    - `-querier.query-store-after` now defaults to `12h` (previously `0`)\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed support for migrating local files from Cortex 1.8 or earlier. Related to original Cortex PR https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/3910. #2253\n* [CHANGE] The following settings are now classified as advanced because the defaults should work for most users and tuning them requires in-depth knowledge of how the read path works: #1929\n    - `-querier.query-ingesters-within`\n    - `-querier.query-store-after`\n* [CHANGE] Config flag category overrides can be set dynamically at runtime. #1934\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: deprecated `-ingester.ring.join-after`. Mimir now behaves as this setting is always set to 0s. This configuration option will be removed in Mimir 2.4.0. #1965\n* [CHANGE] Blocks uploaded by ingester no longer contain `__org_id__` label. Compactor now ignores this label and will compact blocks with and without this label together. `mimirconvert` tool will remove the label from blocks as \"unknown\" label. #1972\n* [CHANGE] Querier: deprecated `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period`, instead adding `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-enabled` to enable or disable shuffle sharding on the read path. The value of `-querier.query-ingesters-within` is now used internally for shuffle sharding lookback. #2110\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: `-memberlist.abort-if-join-fails` now defaults to false. Previously it defaulted to true. #2168\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: `/api/v1/rules*` and `/prometheus/rules*` configuration endpoints are removed. Use `/prometheus/config/v1/rules*`. #2182\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: `-ingester.exemplars-update-period` has been renamed to `-ingester.tsdb-config-update-period`. You can use it to update multiple, per-tenant TSDB configurations. #2187\n* [FEATURE] Ingester: (Experimental) Add the ability to ingest out-of-order samples up to an allowed limit. If you enable this feature, it requires additional memory and disk space. This feature also enables a write-behind log, which might lead to longer ingester-start replays. When this feature is disabled, there is no overhead on memory, disk space, or startup times. #2187\n  * `-ingester.out-of-order-time-window`, as duration string, allows you to set how back in time a sample can be. The default is `0s`, where `s` is seconds.\n  * `cortex_ingester_tsdb_out_of_order_samples_appended_total` metric tracks the total number of out-of-order samples ingested by the ingester.\n  * `cortex_discarded_samples_total` has a new label `reason=\"sample-too-old\"`, when the `-ingester.out-of-order-time-window` flag is greater than zero. The label tracks the number of samples that were discarded for being too old; they were out of order, but beyond the time window allowed. The labels `reason=\"sample-out-of-order\"` and `reason=\"sample-out-of-bounds\"` are not used when out-of-order ingestion is enabled.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: Added limit to prevent tenants from sending excessive number of requests: #1843\n  * The following CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) have been added:\n    * `-distributor.request-rate-limit`\n    * `-distributor.request-burst-limit`\n  * The following metric is exposed to tell how many requests have been rejected:\n    * `cortex_discarded_requests_total`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Add the experimental ability to run requests in a dedicated OS thread pool. This feature can be configured using `-store-gateway.thread-pool-size` and is disabled by default. Replaces the ability to run index header operations in a dedicated thread pool. #1660 #1812\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved error messages to make them easier to understand; each now have a unique, global identifier that you can use to look up in the runbooks for more information. #1907 #1919 #1888 #1939 #1984 #2009 #2056 #2066 #2104 #2150 #2234\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist KV: incoming messages are now processed on per-key goroutine. This may reduce loss of \"maintanance\" packets in busy memberlist installations, but use more CPU. New `memberlist_client_received_broadcasts_dropped_total` counter tracks number of dropped per-key messages. #1912\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Blocks Storage, Alertmanager, Ruler: add support a prefix to the bucket store (`*_storage.storage_prefix`). This enables using the same bucket for the three components. #1686 #1951\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgrade Docker base images to `alpine:3.16.0`. #2028\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Add experimental configuration option for the store-gateway to attempt to pre-populate the file system cache when memory-mapping index-header files. Enabled with `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.index-header.map-populate-enabled=true`. Note this flag only has an effect when running on Linux. #2019 #2054\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Chunk Mapper: reduce memory usage of async chunk mapper. #2043\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce sleep time when reading WAL. #2098\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Run sanity check on blocks storage configuration at startup. #2144\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Add HTTP API for uploading TSDB blocks.

You can re-enable it setting `gateway_enabled: true` in the mixin config and recompiling the mixin running `make build-mixin`. #1955\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: adapt `MimirFrontendQueriesStuck` and `MimirSchedulerQueriesStuck` to consider ruler query path components. #1949\n* [CHANGE] Alerts: Change `MimirRulerTooManyFailedQueries` severity to `critical`. #2165\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Add config option `datasource_regex` to customise the regular expression used to select valid datasources for Mimir dashboards. #1802\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Added \"Mimir / Remote ruler reads\" and \"Mimir / Remote ruler reads resources\" dashboards. #1911 #1937\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Dashboards: Make networking panels work for pods created by the mimir-distributed helm chart. #1927\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Alerts: Add `MimirStoreGatewayNoSyncedTenants` alert that fires when there is a store-gateway owning no tenants. #1882\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Make `recording_rules_range_interval` configurable for cases where Mimir metrics are scraped less often that every 30 seconds. #2118\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added minimum Grafana version to mixin dashboards. #1943\n* [BUGFIX] Fix `container_memory_usage_bytes:sum` recording rule. #1865\n* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirGossipMembersMismatch` alerts if Mimir alertmanager is activated. #1870\n* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirRulerMissedEvaluations` to show % of missed alerts as a value between 0 and 100 instead of 0 and 1. #1895\n* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirCompactorHasNotUploadedBlocks` alert false positive when Mimir is deployed in monolithic mode. #1902\n* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirGossipMembersMismatch` to make it less sensitive during rollouts and fire one alert per installation, not per job. #1926\n* [BUGFIX] Do not trigger `MimirAllocatingTooMuchMemory` alerts if no container limits are supplied. #1905\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Remove empty \"Chunks per query\" panel from `Mimir / Queries` dashboard. #1928\n* [BUGFIX] Dashboards: Use Grafana's `$__rate_interval` for rate queries in dashboards to support scrape intervals of >15s. #2011\n* [BUGFIX] Alerts: Make each version of `MimirCompactorHasNotUploadedBlocks` distinct to avoid rule evaluation failures due to duplicate series being generated. #2197\n* [BUGFIX] Fix `MimirGossipMembersMismatch` alert when using remote ruler evaluation. #2159\n\n### Jsonnet\n\n* [CHANGE] Remove use of `-querier.query-store-after`, `-querier.shuffle-sharding-ingesters-lookback-period`, `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.ignore-blocks-within`, and `-blocks-storage.tsdb.close-idle-tsdb-timeout` CLI flags since the values now match defaults. #1915 #1921\n* [CHANGE] Change default value for `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.memcached.timeout` to `450ms` to increase use of cached data. #2035\n* [CHANGE] The `memberlist_ring_enabled` configuration now applies to Alertmanager. #2102 #2103 #2107\n* [CHANGE] Default value for `memberlist_ring_enabled` is now true. It means that all hash rings use Memberlist as default KV store instead of Consul (previous default). #2161\n* [CHANGE] Configure `-ingester.max-global-metadata-per-user` to correspond to 20% of the configured max number of series per tenant. #2250\n* [CHANGE] Configure `-ingester.max-global-metadata-per-metric` to be 10. #2250\n* [CHANGE] Change `_config.multi_zone_ingester_max_unavailable` to 25. #2251\n* [FEATURE] Added querier autoscaling support. It requires [KEDA](https://keda.sh) installed in the Kubernetes cluster and query-scheduler enabled in the Mimir cluster. Querier autoscaler can be enabled and configure through the following options in the jsonnet config: #2013 #2023\n  * `autoscaling_querier_enabled`: `true` to enable autoscaling.\n  * `autoscaling_querier_min_replicas`: minimum number of querier replicas.\n  * `autoscaling_querier_max_replicas`: maximum number of querier replicas.\n  * `autoscaling_prometheus_url`: Prometheus base URL from which to scrape Mimir metrics (e.g. `http://prometheus.default:9090/prometheus`).\n* [FEATURE] Jsonnet: Add support for ruler remote evaluation mode (`ruler_remote_evaluation_enabled`), which deploys and uses a dedicated query path for rule evaluation. This enables the benefits of the query-frontend for rule evaluation, such as query sharding. #2073\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `compactor` service, that can be used to route requests directly to compactor (e.g. admin UI). #2063\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added a `consul_enabled` configuration option to provide the ability to disable consul. It is automatically set to false when `memberlist_ring_enabled` is true and `multikv_migration_enabled` (used for migration from Consul to memberlist) is not set. #2093 #2152\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: Fix disabling shuffle sharding on the read path whilst keeping it enabled on write path. #2164\n\n### Mimirtool\n\n* [CHANGE] mimirtool rules: `--use-legacy-routes` now toggles between using `/prometheus/config/v1/rules` (default) and `/api/v1/rules` (legacy) endpoints. #2182\n* [FEATURE] Added bearer token support for when Mimir is behind a gateway authenticating by bearer token. #2146\n* [BUGFIX] mimirtool analyze: Fix dashboard JSON unmarshalling errors (#1840). #1973\n* [BUGFIX] Make mimirtool build for Windows work again. #2273\n\n### Mimir Continuous Test\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added the `-tests.smoke-test` flag to run the `mimir-continuous-test` suite once and immediately exit. #2047 #2094\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added the `-tests.write-protocol` flag to write using the `prometheus` remote write protocol or `otlp-http` in the `mimir-continuous-test` suite. #5719\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Published Grafana Mimir runbooks as part of documentation. #1970\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved ruler's \"remote operational mode\" documentation. #1906\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Recommend fast disks for ingesters and store-gateways in production tips. #1903\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Explain the runtime override of active series matchers. #1868\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Clarify \"Set rule group\" API specification. #1869\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Published Mimir jsonnet documentation. #2024\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Documented required scrape interval for using alerting and recording rules from Mimir jsonnet. #2147\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Runbooks: Mention memberlist as possible source of problems for various alerts. #2158\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added step-by-step article about migrating from Consul to Memberlist KV store using jsonnet without downtime. #2166\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Documented `/memberlist` admin page. #2166\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Documented how to configure Grafana Mimir's ruler with Jsonnet. #2127\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Documented how to configure queriers’ autoscaling with Jsonnet. #2128\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated mixin building instructions in \"Installing Grafana Mimir dashboards and alerts\" article. #2015 #2163\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Fix location of \"Monitoring Grafana Mimir\" article in the documentation hierarchy. #2130\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Runbook for `MimirRequestLatency` was expanded with more practical advice. #1967\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed ruler configuration used in the getting started guide. #2052\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed Mimir Alertmanager datasource in Grafana used by \"Play with Grafana Mimir\" tutorial. #2115\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed typos in \"Scaling out Grafana Mimir\" article. #2170\n* [BUGFIX] Added missing ring endpoint exposed by Ingesters. #1918\n\n## 2.1.0\n\n### Grafana Mimir\n\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: No longer upload debug meta files to object storage. #1257\n* [CHANGE] Default values have changed for the following settings: #1547\n    - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-max-recv-msg-size` now defaults to 100 MiB (previously was not configurable and set to 16 MiB)\n    - `-alertmanager.alertmanager-client.grpc-max-send-msg-size` now defaults to 100 MiB (previously was not configurable and set to 4 MiB)\n    - `-alertmanager.max-recv-msg-size` now defaults to 100 MiB (previously was 16 MiB)\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Add `user` label to metrics `cortex_ingester_ingested_samples_total` and `cortex_ingester_ingested_samples_failures_total`. #1533\n* [CHANGE] Ingester: Changed `-blocks-storage.tsdb.isolation-enabled` default from `true` to `false`. The config option has also been deprecated and will be removed in 2 minor version. #1655\n* [CHANGE] Query-frontend: results cache keys are now versioned, this will cause cache to be re-filled when rolling out this version. #1631\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: enabled attributes in-memory cache by default. New default configuration is `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.attributes-in-memory-max-items=50000`. #1727\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: Removed the metric `cortex_compactor_garbage_collected_blocks_total` since it duplicates `cortex_compactor_blocks_marked_for_deletion_total`. #1728\n* [CHANGE] All: Logs that used the`org_id` label now use `user` label. #1634 #1758\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: the following metrics are not exported for a given `user` and `integration` when the metric value is zero: #1783\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_notifications_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_notifications_failed_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_notification_requests_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_notification_requests_failed_total`\n  * `cortex_alertmanager_notification_rate_limited_total`\n* [CHANGE] Removed the following metrics exposed by the Mimir hash rings: #1791\n  * `cortex_member_ring_tokens_owned`\n  * `cortex_member_ring_tokens_to_own`\n  * `cortex_ring_tokens_owned`\n  * `cortex_ring_member_ownership_percent`\n* [CHANGE] Querier / Ruler: removed the following metrics tracking number of query requests send to each ingester.

[CHANGE] Shuffle-sharding:\n  * `-distributor.sharding-strategy` option has been removed, and shuffle sharding is enabled by default. Default shard size is set to 0, which disables shuffle sharding for the tenant (all ingesters will receive tenants's samples). #888\n  * `-ruler.sharding-strategy` option has been removed from ruler. Ruler now uses shuffle-sharding by default, but respects `ruler_tenant_shard_size`, which defaults to 0 (ie. use all rulers for tenant). #889\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-strategy` option has been removed store-gateways.

The default configuration must now run the compactor in order to write the bucket index or else queries to long term storage will fail. #924\n* [CHANGE] Option `-auth.enabled` has been renamed to `-auth.multitenancy-enabled`. #1130\n* [CHANGE] Default tenant ID used with disabled auth (`-auth.multitenancy-enabled=false`) has changed from `fake` to `anonymous`. This tenant ID can now be changed with `-auth.no-auth-tenant` option. #1063\n* [CHANGE] The default values for the following local directories have changed: #1072\n  * `-alertmanager.storage.path` default value changed to `./data-alertmanager/`\n  * `-compactor.data-dir` default value changed to `./data-compactor/`\n  * `-ruler.rule-path` default value changed to `./data-ruler/`\n* [CHANGE] The default value for gRPC max send message size has been changed from 16MB to 100MB. This affects the following parameters: #1152\n  * `-query-frontend.grpc-client-config.grpc-max-send-msg-size`\n  * `-ingester.client.grpc-max-send-msg-size`\n  * `-querier.frontend-client.grpc-max-send-msg-size`\n  * `-query-scheduler.grpc-client-config.grpc-max-send-msg-size`\n  * `-ruler.client.grpc-max-send-msg-size`\n* [CHANGE] Remove `-http.prefix` flag (and `http_prefix` config file option). #763\n* [CHANGE] Remove legacy endpoints. Please use their alternatives listed below. As part of the removal process we are\n  introducing two new sets of endpoints for the ruler configuration API: `<prometheus-http-prefix>/rules` and\n  `<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/v1/rules/**`.

[#4260](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4260)\n* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: Option `-querier.ingester-streaming` has been removed. Querier/ruler now always use streaming method to query ingesters. #204\n* [CHANGE] Querier: always fetch labels from store and respect start/end times in request; the option `-querier.query-store-for-labels-enabled` has been removed and is now always on. #518 #1132\n* [CHANGE] Querier / ruler: removed the `-store.query-chunk-limit` flag (and its respective YAML config option `max_chunks_per_query`). `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query` (and its respective YAML config option `max_fetched_chunks_per_query`) should be used instead. #705\n* [CHANGE] Querier/Ruler: `-querier.active-query-tracker-dir` option has been removed. Active query tracking is now done via Activity tracker configured by `-activity-tracker.filepath` and enabled by default. Limit for max number of concurrent queries (`-querier.max-concurrent`) is now respected even if activity tracking is not enabled. #661 #822\n* [CHANGE] Querier/ruler/query-frontend: the experimental `-querier.at-modifier-enabled` CLI flag has been removed and the PromQL `@` modifier is always enabled. #941\n* [CHANGE] Querier: removed `-querier.worker-match-max-concurrent` and `-querier.worker-parallelism` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options). Mimir now behaves like if `-querier.worker-match-max-concurrent` is always enabled and you should configure the max concurrency per querier process using `-querier.max-concurrent` instead. #958\n* [CHANGE] Querier: changed default value of `-querier.query-ingesters-within` from `0` to `13h`. #967\n* [CHANGE] Querier: rename metric `cortex_query_fetched_chunks_bytes_total` to `cortex_query_fetched_chunk_bytes_total` to be consistent with the limit name. #476\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: add two new metrics `cortex_ruler_list_rules_seconds` and `cortex_ruler_load_rule_groups_seconds` to the ruler. #906\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: endpoints for listing configured rules now return HTTP status code 200 and an empty map when there are no rules instead of an HTTP 404 and plain text error message. The following endpoints are affected: #456\n  * `<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/v1/rules`\n  * `<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/v1/rules/{namespace}`\n  * `<prometheus-http-prefix>/rules` (deprecated)\n  * `<prometheus-http-prefix>/rules/{namespace}` (deprecated)\n  * `/api/v1/rules` (deprecated)\n  * `/api/v1/rules/{namespace}` (deprecated)\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: removed `configdb` support from Ruler backend storages. #15 #38 #819\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: removed the support for the deprecated storage configuration via `-ruler.storage.*` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options). Use `-ruler-storage.*` instead. #628\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: set new default limits for rule groups: `-ruler.max-rules-per-rule-group` to 20 (previously 0, disabled) and `-ruler.max-rule-groups-per-tenant` to 70 (previously 0, disabled). #847\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: removed `-ruler.enable-sharding` option, and changed default value of `-ruler.ring.store` to `memberlist`. #943\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: `-ruler.alertmanager-use-v2` has been removed. The ruler will always use the `v2` endpoints. #954 #1100\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: `-experimental.ruler.enable-api` flag has been renamed to `-ruler.enable-api` and is now stable. The default value has also changed from `false` to `true`, so both ruler and alertmanager API are enabled by default. #913 #1065\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: add support for [DNS service discovery format](./docs/sources/configuration/arguments.md#dns-service-discovery) for `-ruler.alertmanager-url`. `-ruler.alertmanager-discovery` flag has been removed. URLs following the prior SRV format, will be treated as a static target. To continue using service discovery for these URLs prepend `dnssrvnoa+` to them. #993\n  * The following metrics for Alertmanager DNS service discovery are replaced:\n    * `prometheus_sd_dns_lookups_total` replaced by `cortex_dns_lookups_total{component=\"ruler\"}`\n    * `prometheus_sd_dns_lookup_failures_total` replaced by `cortex_dns_failures_total{component=\"ruler\"}`\n* [CHANGE] Ruler: deprecate `/api/v1/rules/**` and `<prometheus-http-prefix/rules/**` configuration API endpoints in favour of `/<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/v1/rules/**`. Deprecated endpoints will be removed in Mimir 2.2.0. Main configuration API endpoints are now `/<prometheus-http-prefix>/config/api/v1/rules/**` introduced in Mimir 2.0.0. #1222\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: index cache now includes tenant in cache keys, this invalidates previous cached entries. #607\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: increased memcached index caching TTL from 1 day to 7 days. #718\n* [CHANGE] Store-gateway: options `-store-gateway.sharding-enabled` and `-querier.store-gateway-addresses` were removed. Default value of `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.store` is now `memberlist` and default value for `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.wait-stability-min-duration` changed from `1m` to `0` (disabled). #976\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: compactor will no longer try to compact blocks that are already marked for deletion. Previously compactor would consider blocks marked for deletion within `-compactor.deletion-delay / 2` period as eligible for compaction. [#4328](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4328)\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: Removed support for block deletion marks migration. If you're upgrading from Cortex < 1.7.0 to Mimir, you should upgrade the compactor to Cortex >= 1.7.0 first, run it at least once and then upgrade to Mimir. #122\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: removed the `cortex_compactor_group_vertical_compactions_total` metric. #278\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: no longer waits for initial blocks cleanup to finish before starting compactions. #282\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: removed overlapping sources detection. Overlapping sources may exist due to edge cases (timing issues) when horizontally sharding compactor, but are correctly handled by compactor. #494\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: compactor now uses deletion marks from `<tenant>/markers` location in the bucket. Marker files are no longer fetched, only listed. #550\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: Default value of `-compactor.block-sync-concurrency` has changed from 20 to 8. This flag is now only used to control number of goroutines for downloading and uploading blocks during compaction. #552\n* [CHANGE] Compactor is now included in `all` target (single-binary). #866\n* [CHANGE] Compactor: Removed `-compactor.sharding-enabled` option. Sharding in compactor is now always enabled. Default value of `-compactor.ring.store` has changed from `consul` to `memberlist`. Default value of `-compactor.ring.wait-stability-min-duration` is now 0, which disables the feature. #956\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed `-alertmanager.configs.auto-webhook-root` #977\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed `configdb` support from Alertmanager backend storages. #15 #38 #819\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: Don't count user-not-found errors from replicas as failures in the `cortex_alertmanager_state_fetch_replica_state_failed_total` metric. #190\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: Use distributor for non-API routes. #213\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: removed `-alertmanager.storage.*` configuration options, with the exception of the CLI flags `-alertmanager.storage.path` and `-alertmanager.storage.retention`. Use `-alertmanager-storage.*` instead. #632\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: set default value for `-alertmanager.web.external-url=http://localhost:8080/alertmanager` to match the default configuration. #808 #1067\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api` flag has been renamed to `-alertmanager.enable-api` and is now stable. #913\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: now always runs with sharding enabled; other modes of operation are removed. #1044 #1126\n  * The following configuration options are removed:\n    * `-alertmanager.sharding-enabled`\n    * `-alertmanager.cluster.advertise-address`\n    * `-alertmanager.cluster.gossip-interval`\n    * `-alertmanager.cluster.listen-address`\n    * `-alertmanager.cluster.peers`\n    * `-alertmanager.cluster.push-pull-interval`\n  * The following configuration options are renamed:\n    * `-alertmanager.cluster.peer-timeout` to `-alertmanager.peer-timeout`\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager: the default value of `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.store` is now `memberlist`. #1171\n* [CHANGE] Ring: changed default value of `-distributor.ring.store` (Distributor ring) and `-ring.store` (Ingester ring) to `memberlist`. #1046\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: the `memberlist_kv_store_value_bytes` metric has been removed due to values no longer being stored in-memory as encoded bytes. [#4345](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4345)\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: forward only changes, not entire original message. [#4419](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4419)\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: don't accept old tombstones as incoming change, and don't forward such messages to other gossip members. [#4420](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4420)\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: changed probe interval from `1s` to `5s` and probe timeout from `500ms` to `2s`. #563\n* [CHANGE] Memberlist: the `name` label on metrics `cortex_dns_failures_total`, `cortex_dns_lookups_total` and `cortex_dns_provider_results` was renamed to `component`. #993\n* [CHANGE] Limits: removed deprecated limits for rejecting old samples #799\n  This removes the following flags:\n  * `-validation.reject-old-samples`\n  * `-validation.reject-old-samples.max-age`\n* [CHANGE] Limits: removed local limit-related flags in favor of global limits. #725\n  The distributor ring is now required, and can be configured via the `distributor.ring.*` flags.\n  This removes the following flags:\n  * `-distributor.ingestion-rate-strategy` -> will now always use the \"global\" strategy\n  * `-ingester.max-series-per-user` -> set `-ingester.max-global-series-per-user` to `N` times the existing value of `-ingester.max-series-per-user` instead\n  * `-ingester.max-series-per-metric` -> set `-ingester.max-global-series-per-metric`  to `N` times the existing value of `-ingester.max-series-per-metric` instead\n  * `-ingester.max-metadata-per-user` -> set `-ingester.max-global-metadata-per-user` to `N` times the existing value of `-ingester.max-metadata-per-user` instead\n  * `-ingester.max-metadata-per-metric` -> set `-ingester.max-global-metadata-per-metric` to `N` times the existing value of `-ingester.max-metadata-per-metric` instead\n  * In the above notes, `N` refers to the number of ingester replicas\n  Additionally, default values for the following flags have changed:\n  * `-ingester.max-global-series-per-user` from `0` to `150000`\n  * `-ingester.max-global-series-per-metric` from `0` to `20000`\n  * `-distributor.ingestion-rate-limit` from `25000` to `10000`\n  * `-distributor.ingestion-burst-size` from `50000` to `200000`\n* [CHANGE] Limits: removed limit `enforce_metric_name`, now behave as if set to `true` always. #686\n* [CHANGE] Limits: Option `-ingester.max-samples-per-query` and its YAML field `max_samples_per_query` have been removed. It required `-querier.ingester-streaming` option to be set to false, but since `-querier.ingester-streaming` is removed (always defaulting to true), the limit using it was removed as well. #204 #1132\n* [CHANGE] Limits: Set the default max number of inflight ingester push requests (`-ingester.instance-limits.max-inflight-push-requests`) to 30000 in order to prevent clusters from being overwhelmed by request volume or temporary slow-downs. #259\n* [CHANGE] Overrides exporter: renamed metric `cortex_overrides` to `cortex_limits_overrides`. #173 #407\n* [FEATURE] The following features have been moved from experimental to stable: #913 #1002\n  * Alertmanager config API\n  * Alertmanager receiver firewall\n  * Alertmanager sharding\n  * Azure blob storage support\n  * Blocks storage bucket index\n  * Disable the ring health check in the readiness endpoint (`-ingester.readiness-check-ring-health=false`)\n  * Distributor: do not extend writes on unhealthy ingesters\n  * Do not unregister ingesters from ring on shutdown (`-ingester.unregister-on-shutdown=false`)\n  * HA Tracker: cleanup of old replicas from KV Store\n  * Instance limits in ingester and distributor\n  * OpenStack Swift storage support\n  * Query-frontend: query stats tracking\n  * Query-scheduler\n  * Querier: tenant federation\n  * Ruler config API\n  * S3 Server Side Encryption (SSE) using KMS\n  * TLS configuration for gRPC, HTTP and etcd clients\n  * Zone-aware replication\n  * `/labels` API using matchers\n  * The following querier limits:\n    * `-querier.max-fetched-chunks-per-query`\n    * `-querier.max-fetched-chunk-bytes-per-query`\n    * `-querier.max-fetched-series-per-query`\n  * The following alertmanager limits:\n    * Notification rate (`-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit` and `-alertmanager.notification-rate-limit-per-integration`)\n    * Dispatcher groups (`-alertmanager.max-dispatcher-aggregation-groups`)\n    * User config size (`-alertmanager.max-config-size-bytes`)\n    * Templates count in user config (`-alertmanager.max-templates-count`)\n    * Max template size (`-alertmanager.max-template-size-bytes`)\n* [FEATURE] The endpoints `/api/v1/status/buildinfo`, `<prometheus-http-prefix>/api/v1/status/buildinfo`, and `<alertmanager-http-prefix>/api/v1/status/buildinfo` have been added to display build information and enabled features. #1219 #1240\n* [FEATURE] PromQL: added `present_over_time` support. #139\n* [FEATURE] Added \"Activity tracker\" feature which can log ongoing activities from previous Mimir run in case of a crash. It is enabled by default and controlled by the `-activity-tracker.filepath` flag. It can be disabled by setting this path to an empty string. Currently, the Store-gateway, Ruler, Querier, Query-frontend and Ingester components use this feature to track queries. #631 #782 #822 #1121\n* [FEATURE] Divide configuration parameters into categories \"basic\", \"advanced\", and \"experimental\". Only flags in the basic category are shown when invoking `-help`, whereas `-help-all` will include flags in all categories (basic, advanced, experimental). #840\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added support for tenant federation to exemplar endpoints. #927\n* [FEATURE] Ingester: can expose metrics on active series matching custom trackers configured via `-ingester.active-series-custom-trackers` (or its respective YAML config option). When configured, active series for custom trackers are exposed by the `cortex_ingester_active_series_custom_tracker` metric. #42 #672\n* [FEATURE] Ingester: Enable snapshotting of in-memory TSDB on disk during shutdown via `-blocks-storage.tsdb.memory-snapshot-on-shutdown` (experimental). #249\n* [FEATURE] Ingester: Added `-blocks-storage.tsdb.isolation-enabled` flag, which allows disabling TSDB isolation feature. This is enabled by default (per TSDB default), but disabling can improve performance of write requests. #512\n* [FEATURE] Ingester: Added `-blocks-storage.tsdb.head-chunks-write-queue-size` flag, which allows setting the size of the queue used by the TSDB before m-mapping chunks (experimental). #591\n  * Added `cortex_ingester_tsdb_mmap_chunk_write_queue_operations_total` metric to track different operations of this queue.\n* [FEATURE] Distributor: Added `-api.skip-label-name-validation-header-enabled` option to allow skipping label name validation on the HTTP write path based on `X-Mimir-SkipLabelNameValidation` header being `true` or not. #390\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: Add `cortex_query_fetched_series_total` and `cortex_query_fetched_chunks_bytes_total` per-user counters to expose the number of series and bytes fetched as part of queries. These metrics can be enabled with the `-frontend.query-stats-enabled` flag (or its respective YAML config option `query_stats_enabled`). [#4343](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4343)\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: Add `cortex_query_fetched_chunks_total` per-user counter to expose the number of chunks fetched as part of queries. This metric can be enabled with the `-query-frontend.query-stats-enabled` flag (or its respective YAML config option `query_stats_enabled`). #31\n* [FEATURE] Query-frontend: Add query sharding for instant and range queries. You can enable querysharding by setting `-query-frontend.parallelize-shardable-queries` to `true`. The following additional config and exported metrics have been added. #79 #80 #100 #124 #140 #148 #150 #151 #153 #154 #155 #156 #157 #158 #159 #160 #163 #169 #172 #196 #205 #225 #226 #227 #228 #230 #235 #240 #239 #246 #244 #319 #330 #371 #385 #400 #458 #586 #630 #660 #707 #1542\n  * New config options:\n    * `-query-frontend.query-sharding-total-shards`: The amount of shards to use when doing parallelisation via query sharding.\n    * `-query-frontend.query-sharding-max-sharded-queries`: The max number of sharded queries that can be run for a given received query. 0 to disable limit.\n    * `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.series-hash-cache-max-size-bytes`: Max size - in bytes - of the in-memory series hash cache in the store-gateway.\n    * `-blocks-storage.tsdb.series-hash-cache-max-size-bytes`: Max size - in bytes - of the in-memory series hash cache in the ingester.\n  * New exported metrics:\n    * `cortex_bucket_store_series_hash_cache_requests_total`\n    * `cortex_bucket_store_series_hash_cache_hits_total`\n    * `cortex_frontend_query_sharding_rewrites_succeeded_total`\n    * `cortex_frontend_sharded_queries_per_query`\n  * Renamed metrics:\n    * `cortex_frontend_mapped_asts_total` to `cortex_frontend_query_sharding_rewrites_attempted_total`\n  * Modified metrics:\n    * added `sharded` label to `cortex_query_seconds_total`\n  * When query sharding is enabled, the following querier config must be set on query-frontend too:\n    * `-querier.max-concurrent`\n    * `-querier.timeout`\n    * `-querier.max-samples`\n    * `-querier.at-modifier-enabled`\n    * `-querier.default-evaluation-interval`\n    * `-querier.active-query-tracker-dir`\n    * `-querier.lookback-delta`\n  * Sharding can be dynamically controlled per request using the `Sharding-Control: 64` header. (0 to disable)\n  * Sharding can be dynamically controlled per tenant using the limit `query_sharding_total_shards`. (0 to disable)\n  * Added `sharded_queries` count to the \"query stats\" log.\n  * The number of shards is adjusted to be compatible with number of compactor shards that are used by a split-and-merge compactor. The querier can use this to avoid querying blocks that cannot have series in a given query shard.\n* [FEATURE] Query-Frontend: Added `-query-frontend.cache-unaligned-requests` option to cache responses for requests that do not have step-aligned start and end times. This can improve speed of repeated queries, but can also pollute cache with results that are never reused. #432\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added label names cardinality endpoint `<prefix>/api/v1/cardinality/label_names` that is disabled by default. Can be enabled/disabled via the CLI flag `-querier.cardinality-analysis-enabled` or its respective YAML config option. Configurable on a per-tenant basis. #301 #377 #474\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added label values cardinality endpoint `<prefix>/api/v1/cardinality/label_values` that is disabled by default. Can be enabled/disabled via the CLI flag `-querier.cardinality-analysis-enabled` or its respective YAML config option, and configurable on a per-tenant basis. The maximum number of label names allowed to be queried in a single API call can be controlled via `-querier.label-values-max-cardinality-label-names-per-request`. #332 #395 #474\n* [FEATURE] Querier: Added `-store.max-labels-query-length` to restrict the range of `/series`, label-names and label-values requests. #507\n* [FEATURE] Ruler: Add new `-ruler.query-stats-enabled` which when enabled will report the `cortex_ruler_query_seconds_total` as a per-user metric that tracks the sum of the wall time of executing queries in the ruler in seconds. [#4317](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4317)\n* [FEATURE] Ruler: Added federated rule groups. #533\n  * Added `-ruler.tenant-federation.enabled` config flag.\n  * Added support for `source_tenants` field on rule groups.\n* [FEATURE] Store-gateway: Added `/store-gateway/tenants` and `/store-gateway/tenant/{tenant}/blocks` endpoints that provide functionality that was provided by `tools/listblocks`. #911 #973\n* [FEATURE] Compactor: compactor now uses new algorithm that we call \"split-and-merge\". Previous compaction strategy was removed. With the `split-and-merge` compactor source blocks for a given tenant are grouped into `-compactor.split-groups` number of groups. Each group of blocks is then compacted separately, and is split into `-compactor.split-and-merge-shards` shards (configurable on a per-tenant basis). Compaction of each tenant shards can be horizontally scaled. Number of compactors that work on jobs for single tenant can be limited by using `-compactor.compactor-tenant-shard-size` parameter, or per-tenant `compactor_tenant_shard_size` override.  #275 #281 #282 #283 #288 #290 #303 #307 #317 #323 #324 #328 #353 #368 #479 #820\n* [FEATURE] Compactor: Added `-compactor.max-compaction-time` to control how long can compaction for a single tenant take. If compactions for a tenant take longer, no new compactions are started in the same compaction cycle. Running compactions are not stopped however, and may take much longer. #523\n* [FEATURE] Compactor: When compactor finds blocks with out-of-order chunks, it will mark them for no-compaction. Blocks marked for no-compaction are ignored in future compactions too. Added metric `cortex_compactor_blocks_marked_for_no_compaction_total` to track number of blocks marked for no-compaction. Added `CortexCompactorSkippedBlocksWithOutOfOrderChunks` alert based on new metric. Markers are only checked from `<tenant>/markers` location, but uploaded to the block directory too. #520 #535 #550\n* [FEATURE] Compactor: multiple blocks are now downloaded and uploaded at once, which can shorten compaction process. #552\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Exemplars are now emitted for all gRPC calls and many operations tracked by histograms. #180\n* [ENHANCEMENT] New options `-server.http-listen-network` and `-server.grpc-listen-network` allow binding as 'tcp4' or 'tcp6'. #180\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query federation: improve performance in MergeQueryable by memoizing labels. #312\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add histogram metrics `cortex_distributor_sample_delay_seconds` and `cortex_ingester_tsdb_sample_out_of_order_delta_seconds` #488\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Check internal directory access before starting up. #1217\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Azure client: expose option to configure MSI URL and user-assigned identity. #584\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added a new metric `mimir_build_info` to coincide with `cortex_build_info`. The metric `cortex_build_info` has not been removed. #1022\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Mimir runs a sanity check of storage config at startup and will fail to start if the sanity check doesn't pass. This is done to find potential config issues before starting up. #1180\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Validate alertmanager and ruler storage configurations to ensure they don't use same bucket name and region values as those configured for the blocks storage. #1214\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: added option `-ingester.readiness-check-ring-health` to disable the ring health check in the readiness endpoint. When disabled, the health checks are run against only the ingester itself instead of all ingesters in the ring. #48 #126\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce CPU and memory utilization if remote write requests contains a large amount of \"out of bounds\" samples. #413\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: reduce CPU and memory utilization when querying chunks from ingesters. #430\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ingester: Expose ingester ring page on ingesters. #654\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: added option `-distributor.excluded-zones` to exclude ingesters running in specific zones both on write and read path. #51\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: add tags to tracing span for distributor push with user, cluster and replica. #210\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: performance optimisations. #212 #217 #242\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: reduce latency when HA-Tracking by doing KVStore updates in the background. #271\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: make distributor inflight push requests count include background calls to ingester. #398\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: silently drop exemplars more than 5 minutes older than samples in the same batch. #544\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Distributor: reject exemplars with blank label names or values. The `cortex_discarded_exemplars_total` metric will use the `exemplar_labels_blank` reason in this case. #873\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: added `cortex_query_frontend_workers_enqueued_requests_total` metric to track the number of requests enqueued in each query-scheduler. #384\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-frontend: added `cortex_query_frontend_non_step_aligned_queries_total` to track the total number of range queries with start/end not aligned to step. #347 #357 #582\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Query-scheduler: exported summary `cortex_query_scheduler_inflight_requests` tracking total number of inflight requests (both enqueued and processing) in percentile buckets. #675\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: can use the `LabelNames` call with matchers, if matchers are provided in the `/labels` API call, instead of using the more expensive `MetricsForLabelMatchers` call as before. #3 #1186\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier / store-gateway: optimized regex matchers. #319 #334 #355\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: when fetching data for specific query-shard, we can ignore some blocks based on compactor-shard ID, since sharding of series by query sharding and compactor is the same. Added metrics: #438 #450\n  * `cortex_querier_blocks_found_total`\n  * `cortex_querier_blocks_queried_total`\n  * `cortex_querier_blocks_with_compactor_shard_but_incompatible_query_shard_total`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier / ruler: reduce cpu usage, latency and peak memory consumption. #459 #463 #589\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: labels requests now obey `-querier.query-ingesters-within`, making them a little more efficient. #518\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier: retry store-gateway in case of unexpected failure, instead of failing the query. #1003\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Querier / ruler: reduce memory used by streaming queries, particularly in ruler. [#4341](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4341)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: Using shuffle sharding subring on GetRules API. [#4466](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4466)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ruler: wait for ruler ring client to self-detect during startup. #990\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added `cortex_bucket_store_sent_chunk_size_bytes` metric, tracking the size of chunks sent from store-gateway to querier. #123\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: reduced CPU and memory utilization due to exported metrics aggregation for instances with a large number of tenants. #123 #142\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: added an in-memory LRU cache for chunks attributes. Can be enabled setting `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.chunks-cache.attributes-in-memory-max-items=X` where `X` is the max number of items to keep in the in-memory cache. The following new metrics are exposed: #279 #415 #437\n  * `cortex_cache_memory_requests_total`\n  * `cortex_cache_memory_hits_total`\n  * `cortex_cache_memory_items_count`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: log index cache requests to tracing spans. #419\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: store-gateway can now ignore blocks with minimum time within `-blocks-storage.bucket-store.ignore-blocks-within` duration. Useful when used together with `-querier.query-store-after`. #502\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: label values with matchers now doesn't preload or list series, reducing latency and memory consumption. #534\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: the results of `LabelNames()`, `LabelValues()` and `Series(skipChunks=true)` calls are now cached in the index cache. #590\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: Added `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.unregister-on-shutdown` option that allows store-gateway to stay in the ring even after shutdown. Defaults to `true`, which is the same as current behaviour. #610 #614\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Store-gateway: wait for ring tokens stability instead of ring stability to speed up startup and tests. #620\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: add timeout for waiting on compactor to become ACTIVE in the ring. [#4262](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4262)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: skip already planned compaction jobs if the tenant doesn't belong to the compactor instance anymore. #303\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: Blocks cleaner will ignore users that it no longer \"owns\" when sharding is enabled, and user ownership has changed since last scan. #325\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: added `-compactor.compaction-jobs-order` support to configure which compaction jobs should run first for a given tenant (in case there are multiple ones). Supported values are: `smallest-range-oldest-blocks-first` (default), `newest-blocks-first`. #364\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: delete blocks marked for deletion faster. #490\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: expose low-level concurrency options for compactor: `-compactor.max-opening-blocks-concurrency`, `-compactor.max-closing-blocks-concurrency`, `-compactor.symbols-flushers-concurrency`. #569 #701\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Compactor: expand compactor logs to include total compaction job time, total time for uploads and block counts. #549\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: allow experimental configuration of disabling of heartbeat timeouts by setting the relevant configuration value to zero. Applies to the following: [#4342](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4342)\n  * `-distributor.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\n  * `-ingester.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\n  * `-ruler.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\n  * `-compactor.ring.heartbeat-timeout`\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.heartbeat-timeout`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ring: allow heartbeats to be explicitly disabled by setting the interval to zero. This is considered experimental. This applies to the following configuration options: [#4344](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4344)\n  * `-distributor.ring.heartbeat-period`\n  * `-ingester.ring.heartbeat-period`\n  * `-ruler.ring.heartbeat-period`\n  * `-alertmanager.sharding-ring.heartbeat-period`\n  * `-compactor.ring.heartbeat-period`\n  * `-store-gateway.sharding-ring.heartbeat-period`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: optimized receive path for processing ring state updates, to help reduce CPU utilization in large clusters.

[#4346](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4346)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: Add `-memberlist.advertise-addr` and `-memberlist.advertise-port` options for setting the address to advertise to other members of the cluster to enable NAT traversal. #260\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Memberlist: reduce CPU utilization for rings with a large number of members. #537 #563 #634\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Overrides exporter: include additional limits in the per-tenant override exporter. The following limits have been added to the `cortex_limit_overrides` metric: #21\n  * `max_fetched_series_per_query`\n  * `max_fetched_chunk_bytes_per_query`\n  * `ruler_max_rules_per_rule_group`\n  * `ruler_max_rule_groups_per_tenant`\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Overrides exporter: add a metrics `cortex_limits_defaults` to expose the default values of limits. #173\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Overrides exporter: Add `max_fetched_chunks_per_query` and `max_global_exemplars_per_user` limits to the default and per-tenant limits exported as metrics. #471 #515\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgrade Go to 1.17.8. #1347 #1381\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Upgrade Docker base images to `alpine:3.15.0`. #1348\n* [BUGFIX] Azure storage: only create HTTP client once, to reduce memory utilization. #605\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fixed ingester stuck on start up (LEAVING ring state) when `-ingester.ring.heartbeat-period=0` and `-ingester.unregister-on-shutdown=false`. [#4366](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4366)\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: prevent any reads or writes while the ingester is stopping. This will prevent accessing TSDB blocks once they have been already closed. [#4304](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4304)\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: TSDB now waits for pending readers before truncating Head block, fixing the `chunk not found` error and preventing wrong query results. #16\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: don't create TSDB or appender if no samples are sent by a tenant. #162\n* [BUGFIX] Ingester: fix out-of-order chunks in TSDB head in-memory series after WAL replay in case some samples were appended to TSDB WAL before series. #530\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: when cleaning up obsolete elected replicas from KV store, HA tracker didn't update number of cluster per user correctly. [#4336](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4336)\n* [BUGFIX] Distributor: fix bug in query-exemplar where some results would get dropped. #583\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: Fixes @ modifier functions (start/end) when splitting queries by time. #206\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: Ensure query_range requests handled by the query-frontend return JSON formatted errors. #360 #499\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: don't reuse cached results for queries that are not step-aligned. #424\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: fix API error messages that were mentioning Prometheus `--enable-feature=promql-negative-offset` and `--enable-feature=promql-at-modifier` flags. #688\n* [BUGFIX] Query-frontend: worker's cancellation channels are now buffered to ensure that all request cancellations are properly handled. #741\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: fixed `/api/v1/user_stats` endpoint. When zone-aware replication is enabled, `MaxUnavailableZones` param is used instead of `MaxErrors`, so setting `MaxErrors = 0` doesn't make the Querier wait for all Ingesters responses. #474\n* [BUGFIX] Querier: Disable query scheduler SRV DNS lookup. #689\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fixed counting of PromQL evaluation errors as user-errors when updating `cortex_ruler_queries_failed_total`. [#4335](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4335)\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: fix formatting of rule groups in `/ruler/rule_groups` endpoint. #655\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: do not log `unable to read rules directory` at startup if the directory hasn't been created yet. #1058\n* [BUGFIX] Ruler: enable Prometheus-compatible endpoints regardless of `-ruler.enable-api`. The flag now only controls the configuration API. This is what the config flag description stated, but not what was happening. #1216\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: fixed panic while collecting Prometheus metrics. #28\n* [BUGFIX] Compactor: compactor should now be able to correctly mark blocks for deletion and no-compaction, if such marking was previously interrupted. #1015\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: remove stale template files. #4495\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager: don't replace user configurations with blank fallback configurations (when enabled), particularly during scaling up/down instances when sharding is enabled. #224\n* [BUGFIX] Ring: multi KV runtime config changes are now propagated to all rings, not just ingester ring. #1047\n* [BUGFIX] Memberlist: fixed corrupted packets when sending compound messages with more than 255 messages or messages bigger than 64KB. #551\n* [BUGFIX] Overrides exporter: successfully startup even if runtime config is not set. #1056\n* [BUGFIX] Fix internal modules to wait for other modules depending on them before stopping. #1472\n\n### Mixin\n\n_Changes since `grafana/cortex-jsonnet` `1.9.0`._\n\n* [CHANGE] Removed chunks storage support from mixin. #641 #643 #645 #811 #812 #813\n  * Removed `tsdb.libsonnet`: no need to import it anymore (its content is already automatically included when using Jsonnet)\n  * Removed the following fields from `_config`:\n    * `storage_engine` (defaults to `blocks`)\n    * `chunk_index_backend`\n    * `chunk_store_backend`\n  * Removed schema config map\n  * Removed the following dashboards:\n    * \"Cortex / Chunks\"\n    * \"Cortex / WAL\"\n    * \"Cortex / Blocks vs Chunks\"\n  * Removed the following alerts:\n    * `CortexOldChunkInMemory`\n    * `CortexCheckpointCreationFailed`\n    * `CortexCheckpointDeletionFailed`\n    * `CortexProvisioningMemcachedTooSmall`\n    * `CortexWALCorruption`\n    * `CortexTableSyncFailure`\n    * `CortexTransferFailed`\n  * Removed the following recording rules:\n    * `cortex_chunk_store_index_lookups_per_query`\n    * `cortex_chunk_store_series_pre_intersection_per_query`\n    * `cortex_chunk_store_series_post_intersection_per_query`\n    * `cortex_chunk_store_chunks_per_query`\n    * `cortex_bigtable_request_duration_seconds`\n    * `cortex_cassandra_request_duration_seconds`\n    * `cortex_dynamo_request_duration_seconds`\n    * `cortex_database_request_duration_seconds`\n    * `cortex_gcs_request_duration_seconds`\n* [CHANGE] Update grafana-builder dependency: use $__rate_interval in qpsPanel and latencyPanel. [#372](https://github.com/grafana/cortex-jsonnet/pull/372)\n* [CHANGE] `namespace` template variable in dashboards now only selects namespaces for selected clusters. [#311](https://github.com/grafana/cortex-jsonnet/pull/311)\n* [CHANGE] `CortexIngesterRestarts` alert severity changed from `critical` to `warning`. [#321](https://github.com/grafana/cortex-jsonnet/pull/321)\n* [CHANGE] Dashboards: added overridable `job_labels` and `cluster_labels` to the configuration object as label lists to uniquely identify jobs and clusters in the metric names and group-by lists in dashboards. [#319](https://github.com/grafana/cortex-jsonnet/pull/319)\n* [CHANGE] Dashboards: `alert_aggregation_labels` has been removed from the configuration and overriding this value has been deprecated. Instead the labels are now defined by the `cluster_labels` list, and should be overridden accordingly through that list.

          "content": "---\ntitle: Governance\n---\n\n# Governance\n\nThis document describes the rules and governance of the project. It is meant to be followed by all the developers of the project and the Mimir community. Common terminology used in this governance document are listed below:\n\n- **Team members**: Any members of the private [team mailing list][team].\n\n- **Maintainers**: Maintainers lead an individual project or parts thereof ([`MAINTAINERS.md`][maintainers]).\n\n- **Projects**: A single repository in the Grafana GitHub organization and listed below is referred to as a project:\n\n  - Mimir\n\n- **The Mimir project**: The sum of all activities performed under this governance, concerning one or more repositories or the community.\n\n## Values\n\nThe Mimir developers and community are expected to follow the values defined in the [Code of Conduct][coc]. Furthermore, the Mimir community strives for kindness, giving feedback effectively, and building a welcoming environment. The Mimir developers generally decide by consensus and only resort to conflict resolution by a majority vote if consensus cannot be reached.\n\n## Projects\n\nEach project must have a [`MAINTAINERS.md`][maintainers] file with at least one maintainer. Where a project has a release process, access and documentation should be such that more than one person can perform a release. Releases should be announced on the [announcemount][announce] and [users][users] mailing lists. Any new projects should be first proposed on the [team mailing list][team] following the voting procedures listed below.\n\n## Decision making\n\n### Team members\n\nTeam member status may be given to those who have made ongoing contributions to the Mimir project for at least 3 months. This is usually in the form of code improvements and/or notable work on documentation, but organizing events or user support could also be taken into account.\n\nNew members may be proposed by any existing member by email to the [team mailing list][team]. It is highly desirable to reach consensus about acceptance of a new member. However, the proposal is ultimately voted on by a formal [supermajority vote](#supermajority-vote).\n\nIf the new member proposal is accepted, the proposed team member should be contacted privately via email to confirm or deny their acceptance of team membership. This email will also be CC'd to the [team mailing list][team] for record-keeping purposes.\n\nIf they choose to accept, the [onboarding](#onboarding) procedure is followed.\n\nTeam members may retire at any time by emailing [the team][team].\n\nTeam members can be removed by [supermajority vote](#supermajority-vote) on [the team mailing list][team].\nFor this vote, the member in question is not eligible to vote and does not count towards the quorum.\nAny removal vote can cover only one single person.\n\nUpon death of a member, they leave the team automatically.\n\nIn case a member leaves, the [offboarding](#offboarding) procedure is applied.\n\nThe current team members are:\n\n- Andy Asp [@andyasp](https://github.com/andyasp) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Arve Knudsen — [@aknuds1](https://github.com/aknuds1) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Bryan Boreham — [@bboreham](https://github.com/bboreham) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Casie Chen — [@chencs](https://github.com/chencs) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Charles Korn — [@charleskorn](https://github.com/charleskorn) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- David Grant [@seizethedave](https://github.com/seizethedave) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Dimitar Dimitrov - [@dimitarvdimitrov](https://github.com/dimitarvdimitrov) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Fayzal Ghantiwala [@fayzal-g](https://github.com/fayzal) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Felix Beuke [@flxbk](https://github.com/flxbk) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Franco Posa [@francoposa](https://github.com/francoposa) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- George Krajcsovits - [@krajorama](https://github.com/krajorama) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Jeanette Tan [@zenador](https://github.com/zenador) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Jon Kartago Lamida [@lamida](https://github.com/lamida) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Jonathan Halterman [@jhalterman](https://github.com/jhalterman) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Josh Abreu Mesa [@gotjosh](https://github.com/gotjosh) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Joshua Hesketh [@jhesketh](https://github.com/jhesketh) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Justin Lei [@leizor](https://github.com/leizor) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Marco Pracucci — [@pracucci](https://github.com/pracucci) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Mauro Stettler — [@replay](https://github.com/replay) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Miguel Ángel Ortuño [@ortuman](https://github.com/ortuman) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Nick Pillitteri — [@56quarters](https://github.com/56quarters) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Oleg Zaytsev — [@colega](https://github.com/colega) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Patrick Oyarzun - [@Logiraptor](https://github.com/Logiraptor) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Patryk Prus [@pr00se](https://github.com/pr00se) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Peter Štibraný — [@pstibrany](https://github.com/pstibrany) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Vernon Miller [@aldernero](https://github.com/aldernero) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Vladimir Varankin [@narqo](https://github.com/narqo) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Ying-jeanne Wang [@ying-jeanne](https://github.com/ying-jeanne) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n- Đurica Yuri Nikolić [@duricanikolic](https://github.com/duricanikolic) ([Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/))\n\nPrevious team members:\n\n- Goutham Veeramachaneni — [@gouthamve](https://github.com/gouthamve)\n- Jacob Lisi — [@jtlisi](https://github.com/jtlisi)\n- Steve Simpson - [@stevesg](https://github.com/stevesg)\n- Tom Wilkie — [@tomwilkie](https://github.com/tomwilkie)\n\n### Maintainers\n\nMaintainers lead one or more project(s) or parts thereof and serve as a point of conflict resolution amongst the contributors to this project. Ideally, maintainers are also team members, but exceptions are possible for suitable maintainers that, for whatever reason, are not yet team members.\n\nChanges in maintainership follows this process:\n\n- For Grafana Cloud Hosted Metrics engineers, an engineer is automatically added as maintainer as soon as they join the on-call rotation.\n- For other people, changes in maintainership have to be announced on the [developers mailing list][devs] and they are decided by rough consensus.\n\nChanges in maintainership are formalized by modifying the [`MAINTAINERS.md`][maintainers] file.\n\nMaintainers are granted commit rights to all projects covered by this governance.\n\nA maintainer or committer may resign by notifying the [team mailing list][team]. A maintainer with no project activity for a year is considered to have resigned. Maintainers that wish to resign are encouraged to propose another team member to take over the project.\n\nA project may have multiple maintainers, as long as the responsibilities are clearly agreed upon between them. This includes coordinating who handles which issues and pull requests.\n\n### Technical decisions\n\nTechnical decisions that only affect a single project are made informally by the maintainer of this project, and [rough consensus](#consensus) is assumed. Technical decisions that span multiple parts of the project should be discussed and made on the [developer mailing list][devs].\n\nDecisions are usually made by [rough consensus](#consensus). If no consensus can be reached, the matter may be resolved by [majority vote](#majority-vote).\n\n### Governance changes\n\nChanges to this document are made by Grafana Labs.\n\n### Other matters\n\nAny matter that needs a decision may be called to a vote by any member if they deem it necessary. For private or personnel matters, discussion and voting takes place on the [team mailing list][team], otherwise on the [developer mailing list][devs].\n\n## Voting\n\nThe Mimir project usually runs by informal consensus, however sometimes a formal decision must be made.\n\nDepending on the subject matter, as laid out [above](#decision-making), different methods of voting are used.\n\nFor all votes, voting must be open for at least one week. The end date should be clearly stated in the call to vote. A vote may be called and closed early if enough votes have come in one way so that further votes cannot change the final decision.\n\nIn all cases, all and only [team members](#team-members) are eligible to vote, with the sole exception of the forced removal of a team member, in which said member is not eligible to vote.\n\nDiscussion and votes on personnel matters (including but not limited to team membership and maintainership) are held in private on the [team mailing list][team]. All other discussion and votes are held in public on the [developer mailing list][devs].\n\nFor public discussions, anyone interested is encouraged to participate. Formal power to object or vote is limited to [team members](#team-members).\n\n### Consensus\n\nThe default decision making mechanism for the Mimir project is [rough][rough] consensus. This means that any decision on technical issues is considered supported by the [team][team] as long as nobody objects or the objection has been considered but not necessarily accommodated.\n\nSilence on any consensus decision is implicit agreement and equivalent to explicit agreement. Explicit agreement may be stated at will. Decisions may, but do not need to be called out and put up for decision on the [developers mailing list][devs] at any time and by anyone.\n\nConsensus decisions can never override or go against the spirit of an earlier explicit vote.\n\nIf any [team member](#team-members) raises objections, the team members work together towards a solution that all involved can accept. This solution is again subject to rough consensus.\n\nIn case no consensus can be found, but a decision one way or the other must be made, any [team member](#team-members) may call a formal [majority vote](#majority-vote).\n\n### Majority vote\n\nMajority votes must be called explicitly in a separate thread on the appropriate mailing list. The subject must be prefixed with `[VOTE]`. In the body, the call to vote must state the proposal being voted on. It should reference any discussion leading up to this point.\n\nVotes may take the form of a single proposal, with the option to vote yes or no, or the form of multiple alternatives.\n\nA vote on a single proposal is considered successful if more vote in favor than against.\n\nIf there are multiple alternatives, members may vote for one or more alternatives, or vote “no” to object to all alternatives. It is not possible to cast an “abstain” vote. A vote on multiple alternatives is considered decided in favor of one alternative if it has received the most votes in favor, and a vote from more than half of those voting. Should no alternative reach this quorum, another vote on a reduced number of options may be called separately.\n\n### Supermajority vote\n\nSupermajority votes must be called explicitly in a separate thread on the appropriate mailing list. The subject must be prefixed with `[VOTE]`. In the body, the call to vote must state the proposal being voted on. It should reference any discussion leading up to this point.\n\nVotes may take the form of a single proposal, with the option to vote yes or no, or the form of multiple alternatives.\n\nA vote on a single proposal is considered successful if at least two thirds of those eligible to vote vote in favor.\n\nIf there are multiple alternatives, members may vote for one or more alternatives, or vote “no” to object to all alternatives. A vote on multiple alternatives is considered decided in favor of one alternative if it has received the most votes in favor, and a vote from at least two thirds of those eligible to vote. Should no alternative reach this quorum, another vote on a reduced number of options may be called separately.\n\n## On- / Offboarding\n\n### Onboarding\n\nThe new member is\n\n- added to the list of [team members](#team-members) (`GOVERNANCE.md` and `MAINTAINERS.md`). Ideally by sending a PR of their own, at least approving said PR.\n- announced on the [developers mailing list][devs] by an existing team member. Ideally, the new member replies in this thread, acknowledging team membership.\n- added to the projects with commit rights.\n- added to the [team mailing list][team].\n\n### Offboarding\n\nThe ex-member is\n\n- removed from the list of [team members](#team-members). Ideally by sending a PR of their own, at least approving said PR. In case of forced removal, no approval is needed.\n- removed from the projects. Optionally, they can retain maintainership of one or more repositories if the [team](#team-members) agrees.\n- removed from the team mailing list and demoted to a normal member of the other mailing lists.\n- not allowed to call themselves an active team member any more, nor allowed to imply this to be the case.\n- added to a list of previous members if they so choose.\n\nIf needed, we reserve the right to publicly announce removal.\n\n[announce]: https://github.com/grafana/mimir/discussions/categories/announcements\n[coc]: https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[devs]: https://github.com/grafana/mimir/discussions/categories/development\n[maintainers]: https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md\n[rough]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282\n[team]: https://groups.google.com/g/mimir-team\n[users]: https://github.com/grafana/mimir/discussions\n"

By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n"

Some of the core strengths of Grafana Mimir include:\n\n- **Easy to install and maintain:** Grafana Mimir’s extensive documentation, tutorials, and deployment tooling make it quick to get started. Using its monolithic mode, you can get Grafana Mimir up and running with just one binary and no additional dependencies. Once deployed, the best-practice dashboards, alerts, and runbooks packaged with Grafana Mimir make it easy to monitor the health of the system.\n- **Massive scalability:** You can run Grafana Mimir's horizontally-scalable architecture across multiple machines, resulting in the ability to process orders of magnitude more time series than a single Prometheus instance. Internal testing shows that Grafana Mimir handles up to 1 billion active time series.\n- **Global view of metrics:** Grafana Mimir enables you to run queries that aggregate series from multiple Prometheus instances, giving you a global view of your systems. Its query engine extensively parallelizes query execution, so that even the highest-cardinality queries complete with blazing speed.\n- **Cheap, durable metric storage:** Grafana Mimir uses object storage for long-term data storage, allowing it to take advantage of this ubiquitous, cost-effective, high-durability technology. It is compatible with multiple object store implementations, including AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, OpenStack Swift, as well as any S3-compatible object storage.\n- **High availability:** Grafana Mimir replicates incoming metrics, ensuring that no data is lost in the event of machine failure. Its horizontally scalable architecture also means that it can be restarted, upgraded, or downgraded with zero downtime, which means no interruptions to metrics ingestion or querying.\n- **Natively multi-tenant:** Grafana Mimir’s multi-tenant architecture enables you to isolate data and queries from independent teams or business units, making it possible for these groups to share the same cluster. Advanced limits and quality-of-service controls ensure that capacity is shared fairly among tenants.\n\n## Migrating to Grafana Mimir\n\nIf you're migrating to Grafana Mimir, refer to the following documents:\n\n- [Migrating from Thanos or Prometheus to Grafana Mimir](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/set-up/migrate/migrate-from-thanos-or-prometheus/).\n- [Migrating from Cortex to Grafana Mimir](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/set-up/migrate/migrate-from-cortex/)\n\n## Deploying Grafana Mimir\n\nFor information about how to deploy Grafana Mimir, refer to [Deploy Grafana Mimir](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/operators-guide/deploy-grafana-mimir/).\n\n## Getting started\n\nIf you’re new to Grafana Mimir, read the [Get started guide](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/get-started/).\n\nBefore deploying Grafana Mimir in a production environment, read:\n\n1.

Release shepherds are chosen on a voluntary basis.\n\n## Release schedule\n\nA new Grafana Mimir release is cut approximately once every quarter, at the beginning of March, June, September and December.\nThe following table contains past releases and tentative dates for upcoming releases:\n\n| Version | Date       | Release shepherd   |\n| ------- | ---------- | ------------------ |\n| 2.0.0   | 2022-03-20 | Marco Pracucci     |\n| 2.1.0   | 2022-05-16 | Johanna Ratliff    |\n| 2.2.0   | 2022-06-27 | Oleg Zaytsev       |\n| 2.3.0   | 2022-08-08 | Tyler Reid         |\n| 2.4.0   | 2022-10-10 | Marco Pracucci     |\n| 2.5.0   | 2022-11-28 | Mauro Stettler     |\n| 2.6.0   | 2023-01-16 | Nick Pillitteri    |\n| 2.7.0   | 2023-03-06 | Vernon Miller      |\n| 2.8.0   | 2023-04-17 | Jon Kartago Lamida |\n| 2.9.0   | 2023-05-29 | Felix Beuke        |\n| 2.10.0  | 2023-09-06 | Oleg Zaytsev       |\n| 2.11.0  | 2023-12-06 | Justin Lei         |\n| 2.12.0  | 2024-03-11 | Yuri Nikolic       |\n| 2.13.0  | 2024-06-17 | Dimitar Dimitrov   |\n| 2.14.0  | 2024-10-07 | Vladimir Varankin  |\n| 2.15.0  | 2024-12-12 | Casie Chen         |\n| 2.16.0  | 2025-03-10 | _To be announced_  |\n\n## Release shepherd responsibilities\n\nThe release shepherd is responsible for an entire minor release series, meaning all pre- and patch releases of a minor release.\nThe process formally starts with the initial pre-release, but some preparations should be made a few days in advance.\n\n- We aim to keep the `main` branch in a working state at all times.\n  In principle, it should be possible to cut a release from `main` at any time.\n  In practice, things might not work out as nicely.\n  A few days before the pre-release is scheduled, the shepherd should check the state of `main` branch.\n  Following their best judgement, the shepherd should try to expedite bug fixes that are still in progress but should make it into the release.\n  On the other hand, the shepherd may hold back merging last-minute invasive and risky changes that are better suited for the next minor release.\n- There may be some actions left to address when cutting this release.\n  The release shepherd is responsible for going through TODOs in the repository and verifying that nothing that is due this release is forgotten.\n- On the planned release date, the release shepherd cuts the first pre-release (using the suffix `-rc.0`) and creates a new branch called `release-<major>.<minor>` starting at the commit tagged for the pre-release.\n  New branch `release-<major>-<minor>` should be branched out from latest weekly release `r<xxx>`, where <xxx> is the weekly release number.\n  In general, a pre-release is considered a release candidate (that's what `rc` stands for) and should therefore not contain any known bugs that are planned to be fixed in the final release.\n- With the pre-release, the release shepherd is responsible for coordinating or running the release candidate in any end user production environment for at least 1 week.\n  This is typically done at Grafana Labs.\n- If regressions or critical bugs are detected, they need to get fixed before cutting a new pre-release (called `-rc.1`, `-rc.2`, etc.).\n\nSee the next section for details on cutting an individual release.\n\n## How to cut an individual release\n\n### Release issue template\n\nThe quick and easy way to create a GitHub issue using the following template and follow the instructions from the issue itself.\nIf something is not clear, you can get back to this document to learn more about the process.\n\n> **Note:** Branches with `release-` prefix in the name are protected, use some different branch name for making your PRs, for example `my/release-notes`.\n\n````markdown\n### Publish the release candidate\n\n- [ ] Begin drafting the [release notes](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/RELEASE.md#write-release-notes-document)\n  - Create the release notes PR targeting the main branch\n  - This step shouldn't block from publishing release candidate\n  - After the release notes PR is merged (which usually happen after RC is published), cherry-pick them into the release branch\n- [ ] Wait for any open PR we want to get merged before cutting the release candidate\n  - We shouldn't wait for the open PRs beyond the scheduled release date\n- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md`\n  - [ ] Run `./tools/release/check-changelog.sh LAST-RELEASE-TAG...main` and add missing PRs to CHANGELOG\n  - [ ] Ensure CHANGELOG entries are [sorted by type](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/docs/internal/contributing/README.md#changelog)\n  - [ ] Add a new section for the new release so that `## main / unreleased` is blank and at the top. The new section should say `## x.y.0-rc.0`.\n- [ ] Run `./tools/release/notify-changelog-cut.sh CHANGELOG.md`\n- [ ] Run `make mixin-screenshots`\n  - Before opening the PR, review all updated screenshots and ensure no sensitive data is disclosed\n- [ ] Create new release branch\n  - [ ] Create the branch\n    ```bash\n    git checkout r<xxx> # xxx is the latest weekly release\n    git checkout -b release-<version>\n    git push -u origin release-<version>\n    ```\n  - [ ] Remove \"main / unreleased\" section from the CHANGELOG\n  - [ ] If a new minor or major version is being released, adjust the settings in the `renovate.json5` configuration on the `main` branch by adding the new version.\n        This way we ensure that dependency updates maintain the new version, as well as the latest two minor versions.\n        For instance, if versions 3.0 and 2.10 are configured in `renovate.json`, and version 3.1 is being released,\n        during the release process `renovate.json5` should keep updated the following branches: `main`, `release-3.1`, `release-3.0` and `release-2.10`.\n- [ ] Publish the Mimir release candidate\n  - [ ] Update VERSION in the release branch and update CHANGELOG with version and release date.\n    - Keep in mind this is a release candidate, so the version string in VERSION and CHANGELOG must end in `-rc.#`, where `#` is the release candidate number, starting at 0.\n  - [ ] [Tag the release](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/RELEASE.md#how-to-tag-a-release)\n    ```bash\n    git checkout release-<version>\n    ./tools/release/tag-release.sh\n    ```\n  - [ ] Wait until the CI pipeline succeeds\n  - [ ] [Create a pre-release on GitHub](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/RELEASE.md#creating-release-on-github)\n    ```bash\n    git checkout release-<version>\n    ./tools/release/create-draft-release.sh\n    ```\n  - [ ] [Merge the release branch release-<version> into main](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/RELEASE.md#merging-release-branch-into-main)\n    ```bash\n    ./tools/release/create-pr-to-merge-release-branch-to-main.sh\n    ```\n    This prepares a PR into `main` branch.

Follow the instructions in [Release process for a final release](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed/RELEASE.md#release-process-for-a-final-release)\n````\n\n### Branch management and versioning strategy\n\nWe use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).\n\nWe maintain a separate branch for each minor release, named `release-<major>.<minor>`, e.g. `release-1.1`, `release-2.0`.\n\nThe usual flow is to merge new features and changes into the `main` branch and to merge bug fixes into the latest release branch.\nBug fixes are then merged into `main` from the latest release branch.\nThe `main` branch should always contain all commits from the latest release branch.\nAs long as `main` hasn't deviated significantly from the release branch, new commits can also go to `main`, followed by cherry-picking them back into the release branch. See [Cherry-picking changes into release branch](#cherry-picking-changes-into-release-branch).\n\nMaintaining the release branches for older minor releases happens on a best effort basis.\n\n### Show that a release is in progress\n\nThis helps ongoing PRs to get their changes in the right place, and to consider whether they need cherry-picking into release branch.\n\n1. Make a PR to update `CHANGELOG.md` on main\n   - Add a new section for the new release so that `## main / unreleased` is blank and at the top.\n   - The new section should say `## x.y.0-rc.0`.\n1. Get this PR reviewed and merged.\n1. Run `./tools/release/notify-changelog-cut.sh CHANGELOG.md` to comment on open PRs with a CHANGELOG entry to rebase on `main` and move the CHANGELOG entry to the top under `## main / unreleased`\n\n### Prepare your release\n\nFor a new major or minor release, create the corresponding release branch based on the main branch.\nFor a patch release, work in the branch of the minor release you want to patch.\n\nTo prepare a release branch, first create new release branch (release-X.Y) in the Mimir repository from the main commit of your choice,\nand then do the following steps on a temporary branch (prepare-release-X.Y) and make a PR to merge said branch into\nthe new release branch (prepare-release-X.Y -> release-X.Y):\n\n1. Make sure you've a GPG key associated with your GitHub account (`git tag` will be signed with that GPG key)\n   - You can add a GPG key to your GitHub account following [this procedure](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-gpg-key/)\n     - You may run into:\n     ```\n     error: gpg failed to sign the data\n     error: unable to sign the tag\n     ```\n     - Follow the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key#telling-git-about-your-gpg-key) to tell Git about your GPG key.\n1. Update the version number in the `VERSION` file to say `X.Y-rc.0`\n1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`\n   - Ensure changelog entries for the new release are in this order:\n     - `[CHANGE]`\n     - `[FEATURE]`\n     - `[ENHANCEMENT]`\n     - `[BUGFIX]`\n   - Run `./tools/release/check-changelog.sh LAST-RELEASE-TAG...main` and add any missing PR which includes user-facing changes.\n   - `check-changelog.sh` script also reports number of PRs and authors on the top. Note the numbers and include them in the release notes in GitHub.\n\nOnce your release preparation PR is approved, merge it to the `release-X.Y` branch, and continue with publishing.\n\n### Write release notes document\n\nEach Grafana Mimir release comes with a release notes that is published on the website. This document is stored in `docs/sources/mimir/release-notes/`,\nand contains following sections:\n\n- Features and enhancements\n- Upgrade considerations\n- Bug fixes\n\nPlease write a draft release notes PR, and get it approved by Grafana Mimir's Product Manager (or ask PM to send PR with the document).\nMake sure that release notes document for new version is available from the release branch, and not just `main`.\nSee [PR 1848](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/1848) for an example PR.\n\n### Publish a release candidate\n\nTo publish a release candidate:\n\n1. Do not change the release branch directly; make a PR to the release-X.Y branch with VERSION and any CHANGELOG changes.\n   1. Ensure the `VERSION` file has the `-rc.X` suffix (`X` starting from `0`).\n1. After merging your PR to the release branch, run `./tools/release/tag-release.sh` to tag the new release from the release branch (see [How to tag a release](#how-to-tag-a-release)).\n1. Wait until the CI pipeline succeeds (once a tag is created, the release process through GitHub Actions will be triggered for this tag).\n1. Merge the release branch `release-x.y` into `main` (see [Merging release branch into main](#merging-release-branch-into-main))\n1. Create a pre-release on GitHub. See [Creating release on GitHub](#creating-release-on-github).\n\n### Creating release on GitHub\n\n**How to create the release using the script:**\n\n```bash\ngit checkout release-<version>\n\n# Ensure you are authenticated and there is not a stale token in the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable\ngh auth login\n\n# Then run the following script and follow the instructions:\n./tools/release/create-draft-release.sh\n```\n\n**How to create the release manually:**\n\n1. Go to https://github.com/grafana/mimir/releases/new to start a new release on GitHub (or click \"Draft a new release\" at https://github.com/grafana/mimir/releases page.)\n1. Select your new tag, use `Mimir <VERSION>` as Release Title. Check that \"Previous tag\" next to \"Generate release notes\" button shows previous Mimir release.\n   Click \"Generate release notes\" button. This will pre-fill the changelog for the release.\n   You can delete all of it, but keep \"New Contributors\" section and \"Full Changelog\" link for later.\n1. Release description consists of:\n   - \"This release contains XX contributions from YY authors. Thank you!\" at the beginning.\n     You can find the numbers by running `./tools/release/check-changelog.sh LAST-RELEASE-TAG...NEW-RELEASE-TAG`.\n     As an example, running the script with `mimir-2.0.0...mimir-2.1.0` argument reports `Found 417 PRs from 47 authors.`.\n   - After contributor stats, please include content of the release notes document [created previously](#write-release-notes-document).\n   - After release notes, please copy-paste content of CHANGELOG.md file since the previous release.\n   - After CHANGELOG, please include \"New Contributors\" section and \"Full Changelog\" link at the end.\n     Both were created previously by \"Generate release notes\" button in GitHub UI.\n1. Build binaries with `make BUILD_IN_CONTAINER=true dist` and attach them to the release (building in container ensures standardized toolchain).\n\n### Publish a stable release\n\n> **Note:** Technical documentation is automatically published on release tags or release branches with a corresponding\n> release tag. The workflow that publishes documentation is defined in [`publish-technical-documentation-release.yml`](.github/workflows/publish-technical-documentation-release.yml).\n\n> **Note:** Homebrew's [autobump job](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/actions/workflows/autobump.yml)\n> automatically updates the [`mimirtool` Homebrew formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/mimirtool.rb).\n> The autobump job runs once every 24 hours, so it might take a day or two for the updated formula to be created and published.\n\nTo publish a stable release:\n\n1. Do not change the release branch directly; make a PR to the `release-X.Y` branch with VERSION and any CHANGELOG changes.\n   1. Ensure the `VERSION` file has **no** `-rc.X` suffix\n   1. Update the Mimir version in the following locations:\n      - `operations/mimir/images.libsonnet` (`_images.mimir` and `_images.query_tee` fields)\n      - `operations/mimir-rules-action/Dockerfile` (`grafana/mimirtool` image tag)\n   1. Update Jsonnet tests: `make build-jsonnet-tests`\n   1. Commit updated tests\n1. Update dashboard screenshots\n   1. Make sure that operations/mimir-mixin-tools/screenshots/.config is configured according to the directions in [operations/mimir-mixin-tools/screenshots/run.sh](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/operations/mimir-mixin-tools/screenshots/run.sh)\n   1. Make sure that operations/mimir-mixin-tools/serve/.config is configured according to the directions in [operations/mimir-mixin-tools/serve/run.sh](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/operations/mimir-mixin-tools/serve/run.sh)\n   1. Run `make mixin-screenshots`\n   1. Review all updated screenshots and ensure no sensitive data is disclosed\n   1. Open a PR\n1. After merging your PR to the release branch, run `./tools/release/tag-release.sh` to tag the new release from the release branch (see [How to tag a release](#how-to-tag-a-release)).\n1. Wait until the CI pipeline succeeds (once a tag is created, the release process through GitHub Actions will be triggered for this tag)\n1. Create a release on GitHub.\n   1. See [Creating release on GitHub](#creating-release-on-github) again.\n   1. Copy the release notes from pre-release version, with up-to-date CHANGELOG (if there were any changes in release candidates).\n   1. Don't forget the binaries, you'll need to build them again for this version.\n1. Merge the release branch `release-x.y` into `main` (see [Merging release branch into main](#merging-release-branch-into-main))\n1. Check the `README.md` file for any broken links.\n1. Open a PR to **add** the new version to the backward compatibility integration test (`integration/backward_compatibility_test.go`)\n   - Keep the last 3 minor releases\n1. Publish dashboards (done by a Grafana Labs member)\n   1. Login to [https://grafana.com](https://grafana.com) with your Grafana Labs account\n      1. Make sure your user in the Grafana Labs organization members list has Admin access.\n   1. Open [https://grafana.com/orgs/grafana/dashboards](https://grafana.com/orgs/grafana/dashboards)\n   1. For each dashboard at `operations/mimir-mixin-compiled/dashboards`:\n      1. Open the respective dashboard page\n      1. Click \"Revisions\" tab\n      1. Click \"Upload new revision\" and upload the updated `.json`\n\n### How to tag a release\n\n**How to tag a release:**\n\n```bash\ngit checkout release-<version>\n./tools/release/tag-release.sh\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\nEvery release is tagged with `mimir-<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, e.g. `mimir-2.0.0`.\nNote the `mimir-` prefix, which we use to specifically avoid the Go compiler recognizing them as version tags.\nWe don't want compatibility with Go's module versioning scheme, since it would require us to keep each major version's\ncode in its own directory beneath the repository root, f.ex. v2/.\n\n### Cherry-picking changes into release branch\n\nTo cherry-pick a change (commit) from `main` into release branch we use a GitHub action and labels:\n\nAdd a `backport <release-branch>` label to the PR you want to cherry-pick, where `<release-branch>` is the branch name\naccording to [Branch management and versioning strategy](#branch-management-and-versioning-strategy).\nYou can add this label before or after the PR is merged. Grafanabot will open a PR targeting the release\nbranch with the merge commit of the PR you labelled. See [PR#2290 (original PR)](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2290) and\n[PR#2364 (backport PR)](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/2364) for an example pair.\n\nIn case the automated backport failed, follow the steps from grafanabot's comment to do a manual cherry-pick.\n\n### Merging release branch into main\n\nTo merge a release branch `release-X.Y` into `main`:\n\n1. Create a PR to merge `release-X.Y` into `main` (_see below_)\n2. Once approved, merge the PR with a **Merge** commit through one of the following strategies:\n   - Temporarily enable \"Allow merge commits\" option in \"Settings > Options\"\n   - Locally merge the `merge-release-X.Y-to-main` branch into `main`, and push the changes to `main` back to GitHub. This doesn't break `main` branch protection, since the PR has been approved already, and it also doesn't require removing the protection.\n   - Using `tools/release/merge-approved-pr-branch-to-main.sh` script, which will do the merge and push automatically (in a safe way).\n\n**How to create the PR using the script:**\n\n```bash\n# Run the following script and follow the instructions:\n./tools/release/create-pr-to-merge-release-branch-to-main.sh\n```\n\n**How to create the PR manually:**\n\n- Create `merge-release-X.Y-to-main` branch **from the upstream `main` branch** locally\n- Merge the `release-X.Y` branch into your `merge-release-X.Y-to-main` branch and resolve conflicts\n  - Keep the `main`'s `VERSION` file contents\n- Make a PR for merging your `merge-release-X.Y-to-main` branch into `main`\n"
