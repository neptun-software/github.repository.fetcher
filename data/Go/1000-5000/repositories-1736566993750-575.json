          "content": "# Sonobuoy Governance\n\nThis document defines the project governance for Sonobuoy.\n\n## Overview\n\nSonobuoy, an open source project, is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and self-governing open source community focused on building a high quality tool that enables users to check the conformance of their Kubernetes clusters as well as perform automated cluster validations. The community is governed by this document with the goal of defining how community should work together to achieve this goal.\n\n## Code Repositories\n\nThe following code repositories are governed by Sonobuoy community and maintained under the vmware-tanzu\\sonobuoy organization.\n\n - [Sonobuoy][sonobuoyRepo]: Main Sonobuoy codebase\n - [Sonobuoy Plugins][sonobuoyPluginsRepo]: This repository contains Sonobuoy plugins\n\n## Community Roles\n\n - Users: Members that engage with the Sonobuoy community via any medium (Slack, GitHub, mailing lists, etc.).\n - Contributors: Regular contributions to projects (documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participation in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc.).\n - Maintainers: The Sonobuoy project leaders. They are responsible for the overall health and direction of the project; final reviewers of PRs and responsible for releases. Some Maintainers are responsible for one or more components within a project, acting as technical leads for that component. Maintainers are expected to contribute code and documentation, review PRs including ensuring quality of code, triage issues, proactively fix bugs, and perform maintenance tasks for these components.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nNew maintainers must be nominated by an existing maintainer and must be elected by a supermajority of existing maintainers. Likewise, maintainers can be removed by a supermajority of the existing maintainers or can resign by notifying one of the maintainers.\n\n## Supermajority\n\nA supermajority is defined as two-thirds of members in the group. A supermajority of Maintainers is required for certain decisions as outlined above. A supermajority vote is equivalent to the number of votes in favor being at least twice the number of votes against. For example, if you have 5 maintainers, a supermajority vote is 4 votes. Voting on decisions can happen on the mailing list, GitHub, Slack, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. Maintainers can either vote \"agree, yes, +1\", \"disagree, no, -1\", or \"abstain\". A vote passes when supermajority is met. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.\n\n##  Decision Making\n\nIdeally, all project decisions are resolved by consensus. If impossible, any maintainer may call a vote. Unless otherwise specified in this document, any vote will be decided by a supermajority of maintainers.\n\nVotes by maintainers belonging to the same company will count as one vote; e.g., 4 maintainers employed by fictional company Valerium will only have one combined vote. If voting members from a given company do not agree, the company's vote is determined by a supermajority of voters from that company. If no supermajority is achieved, the company is considered to have abstained.\n\n## Proposal Process\n\nOne of the most important aspects in any open source community is the concept of proposals. Large changes to the codebase and / or new features should be preceded by a proposal in our community repo. This process allows for all members of the community to weigh in on the concept (including the technical details), share their comments and ideas, and offer to help. It also ensures that members are not duplicating work or inadvertently stepping on toes by making large conflicting changes.\n\nThe project roadmap is defined by accepted proposals.\n\nProposals should cover the high-level objectives, use cases, and technical recommendations on how to implement. In general, the community member(s) interested in implementing the proposal should be either deeply engaged in the proposal process or be an author of the proposal.\n\nThe proposal should be documented as a separated markdown file pushed to the root of the design folder in the Sonobuoy repository via PR. The name of the file should follow the name pattern <short meaningful words joined by '-'>_design.md, e.g: restore-hooks-design.md.\n\nUse the Proposal Template as a starting point.\n\n## Proposal Lifecycle\n\nThe proposal PR can follow the GitHub lifecycle of the PR to indicate its status:\n\n - Open: Proposal is created and under review and discussion.\n - Merged: Proposal has been reviewed and is accepted (either by consensus or through a vote).\n - Closed: Proposal has been reviewed and was rejected (either by consensus or through a vote).\n\n## Lazy Consensus\n\nTo maintain velocity in a project as busy as Sonobuoy, the concept of Lazy Consensus is practiced. Ideas and/or proposals should be shared by maintainers via GitHub with the appropriate maintainer groups (e.g., @vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy-maintainers) tagged. Out of respect for other contributors, major changes should also be accompanied by a ping on Slack as appropriate. Author(s) of proposal, Pull Requests, issues, etc. will give a time period of no less than five (5) working days for comment and remain cognizant of popular observed world holidays.\n\nOther maintainers may chime in and request additional time for review, but should remain cognizant of blocking progress and abstain from delaying progress unless absolutely needed. The expectation is that blocking progress is accompanied by a guarantee to review and respond to the relevant action(s) (proposals, PRs, issues, etc.) in short order.\n\nLazy Consensus is practiced for all projects in the Sonobuoy org, including the main project repository and the additional repositories.\n\nLazy consensus does not apply to the process of:\n\n - Removal of maintainers from Sonobuoy\n - Updating Governance\n - All substantive changes in Governance require a supermajority agreement by all maintainers.\n\n[sonobuoyRepo]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy\n[sonobuoyPluginsRepo]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy-plugins"

It is a\ncustomizable, extendable, and cluster-agnostic way to generate clear, informative reports about your cluster.\n\nIts selective data dumps of Kubernetes resource objects and cluster nodes allow for the following use cases:\n\n* Integrated end-to-end (e2e) [conformance-testing][e2ePlugin]\n* Workload debugging\n* Custom data collection via extensible plugins\n\nStarting v0.20, Sonobuoy supports Kubernetes v1.17 or later. Sonobuoy releases will be independent of Kubernetes\nrelease, while ensuring that new releases continue to work functionally across different versions of Kubernetes. Read\nmore about the new release cycles in [our blog][decoupling-sonobuoy-k8s].\n\n> Note: You can skip this version enforcement by running Sonobuoy with the `--skip-preflight` flag.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Access to an up-and-running Kubernetes cluster. If you do not have a cluster, we recommend either:\n  * following the [AWS Quickstart for Kubernetes][quickstart] instructions.\n  * setting up a local cluster using [KinD][kind]\n\n* An admin `kubeconfig` file, and the KUBECONFIG environment variable set.\n\n* For some advanced workflows it may be required to have `kubectl` installed.\n  See [installing via Homebrew (MacOS)][brew] or [building the binary (Linux)][linux].\n\n* The `sonobuoy images` subcommand requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to be installed.\n  See [installing Docker][docker].\n\n## Installation\n\nThe following methods exist for installing Sonobuoy:\n\n### Install binary\n\n1. Download the [latest release][releases] for your client platform.\n2. Extract the tarball:\n\n   ```\n   tar -xvf <RELEASE_TARBALL_NAME>.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n   Move the extracted `sonobuoy` executable to somewhere on your `PATH`.\n\n### Install with Hombrew (MacOS)\n\n1. Run the command:\n  \n   ```\n   brew install sonobuoy\n   ```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo launch conformance tests (ensuring [CNCF][cncf] conformance) and wait until they are finished run:\n\n```bash\nsonobuoy run --wait\n```\n\n> Note: Using `--mode quick` will significantly shorten the runtime of Sonobuoy. It runs just a single test, helping to quickly validate your Sonobuoy and Kubernetes configuration.\n\nGet the results from the plugins (e.g. e2e test results):\n\n```bash\nresults=$(sonobuoy retrieve)\n```\n\nInspect results for test failures. This will list the number of tests failed and their names:\n\n```bash\nsonobuoy results $results\n```\n\n> Note: The `results` command has lots of useful options for various situations. See the [results page][results] for more details.\n\nYou can also extract the entire contents of the file to get much more [detailed data][snapshot] about your cluster.\n\nSonobuoy creates a few resources in order to run and expects to run within its own namespace.\n\nDeleting Sonobuoy entails removing its namespace as well as a few cluster scoped resources.\n\n```bash\nsonobuoy delete --wait\n```\n\n> Note: The --wait option ensures the Kubernetes namespace is deleted, avoiding conflicts if another Sonobuoy run is started quickly.\n\nIf you have an issue with permissions in your cluster but you still want to run Sonobuoy, you can use `--aggregator-permissions` flag. Read more details about it [here][aggregator-permissions].\n\n### Other Tests\n\nBy default, `sonobuoy run` runs the Kubernetes conformance tests but this can easily be configured. The same plugin that\nhas the conformance tests has all the Kubernetes end-to-end tests which include other tests such as:\n\n* tests for specific storage features\n* performance tests\n* scaling tests\n* provider specific tests\n* and many more\n\nTo modify which tests you want to run, checkout our page on the [e2e plugin][e2ePlugin].\n\nIf you want to run other tests or tools which are not a part of the Kubernetes end-to-end suite, refer to our\ndocumentation on [custom plugins][customPlugins].\n\n### Monitoring Sonobuoy during a run\n\nYou can check on the status of each of the plugins running with:\n\n```bash\nsonobuoy status\n```\n\nYou can also inspect the logs of all Sonobuoy containers:\n\n```bash\nsonobuoy logs\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any problems that the documentation does not address, [file an issue][issue].\n\n## Docker Hub rate limit\n\nThis year, Docker has started rate limiting image pulls from Docker Hub. We're planning a future release with a better\nuser interface to work around this. Until then, this is the recommended approach.\n\n### Sonobuoy Pod\n\nSonobuoy by default pulls from Docker Hub for [`sonobuoy/sonobuoy` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonobuoy/sonobuoy).\nIf you're encountering rate limit on this, you can use VMware-provided mirror with:\n\n```bash\nsonobuoy run --sonobuoy-image projects.registry.vmware.com/sonobuoy/sonobuoy:<VERSION>\n```\n\n### Conformance\n\nKubernetes end-to-end conformance test pulls several images from Docker Hub as part of testing. To override this, you\nwill need to create a registry manifest file locally (e.g. `conformance-image-config.yaml`) containing the following:\n\n```yaml\ndockerLibraryRegistry: mirror.gcr.io/library\n```\n\nThen on running conformance:\n\n```bash\nsonobuoy run --sonobuoy-image projects.registry.vmware.com/sonobuoy/sonobuoy:<VERSION> --e2e-repo-config conformance-image-config.yaml\n```\n\nTechnically `dockerGluster` is also a registry pulling from Docker Hub, but it's not part of Conformance test suite at\nthe moment, so overriding `dockerLibraryRegistry` should be enough.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n### Leaked End-to-end namespaces\n\nThere are some Kubernetes e2e tests that may leak resources. Sonobuoy can help clean those up as well by deleting all\nnamespaces prefixed with `e2e`:\n\n```bash\nsonobuoy delete --all\n```\n\n### Run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\n\nSonobuoy requires admin permissions which won't be automatic if you are running via Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\ncluster. You must first create an admin role for the user under which you run Sonobuoy:\n\n```bash\nkubectl create clusterrolebinding <your-user-cluster-admin-binding> --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=<your.google.cloud.email@example.org>\n```\n\n### Run on Kubernetes for Docker Desktop\n\nWe don't recommend running via a cluster set up via Docker Desktop. Known issues include:\n\n- `kubectl logs` will not function\n- `sonobuoy logs` will not function\n- `sonobuoy retrieve` will not function\n- `systemd-logs` plugin will hang\n\nMost of these issues revolve around issues with kube-proxy on Docker Desktop so if you know of how to resolve these\nissues, let us know.\n\n### Certified-Conformance bug (versions v0.53.0 and v0.53.1)\n\nThese versions of Sonobuoy have a bug that runs the wrong set of tests without additional actions. See more\ndetails [here][issue1388]. The simplest way to avoid this is to update your version of Sonobuoy to >= v0.53.2.\n\n## Strategy Document\n\nSee our current [strategy document][strategy] and [roadmap][roadmap] for context on what our highest priority use cases and work items\nwill be. Feel free to make comments on Github or start conversations in Slack.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThanks for taking the time to join our community and start contributing! We welcome pull requests. Feel free to dig\nthrough the [issues][issue] and jump in.\n\nThe most common build/test functions are called via the Makefile:\n\n```\n// Build the binary\n$ make build\n\n// Run local unit tests\n$ make test\n```\n\nIf you make changes which change output, you may fail tests which utilize the golden file testing pattern (e.g. correct data is stored in external files), update them by running:\n```\n$ make golden\n```\n\nIn most cases, running integration tests is more simply done in CI when you open a pull request.\nYou can dig into scripts/build_funcs.sh and our .github/workflows/ci-test.yaml for exact details of existing test flows.\n\n### Before you start\n\n* Please familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct][coc] before contributing.\n* See [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] for instructions on the developer certificate of origin that we require.\n* There is a [Slack channel][slack] if you want to interact with other members of the community\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [the list of releases][releases] to find out about feature changes.\n\n[decoupling-sonobuoy-k8s]: https://sonobuoy.io/decoupling-sonobuoy-and-kubernetes\n\n[airgap]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/airgap\n\n[brew]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-with-homebrew-on-macos\n\n[cncf]: https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance#certified-kubernetes\n\n[coc]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n\n[contrib]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\n[docker]: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/\n\n[docs]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs\n\n[e2ePlugin]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/e2eplugin\n\n[customPlugins]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/plugins\n\n[gen]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/gen\n\n[issue]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/issues\n\n[issue1388]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/issue1388\n\n[k8s]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\n\n[kind]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind\n\n[linux]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#tabset-1\n\n[oview]: https://youtu.be/8QK-Hg2yUd4\n\n[plugins]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/plugins\n\n[quickstart]: https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vmware-kubernetes/\n\n[releases]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/releases\n\n[results]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/results\n\n[slack]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sonobuoy\n\n[snapshot]:https://sonobuoy.io/docs/snapshot\n\n[sonobuoyconfig]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/sonobuoy-config\n\n[strategy]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/strategy\n\n[aggregator-permissions]: https://sonobuoy.io/docs/aggregator-permissions\n\n[roadmap]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/wiki"

          "content": "# Security Release Process\n\nSonobuoy is a diagnostic tool that makes it easier to understand the\nstate of a Kubernetes cluster by running a set of plugins in an accessible and non-destructive manner. The community has adopted this security disclosure and response policy to ensure we responsibly handle critical issues.\n\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nOnly the most recent version of Sonobuoy is supported \nwith the ability to run conformance tests on the latest version of\nKubernetes (and two prior versions).  Each release contains additional \nrelease notes for details on changes.\n\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability - Private Disclosure Process\n\nSecurity is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected security vulnerabilities should be reported to Sonobuoy privately, to minimize attacks against current users of Sonobuoy before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be investigated and patched on the next patch (or minor) release as soon as possible. This information could be kept entirely internal to the project.\n\nIf you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability for Sonobuoy, please **IMMEDIATELY** contact the VMware Security Team (security@vmware.com).\n\n\n\n**IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities**\n\nTo report a vulnerability or a security-related issue, please contact the VMware email address with the details of the vulnerability. The email will be fielded by the VMware Security Team and then shared with the Sonobuoy maintainers who have committer and release permissions. Emails will be addressed within 3 business days, including a detailed plan to investigate the issue and any potential workarounds to perform in the meantime. Do not report non-security-impacting bugs through this channel. Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/issues) instead.\n\n\n## Proposed Email Content\n\nProvide a descriptive subject line and in the body of the email include the following information:\n\n\n\n*   Basic identity information, such as your name and your affiliation or company.\n*   Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability  (POC scripts, screenshots, and logs are all helpful to us).\n*   Description of the effects of the vulnerability on Sonobuoy and the related hardware and software configurations, so that the VMware Security Team can reproduce it.\n*   How the vulnerability affects Sonobuoy usage and an estimation of the attack surface, if there is one.\n*   List other projects or dependencies that were used in conjunction with Sonobuoy to produce the vulnerability.\n\n\n\n\n## When to report a vulnerability\n\n\n\n*   When you think Sonobuoy has a potential security vulnerability.\n*   When you suspect a potential vulnerability but you are unsure that it impacts Sonobuoy.\n*   When you know of or suspect a potential vulnerability on another project that is used by Sonobuoy.\n\n\n\n\n## Patch, Release, and Disclosure\n\nThe VMware Security Team will respond to vulnerability reports as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. The Security Team will investigate the vulnerability and determine its effects and criticality.\n2. If the issue is not deemed to be a vulnerability, the Security Team will follow up with a detailed reason for rejection.\n3. The Security Team will initiate a conversation with the reporter within 3 business days.\n4. If a vulnerability is acknowledged and the timeline for a fix is determined, the Security Team will work on a plan to communicate with the appropriate community, including identifying mitigating steps that affected users can take to protect themselves until the fix is rolled out.\n5. The Security Team will also create a [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) using the [CVSS Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0). The Security Team makes the final call on the calculated CVSS; it is better to move quickly than making the CVSS perfect. Issues may also be reported to [Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/) using this [scoring calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator). The CVE will initially be set to private.\n6. The Security Team will work on fixing the vulnerability and perform internal testing before preparing to roll out the fix.\n7. The Security Team will provide early disclosure of the vulnerability by emailing the [Sonobuoy Distributors](https://groups.google.com/g/projectsonobuoy-distributors) mailing list. Distributors can initially plan for the vulnerability patch ahead of the fix, and later can test the fix and provide feedback to the Sonobuoy team. See the section **Early Disclosure to Sonobuoy Distributors List** for details about how to join this mailing list. \n8. A public disclosure date is negotiated by the VMware SecurityTeam, the bug submitter, and the distributors list. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation or patch is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for distributor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it’s already publicly known) to a few weeks. For a critical vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect the report date for the public disclosure date to be on the order of 14 business days. The VMware Security Team holds the final say when setting a public disclosure date.\n9. Once the fix is confirmed, the Security Team will patch the vulnerability in the next patch or minor release, and backport a patch release into all earlier supported releases. Upon release of the patched version of Sonobuoy, we will follow the **Public Disclosure Process**.\n\n\n## Public Disclosure Process\n\nThe Security Team publishes a [public advisory](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/security/advisories) to the Sonobuoy community via GitHub. In most cases, additional communication via Slack, Twitter, mailing lists, blog and other channels will assist in educating Sonobuoy users and rolling out the patched release to affected users.\n\nThe Security Team will also publish any mitigating steps users can take until the fix can be applied to their Sonobuoy instances. Sonobuoy distributors will handle creating and publishing their own security advisories.\n\n\n\n\n## Mailing lists\n\n\n\n*   Use security@vmware.com to report security concerns to the VMware Security Team, who uses the list to privately discuss security issues and fixes prior to disclosure.\n*   Join the [Sonobuoy Distributors](https://groups.google.com/g/projectsonobuoy-distributors) mailing list for early private information and vulnerability disclosure. Early disclosure may include mitigating steps and additional information on security patch releases. See below for information on how Sonobuoy distributors or vendors can apply to join this list.\n\n\n## Early Disclosure to Sonobuoy Distributors List\n\nThe private list is intended to be used primarily to provide actionable information to multiple distributor projects at once. This list is not intended to inform individuals about security issues.\n\n\n## Membership Criteria\n\nTo be eligible to join the [Sonobuoy Distributors](https://groups.google.com/g/projectsonobuoy-distributors) mailing list, you should:\n\n\n\n1. Be an active distributor of Sonobuoy.\n2. Have a user base that is not limited to your own organization.\n3. Have a publicly verifiable track record up to the present day of fixing security issues.\n4. Not be a downstream or rebuild of another distributor.\n5. Be a participant and active contributor in the Sonobuoy community.\n6. Accept the Embargo Policy that is outlined below.\n7. Have someone who is already on the list vouch for the person requesting membership on behalf of your distribution.\n\n**The terms and conditions of the Embargo Policy apply to all members of this mailing list. A request for membership represents your acceptance to the terms and conditions of the Embargo Policy.**\n\n\n## Embargo Policy\n\nThe information that members receive on the Sonobuoy Distributors mailing list must not be made public, shared, or even hinted at anywhere beyond those who need to know within your specific team, unless you receive explicit approval to do so from the VMware Security Team. This remains true until the public disclosure date/time agreed upon by the list. Members of the list and others cannot use the information for any reason other than to get the issue fixed for your respective distribution's users.\n\nBefore you share any information from the list with members of your team who are required to fix the issue, these team members must agree to the same terms, and only be provided with information on a need-to-know basis.\n\nIn the unfortunate event that you share information beyond what is permitted by this policy, you must urgently inform the VMware Security Team (security@vmware.com) of exactly what information was leaked and to whom. If you continue to leak information and break the policy outlined here, you will be permanently removed from the list.\n\n\n\n\n## Requesting to Join\n\nSend new membership requests to projectsonobuoy-distributors@googlegroups.com. In the body of your request please specify how you qualify for membership and fulfill each criterion listed in the Membership Criteria section above.\n\n\n## Confidentiality, integrity and availability\n\nWe consider vulnerabilities leading to the compromise of data confidentiality, elevation of privilege, or integrity to be our highest priority concerns. Availability, in particular in areas relating to DoS and resource exhaustion, is also a serious security concern. The VMware Security Team takes all vulnerabilities, potential vulnerabilities, and suspected vulnerabilities seriously and will investigate them in an urgent and expeditious manner.\n\nNote that we do not currently consider the default settings for Sonobuoy to be secure-by-default. It is necessary for operators to explicitly configure settings, role based access control, and other resource related features in Sonobuoy to provide a hardened Sonobuoy environment. We will not act on any security disclosure that relates to a lack of safe defaults. Over time, we will work towards improved safe-by-default configuration, taking into account backwards compatibility.\n"
