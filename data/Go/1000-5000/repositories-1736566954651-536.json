However, we're thrilled to inform you that we've decided to take a bold step by embarking on a complete refactor, starting from scratch to enhance the overall development process. 🚀\n> \n> In parallel, we're actively laying down the roadmap for teler IDS v3. 📝<br>\n> What we can reveal at this point is that version 3 will leverage eBPF & [teler-waf](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler-waf) as its support, promising advanced features and capabilities. 🌟\n> \n> If you have feedback or suggestions regarding the features you'd like to see in teler IDS v3, kindly participate in our anonymous survey 👉 https://s.surveyplanet.com/8he6p7rq\n> \n> Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to innovate and enhance our intrusion detection system!

It is highly configurable and easy to integrate into existing Go applications.\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Why teler?](#why-teler)\n- [Demo](#demo)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Supporting Materials](#supporting-materials)\n- [Contributors](#contributors)\n  - [Resources](#resources)\n- [Pronunciation](#pronunciation)\n- [Changes](#changes)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Features\n\n* **Real-time**: Analyze logs and identify suspicious activity in real-time.\n\n* **Alerting**: teler provides alerting when a threat is detected, push notifications include Slack, Mattermost, Telegram and Discord.\n\n* **Monitoring**: We've our own metrics if you want to monitor threats easily, and we use Prometheus for that.\n\n* **Logging**: is also provided in file form or sends detected threats to the Zinc logs search engine.\n\n* **Latest resources**: Collections is continuously up-to-date.\n\n* **Minimal configuration**: You can just run it against your log file, write the log format and let\n  teler analyze the log and show you alerts!\n\n* **Flexible log formats**: teler allows any custom log format string! It all depends on how you write the log format in configuration file.\n\n* **Custom threat rules**: Want to reach a wider range of threats instead of engine-based _(default)_ rules? You can customize threat rules!\n\n* **Incremental log processing**: Need data persistence rather than [buffer stream](https://linux.die.net/man/1/stdbuf)?\n  teler has the ability to process logs incrementally through the on-disk persistence options.\n\n## Why teler?\n\nteler was designed to be a fast, terminal-based threat analyzer. Its core idea is to quickly analyze and hunt threats in real time!\n\n## Demo\n\nHere is a preview of `teler` with conditions of use as:\n\n| **Buffer-streams**  | **Incremental**   |\n|-------------------- |-----------------  |\n| <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/367616\" alt=\"teler\"><img src=\"https://asciinema.org/a/367616.svg\"></a> | <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/367610\" alt=\"teler\"><img src=\"https://asciinema.org/a/367610.svg\"></a> |\n\n## Documentation\n\nAll related documentation about installation, usage & configuration is on **[teler.app](https://teler.app)**.\n\n## Supporting Materials\n\n- [teler - Protect Your WebApp!](https://dw1.io/files/teler%20-%20Protect%20Your%20WebApp.pdf) Talks were brought to the **OWASP Jakarta: Virtual AppSec Indonesia 2020** event.\n- [Tutorial: Cyber Threat Hunting - Useful Threat Hunting Tools (Part One)](https://youtu.be/0m54WOXO6Gc), Semi Yulianto gave a brief explanation and how to use **teler** in the video.\n- [Empowering Teler HTTP Intrusion Detection as WAF with Fail2ban](https://link.medium.com/OXVZIMkZEeb).\n- [Detecting web attacks using Wazuh and teler](https://wazuh.com/blog/detecting-web-attacks-using-wazuh-and-teler/), integrate teler with a unified XDR and SIEM platform, Wazuh.\n\n## Contributors\n\n[![contributions](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/kitabisa/teler/issues)\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
