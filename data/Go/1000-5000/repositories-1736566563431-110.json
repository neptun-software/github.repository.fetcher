Custom channels with full API URL support\n4. [Suno API](https://github.com/Suno-API/Suno-API) interface, [Integration Guide](Suno.md)\n5. Rerank models, supporting [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/) and [Jina](https://jina.ai/), [Integration Guide](Rerank.md)\n6. Dify\n\nYou can add custom models gpt-4-gizmo-* in channels. These are third-party models and cannot be called with official OpenAI keys.\n\n## Additional Configurations Beyond One API\n- `GENERATE_DEFAULT_TOKEN`: Generate initial token for new users, default `false`\n- `STREAMING_TIMEOUT`: Set streaming response timeout, default 60 seconds\n- `DIFY_DEBUG`: Output workflow and node info to client for Dify channel, default `true`\n- `FORCE_STREAM_OPTION`: Override client stream_options parameter, default `true`\n- `GET_MEDIA_TOKEN`: Calculate image tokens, default `true`\n- `GET_MEDIA_TOKEN_NOT_STREAM`: Calculate image tokens in non-stream mode, default `true`\n- `UPDATE_TASK`: Update async tasks (Midjourney, Suno), default `true`\n- `GEMINI_MODEL_MAP`: Specify Gemini model versions (v1/v1beta), format: \"model:version\", comma-separated\n- `COHERE_SAFETY_SETTING`: Cohere model [safety settings](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/safety-modes#overview), options: `NONE`, `CONTEXTUAL`, `STRICT`, default `NONE`\n- `GEMINI_VISION_MAX_IMAGE_NUM`: Gemini model maximum image number, default `16`, set to `-1` to disable\n- `MAX_FILE_DOWNLOAD_MB`: Maximum file download size in MB, default `20`\n- `CRYPTO_SECRET`: Encryption key for encrypting database content\n\n## Deployment\n> [!TIP]\n> Latest Docker image: `calciumion/new-api:latest`  \n> Default account: root, password: 123456  \n> Update command:\n> ```\n> docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower -cR\n> ```\n\n### Multi-Server Deployment\n- Must set `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable, otherwise login state will not be consistent across multiple servers.\n- If using a public Redis, must set `CRYPTO_SECRET` environment variable, otherwise Redis content will not be able to be obtained in multi-server deployment.\n\n### Requirements\n- Local database (default): SQLite (Docker deployment must mount `/data` directory)\n- Remote database: MySQL >= 5.7.8, PgSQL >= 9.6\n\n### Docker Deployment\n### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)\n```shell\n# Clone project\ngit clone https://github.com/Calcium-Ion/new-api.git\ncd new-api\n# Edit docker-compose.yml as needed\n# Start\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n### Direct Docker Image Usage\n```shell\n# SQLite deployment:\ndocker run --name new-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data calciumion/new-api:latest\n# MySQL deployment (add -e SQL_DSN=\"root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi\"), modify database connection parameters as needed\n# Example:\ndocker run --name new-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e SQL_DSN=\"root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi\" -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data calciumion/new-api:latest\n```\n\n## Channel Retry\nChannel retry is implemented, configurable in `Settings->Operation Settings->General Settings`. **Cache recommended**.  \nFirst retry uses same priority, second retry uses next priority, and so on.\n\n### Cache Configuration\n1. `REDIS_CONN_STRING`: Use Redis as cache\n    + Example: `REDIS_CONN_STRING=redis://default:redispw@localhost:49153`\n2. `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED`: Enable memory cache, default `false`\n    + Example: `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED=true`\n\n### Why Some Errors Don't Retry\nError codes 400, 504, 524 won't retry\n### To Enable Retry for 400\nIn `Channel->Edit`, set `Status Code Override` to:\n```json\n{\n  \"400\": \"500\"\n}\n```\n\n## Integration Guides\n- [Midjourney Integration](Midjourney.md)\n- [Suno Integration](Suno.md)\n\n## Related Projects\n- [One API](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api): Original project\n- [Midjourney-Proxy](https://github.com/novicezk/midjourney-proxy): Midjourney interface support\n- [chatnio](https://github.com/Deeptrain-Community/chatnio): Next-gen AI B/C solution\n- [neko-api-key-tool](https://github.com/Calcium-Ion/neko-api-key-tool): Query usage quota by key\n\n## 🌟 Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=Calcium-Ion/new-api&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#Calcium-Ion/new-api&Date)"

Rerank模型，目前支持[Cohere](https://cohere.ai/)和[Jina](https://jina.ai/)，[对接文档](Rerank.md)\n6. Dify\n\n您可以在渠道中添加自定义模型gpt-4-gizmo-*，此模型并非OpenAI官方模型，而是第三方模型，使用官方key无法调用。\n\n## 比原版One API多出的配置\n- `GENERATE_DEFAULT_TOKEN`：是否为新注册用户生成初始令牌，默认为 `false`。\n- `STREAMING_TIMEOUT`：设置流式一次回复的超时时间，默认为 60 秒。\n- `DIFY_DEBUG`：设置 Dify 渠道是否输出工作流和节点信息到客户端，默认为 `true`。\n- `FORCE_STREAM_OPTION`：是否覆盖客户端stream_options参数，请求上游返回流模式usage，默认为 `true`，建议开启，不影响客户端传入stream_options参数返回结果。\n- `GET_MEDIA_TOKEN`：是否统计图片token，默认为 `true`，关闭后将不再在本地计算图片token，可能会导致和上游计费不同，此项覆盖 `GET_MEDIA_TOKEN_NOT_STREAM` 选项作用。\n- `GET_MEDIA_TOKEN_NOT_STREAM`：是否在非流（`stream=false`）情况下统计图片token，默认为 `true`。\n- `UPDATE_TASK`：是否更新异步任务（Midjourney、Suno），默认为 `true`，关闭后将不会更新任务进度。\n- `GEMINI_MODEL_MAP`：Gemini模型指定版本(v1/v1beta)，使用“模型:版本”指定，\",\"分隔，例如：-e GEMINI_MODEL_MAP=\"gemini-1.5-pro-latest:v1beta,gemini-1.5-pro-001:v1beta\"，为空则使用默认配置(v1beta)\n- `COHERE_SAFETY_SETTING`：Cohere模型[安全设置](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/safety-modes#overview)，可选值为 `NONE`, `CONTEXTUAL`，`STRICT`，默认为 `NONE`。\n- `GEMINI_VISION_MAX_IMAGE_NUM`：Gemini模型最大图片数量，默认为 `16`，设置为 `-1` 则不限制。\n- `MAX_FILE_DOWNLOAD_MB`: 最大文件下载大小，单位 MB，默认为 `20`。\n- `CRYPTO_SECRET`：加密密钥，用于加密数据库内容。\n## 部署\n> [!TIP]\n> 最新版Docker镜像：`calciumion/new-api:latest`  \n> 默认账号root 密码123456  \n> 更新指令：\n> ```\n> docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower -cR\n> ```\n\n### 多机部署\n- 必须设置环境变量 `SESSION_SECRET`，否则会导致多机部署时登录状态不一致。\n- 如果公用Redis，必须设置 `CRYPTO_SECRET`，否则会导致多机部署时Redis内容无法获取。\n\n### 部署要求\n- 本地数据库（默认）：SQLite（Docker 部署默认使用 SQLite，必须挂载 `/data` 目录到宿主机）\n- 远程数据库：MySQL 版本 >= 5.7.8，PgSQL 版本 >= 9.6\n\n### 使用宝塔面板Docker功能部署\n安装宝塔面板 (**9.2.0版本**及以上)，前往 [宝塔面板](https://www.bt.cn/new/download.html) 官网，选择正式版的脚本下载安装  \n安装后登录宝塔面板，在菜单栏中点击 Docker ，首次进入会提示安装 Docker 服务，点击立即安装，按提示完成安装  \n安装完成后在应用商店中找到 **New-API** ，点击安装，配置基本选项 即可完成安装  \n[图文教程](BT.md)\n\n### 基于 Docker 进行部署\n### 使用 Docker Compose 部署（推荐）\n```shell\n# 下载项目\ngit clone https://github.com/Calcium-Ion/new-api.git\ncd new-api\n# 按需编辑 docker-compose.yml\n# 启动\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n### 直接使用 Docker 镜像\n```shell\n# 使用 SQLite 的部署命令：\ndocker run --name new-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data calciumion/new-api:latest\n# 使用 MySQL 的部署命令，在上面的基础上添加 `-e SQL_DSN=\"root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi\"`，请自行修改数据库连接参数。\n# 例如：\ndocker run --name new-api -d --restart always -p 3000:3000 -e SQL_DSN=\"root:123456@tcp(localhost:3306)/oneapi\" -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai -v /home/ubuntu/data/new-api:/data calciumion/new-api:latest\n```\n\n## 渠道重试\n渠道重试功能已经实现，可以在`设置->运营设置->通用设置`设置重试次数，**建议开启缓存**功能。  \n如果开启了重试功能，第一次重试使用同优先级，第二次重试使用下一个优先级，以此类推。\n### 缓存设置方法\n1. `REDIS_CONN_STRING`：设置之后将使用 Redis 作为缓存使用。\n    + 例子：`REDIS_CONN_STRING=redis://default:redispw@localhost:49153`\n2. `MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED`：启用内存缓存（如果设置了`REDIS_CONN_STRING`，则无需手动设置），会导致用户额度的更新存在一定的延迟，可选值为 `true` 和 `false`，未设置则默认为 `false`。\n    + 例子：`MEMORY_CACHE_ENABLED=true`\n### 为什么有的时候没有重试\n这些错误码不会重试：400，504，524\n### 我想让400也重试\n在`渠道->编辑`中，将`状态码复写`改为\n```json\n{\n  \"400\": \"500\"\n}\n```\n可以实现400错误转为500错误，从而重试\n\n## Midjourney接口设置文档\n[对接文档](Midjourney.md)\n\n## Suno接口设置文档\n[对接文档](Suno.md)\n\n## 界面截图\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0dcd349-5df8-4dc8-9acf-ca272b239919)\n\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d0f7e1-729c-43e2-ac7c-2cb73b0afc8e)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29f81de5-33fc-4fc5-a5ff-f9b54b653c7c)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fa53e18-d2c5-477a-9b26-b86e44c71e35)\n\n## 交流群\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ca0bc82-e057-4230-a28d-9f198fa022e3\" width=\"200\">\n\n## 相关项目\n- [One API](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api)：原版项目\n- [Midjourney-Proxy](https://github.com/novicezk/midjourney-proxy)：Midjourney接口支持\n- [chatnio](https://github.com/Deeptrain-Community/chatnio)：下一代 AI 一站式 B/C 端解决方案\n- [neko-api-key-tool](https://github.com/Calcium-Ion/neko-api-key-tool)：用key查询使用额度\n\n其他基于New API的项目：\n- [new-api-horizon](https://github.com/Calcium-Ion/new-api-horizon)：New API高性能优化版，并支持Claude格式\n- [VoAPI](https://github.com/VoAPI/VoAPI)：基于New API的闭源项目\n\n## 🌟 Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=Calcium-Ion/new-api&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#Calcium-Ion/new-api&Date)\n"
