Helps debugging crashes and deadlocks in heavily parallelized\nprocess.\n\n[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/stack)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/stack)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/maruel/panicparse/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=izj1cLjUi3)](https://codecov.io/gh/maruel/panicparse)\n[![go-recipes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikolaydubina/go-recipes/main/badge.svg?raw=true)](https://github.com/nikolaydubina/go-recipes#-pretty-print-panic-messages)\n\n\npanicparse helps make sense of Go crash dumps:\n\n![Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/maruel/panicparse/parse.gif \"Screencast\")\n\n\n## Features\n\n   * Race detector support, e.g. it can parse output produced by `go test -race`\n   * HTML export.\n   * Easy to use as an [HTTP Handler\n     middleware](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/stack#example-package-HttpHandlerMiddleware).\n   * High performance parsing.\n   * [HTTP web server](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/stack/webstack#SnapshotHandler)\n     that serves a very tight and swell snapshot of your goroutines, much more\n     readable than [net/http/pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof).\n   * &gt;50% more compact output than original stack dump yet more readable.\n   * Deduplicates redundant goroutine stacks. Useful for large server crashes.\n   * Arguments as pointer IDs instead of raw pointer values.\n   * Pushes stdlib-only stacks at the bottom to help focus on important code.\n   * Parses the source files if available to augment the output.\n   * Works on any platform supported by Go, including Windows, macOS, linux.\n   * Full go module support.\n   * Requires >=go1.17. Use v2.3.1 for older Go versions.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n    go install github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/cmd/pp@latest\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Piping a stack trace from another process\n\n#### TL;DR\n\n   * Ubuntu (bash v4 or zsh): `|&`\n   * macOS, [install bash 4+](README.md#updating-bash-on-macos), then: `|&`\n   * Windows _or_ macOS with stock bash v3: `2>&1 |`\n   * [Fish](http://fishshell.com/) shell: `&|`\n\n\n#### Longer version\n\n`pp` streams its stdin to stdout as long as it doesn't detect any panic.\n`panic()` and Go's native deadlock detector [print to\nstderr](https://golang.org/src/runtime/panic1.go) via the native [`print()`\nfunction](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#print).\n\n\n**Bash v4** or **zsh**: `|&` tells the shell to redirect stderr to stdout,\nit's an alias for `2>&1 |` ([bash\nv4](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Pipelines),\n[zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Shell-Grammar.html#Simple-Commands-_0026-Pipelines)):\n\n    go test -v |&pp\n\n\n**Windows or macOS native bash** [(which is\n3.2.57)](http://meta.ath0.com/2012/02/05/apples-great-gpl-purge/): They don't\nhave this shortcut, so use the long form:\n\n    go test -v 2>&1 | pp\n\n\n**Fish**: `&|` redirects stderr and stdout. It's an alias for `2>&1 |`\n([fish piping](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#piping)):\n\n    go test -v &| pp\n\n\n**PowerShell**: [It has broken `2>&1` redirection](https://connect.microsoft.com/PowerShell/feedback/details/765551/in-powershell-v3-you-cant-redirect-stderr-to-stdout-without-generating-error-records). The workaround is to shell out to cmd.exe. :(\n\n\n### Investigate deadlock\n\nOn POSIX, use `Ctrl-\\` to send SIGQUIT to your process, `pp` will ignore\nthe signal and will parse the stack trace.\n\n\n### Parsing from a file\n\nTo dump to a file then parse, pass the file path of a stack trace\n\n    go test 2> stack.txt\n    pp stack.txt\n\n\n## Tips\n\n### Disable inlining\n\nThe Go toolchain inlines functions when it can. This causes traces to be less\ninformative. Optimization also interfere with traces. You can use the following\nto help diagnosing issues:\n\n    go install -gcflags '-N -l' path/to/foo\n    foo |& pp\n\nor\n\n    go test -gcflags '-N -l' ./... |& pp\n\n\nRun `go tool compile -help` to get the full list of valid values for -gcflags.\n\n\n### GOTRACEBACK\n\nBy default, [`GOTRACEBACK`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/) defaults to\n`single`, which means that a panic will only return the current goroutine trace\nalone. To get all goroutines trace and not just the crashing one, set the\nenvironment variable:\n\n    export GOTRACEBACK=all\n\nor `set GOTRACEBACK=all` on Windows. Probably worth to put it in your `.bashrc`.\n\n\n### Updating bash on macOS\n\nInstall bash v4+ on macOS via [homebrew](http://brew.sh) or\n[macports](https://www.macports.org/). Your future self will appreciate having\ndone that.\n\n\n### If you have `/usr/bin/pp` installed\n\nIf you try `pp` for the first time and you get:\n\n    Creating tables and indexes...\n    Done.\n\nand/or\n\n    /usr/bin/pp5.18: No input files specified\n\nyou may be running the _Perl PAR Packager_ instead of panicparse.\n\nYou have two choices, either you put `$GOPATH/bin` at the beginning of `$PATH`\nor use long name `panicparse` with:\n\n    go install github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2@latest\n\nthen using `panicparse` instead of `pp`:\n\n    go test 2> panicparse\n\nHint: You may also use shell aliases\n\n    alias gp=panicparse\n    go test 2> gp\n\n    alias p=panicparse\n    go test 2> p\n\n\n### webstack in action\n\nThe\n[webstack.SnapshotHandler](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/stack/webstack#SnapshotHandler)\nhttp.Handler enables glancing at at a snapshot of your process trivially:\n\n![Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/maruel/panicparse/panicparse_webstack.gif \"Screencast\")\n\n\n## Authors\n\n`panicparse` was created with ❤️️ and passion by [Marc-Antoine\nRuel](https://github.com/maruel) and\n[friends](https://github.com/maruel/panicparse/graphs/contributors).\n"
