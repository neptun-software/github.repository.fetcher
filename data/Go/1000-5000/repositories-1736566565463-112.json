We have a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgSDcTyysRc) to help you get started, and you can always ask us for help in the `#athens` channel in the [gopher slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/). We'll give you whatever guidance you need. Another great resource for first time contributors can be found [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md).\n\n## Claiming an issue\nIf you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please just post a comment saying that you want to work on it. Something like \"I want to work on this\" is fine.\n\n## Verify your work\nRun `make verify test-unit test-e2e` to run all the same validations that our CI process runs, such\nas checking that the standard go formatting is applied, linting, etc.\n\n## Setup your dev environment\n\nRun `make setup-dev-env` to install local developer tools and run necessary\nservices, such as mongodb, for the end-to-end tests.\n\n## Unit Tests\nFor further details see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#L84)\n\n## End-to-End Tests\nEnd-to-End tests (e2e) are tests from the user perspective that validate that\neverything works when running real live servers, and using `go` with GOPROXY set.\n\nRun `make test-e2e` to run the end-to-end tests.\n\nThe first time you run the tests,\nyou must run `make setup-dev-env` first, otherwise you will see errors like the one below:\n\n```\nerror connecting to storage (no reachable servers)\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAfter you get your code working, submit a Pull Request (PR) following \n[Github's PR model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).\n\nIf you're interested, take a look at [REVIEWS.md](REVIEWS.md) to learn how\nyour PR will be reviewed and how you can help get it merged.\n"

          "content": "# Development Guide for Athens\n\nThe proxy is written in idiomatic Go and uses standard tools. If you know Go, you'll be able to read the code and run the server.\n\nAthens uses [Go Modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more) for dependency management. You will need Go [v1.11](https://golang.org/dl) or later to get started on Athens.\n\nSee our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for tips on how to submit a pull request when you are ready.\n\n**All the instructions in this document assume that you have checked out the code to your local machine.**\n\nIf you haven't done that, please do with the below command before you proceed:\n\n```console\n$ git clone https://github.com/gomods/athens.git\n```\n\n### Go version\n\nAthens is developed on Go 1.11+.\n\nTo point Athens to a different version of Go set the following environment variable:\n\n```console\nGO_BINARY_PATH=go1.11.X\n# or whichever binary you want to use with athens\n```\n\n# Run the Proxy\n\nWe provide four ways to run the proxy on your local machine:\n\n1. Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (_we suggest this one if you're getting started_)\n2. Natively on your host as a service (only SystemD is currently supported)\n3. Natively on your host as a simple binary\n4. Using [Sail](https://sail.dev)\n\nSee below for instructions for each option!\n\n## Run Using Docker\n\nAs we said above, we suggest that you use this approach because it simulates a more realistic Athens deployment. This technique does the following, completely inside containers:\n\n1. Builds Athens from scratch\n2. Starts up [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)\n3. Configures Athens to use MongoDB for its storage and Jaeger for its distributed tracing\n4. Runs Athens\n\nYou'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed. Once you do, run the below command to set everything up:\n\n```console\n$ make run-docker\n```\n\nYou should see some output that look like this:\n\n```console\ndocker-compose -p athensdockerdev up -d dev\nCreating network \"athensdockerdev_default\" with the default driver\nCreating athensdockerdev_jaeger_1 ... done\nCreating athensdockerdev_minio_1  ... done\nCreating athensdockerdev_mongo_1  ... done\nCreating athensdockerdev_dev_1    ... done\n```\n\nAfter that runs, Athens should be up and running and serving on port 3000. To test it out, run this command:\n\n```console\n$ curl localhost:3000\n```\n\n... and you should see the standard Athens response:\n\n```console\n\"Welcome to The Athens Proxy\"\n```\n\nWhen you're ready to stop Athens and all its dependencies, run this command:\n\n```console\n$ make run-docker-teardown\n```\n\n## Run Natively on Your Host as a Service\n\nThere are many service execution environments. On Linux, two important ones are SystemD and SysV, but at the moment only SystemD is supported; others may follow soon. For other systems, please see the next section. \n\n### SystemD on Linux\n\nIf you're inside GOPATH, make sure `GO111MODULE=on`, if you're outside GOPATH, then Go Modules are on by default.\n\nThe Makefile builds the necessary `athens` binary. Then a script sets up the service for you.\n\n```console\n$ make athens\n$ sudo ./scripts/systemd.sh install\n```\n\nAfter the server starts, you can manage it as usual via `systemctl`, e.g.:\n\n```console\nsudo systemctl status athens\n```\nwhich is the same as\n\n```console\n$ sudo ./scripts/systemd.sh status\n```\n\nThe `systemd.sh` script also has a `remove` option to uninstall the service.\n\nSystemD allows logs to be collected and inspected; more information is in \n[this tutorial by Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs), amongst others. So tailing the logs can be done like this:\n\n```console\n$ sudo journalctl -u athens --since today --follow\n```\n\n## Run Natively on Your Host\n\nIf you're inside GOPATH, make sure `GO111MODULE=on`, if you're outside GOPATH, then Go Modules are on by default.\n\nThe main package is inside `cmd/proxy` and is run like any go project as follows:\n\n```console\n$ cd cmd/proxy\n$ go build\n$ ./proxy\n```\n\nAfter the server starts, you'll see some console output like:\n\n```console\nStarting application at 127.0.0.1:3000\n```\n\n## Run Using Sail\n\nFollow instructions at [sail.dev](https://sail.dev) to setup the sail CLI. Then simply run:\n\n```\nsail run gomods/athens\n```\n\nThe command will automatically clone the athens repo and give you a local URL that you can use to open an editor and development environment directly in your browser.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n# Services that Athens Needs\n\nDepending on its configuration, Athens may rely on several external services (i.e. databases, etc...) to function properly. We use [Docker](http://docker.com/) images to configure and run those services. **However, Athens does not require any of these external services by default**. For example, the default storage driver is memory, but you can opt-in to using the `fs` driver. Neither would require any external service dependencies.\n\nBut if you'd like to test out Athens against a different storage backend like MongoDB, Minio, or a cloud blob storage system, this section is for you.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Docker, that's ok. We've tried to make it easy to get up and running with the below steps.\n\n1. [Download and install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (docker-compose is a tool for easily starting and stopping lots of services at once)\n2. Run `make dev` from the root of this repository\n\nThat's it! After the `make dev` command is done, everything will be up and running and you can move on to the next step.\n\nIf you want to stop everything at any time, run `make down`.\n\n> Note: `make dev` only runs the minimum dependencies needed for things to work. If you'd like to run all the possible dependencies, run `make alldeps`. Keep in mind, though, that `make alldeps` does not start up Athens, but **only** its dependencies.\n> All the services that get started by `make alldeps` are also available in the `docker-compose.yml` file, so if you're familiar with Docker Compose, you can also start up services as you need.\n\n# Run unit tests\n\nThere are two methods for running unit tests:\n\n## Completely In Containers\n\nThis method uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to set up and run all the unit tests completely inside Docker containers.\n\n**We highly recommend you use this approach to run unit tests on your local machine.**\n\nIt's nice because:\n\n- You don't have to set up anything in advance or clean anything up\n- It's completely isolated\n- All you need is to have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed\n\nTo run unit tests in this manner, use this command:\n\n```console\nmake test-unit-docker\n```\n\n## On the Host\n\nThis method uses Docker Compose to set up all the dependencies of the unit tests (databases, etc...), but runs the unit tests directly on your host, not in a Docker container. This is a nice approach because you can keep all the dependency services running at all times, and you can run the actual unit tests very quickly.\n\nTo run unit tests in this manner, first run this command to set up all the dependencies:\n\n```console\nmake alldeps\n```\n\nThen run this to execute the unit tests themselves:\n\n```console\nmake test-unit\n```\n\nAnd when you're done with unit tests and want to clean up all the dependencies, run this command:\n\n```console\nmake dev-teardown\n```\n\n# Run End to End Tests\n\nEnd to end tests ensure that the Athens server behaves as expected from the `go` CLI tool. These tests run exclusively inside Docker containers using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), so you'll have to have those dependencies installed. To run the tests, execute this command:\n\n```console\nmake test-e2e-docker\n```\n\nThis will create the e2e test containers, run the tests themselves, and then shut everything down.\n\n# Build the Docs\n\nTo get started with developing the docs we provide a docker image, which runs [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to render the docs. Using the docker image, we mount the `/docs` directory into the container. To get it up and running, from the project root run:\n\n```\nmake docs\ndocker run -it --rm \\\n        --name hugo-server \\\n        -p 1313:1313 \\\n        -v ${PWD}/docs:/src:cached \\\n        gomods/hugo\n```\n\nThen open [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/).\n\n# Linting\n\nIn our CI/CD pass, we use golangci-lint, so feel free to run it locally beforehand:\n\n```\nmake lint\n```\n\n# For People Doing a Release\n\nThis section is written primarily for maintainers, so we don't forget how to initiate and complete a release. If you're not a maintainer and you're curious how we release new versions of Athens, read on!\n\nTake a look at our [releases page](https://github.com/gomods/athens/releases). This is how we release official new builds of Athens. Almost all of the release process is automatic.\n\n## Notes about the release number\n\nBefore we continue, please be sure you're familiar with our release numbering scheme.\n\nWe follow the [semver](https://semver.org) convention for our release numbers. At the moment, we're not at `v1`, so release versions are `v0.x.y`. `x` is the `MINOR` number, and `y` is the `PATCH` number. You'll need to decide which one to update.\n\nIf there are significant new features in this release, choose to update `x` and set `y` to 0. If there are just bugfixes, just increment the `y` version number.\n\n## Code freeze\n\nThe first step to a release is a code freeze. This is 1-2 weeks (depending on the features and bugfixes we intend to release) during which we don't merge anything but critical bugfixes to the `main` branch. The code in `main` is essentially a release candidate (we don't cut a new branch for RC's at the moment) to test.\n\n>If you are doing a patch release, you do not need to do a code freeze.\n\n## Release branch\n\nYou'll be creating a new branch that represents the code that will be released. It always looks like `release-v0.x.y`. The `v0.x.y` represents the semver version number.\n\n>Reminder, the `x` and `y` make up the semver number. `x` is the `MINOR` and `y` is the `PATCH`\n\nYou'll need to have permissions to create a new branch in origin, whether through the GitHub site or running `push origin release-v0.x.x`.\n\n### Minor releases\n\nIf you're doing a minor release, you'll be incrementing `x` and setting `y` to 0 in the branch name. For example, if the previous release was `v0.1.2`, the previous release branch will be `release-v0.1.2`. Your new version will be `v0.2.0` and new release branch will be `release-v0.2.0`.\n\nCut minor release branches from the `main` branch.\n\n### Patch releases\n\nIf you're doing a patch release, you'll be incrementing only the `y` version number. In this case, the new version will be `v0.2.1` and new branch will be `release-v0.2.1`.\n\nCut patch release branches from the most recent release branch. Since these branches will only fix bugs, you'll need to find the commits from `main` that have the fixes in them and cherry pick them into the new patch release branch. For example:\n\n```console\n$ git checkout -b release-v0.2.1 upstream/release-v0.2.0\n$ git cherry-pick <commit from main>\n....\n```\n\n### Updating the helm chart\nsee https://github.com/gomods/athens-charts\n\n## Creating the new release in GitHub\n\nGo to the [create new release page](https://github.com/gomods/athens/releases/new) and draft a new release. See below for what data to put into the fields you see:\n\n- **Tag version** - This should be the same `v0.x.y` number you put into the release branch. Make sure this tag starts with `v` and that the tag target is the proper release branch.\n- **Release Title** - Make sure the title is prefixed by the release number including the `v`. If you want to write something creative in the rest of the title, go for it!\n- **Describe this release** - Make sure to write what features this release includes, and any notable bugfixes. Also, thank all the folks who contributed to the release. You can find that information in a link that looks like this: `https://github.com/gomods/athens/compare/$PREVIOUS_TAG...release-$CURRENT_TAG`. Substitute `$PREVIOUS_TAG` for the last semver and `$CURRENT_TAG` to the version in the new release branch\n\nWhen you're done, press the \"Publish Release\" button. After you do, our Github Actions job will do almost everything.\n\nMake sure the Github Actions CI/CD job finished, and check in Docker Hub to make sure the new release showed up in the [tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/gomods/athens/tags) section.\n\n## Finishing up\n\nThe Github Actions job will do everything except:\n\n- Tweet out about the new release\n- Update the helm chart\n\nIf you are a core maintainer and don't have access to the `@gomods` account, ask one of the maintainers to give you access. [Here](https://twitter.com/gomodsio/status/1240016379962691585) is an example showing the general format of these tweets. Obviously you should use your creativity here though!\n\nFinally, create a pull request from your new branch into the `main` branch. It will be reviewed and merged as soon as possible.\n"

Athens is an open source, enterprise ready implementation of the [Go Module proxy](https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-proxy) for the [Go Modules download API](https://docs.gomods.io/intro/protocol/).\n\nSee our documentation site [https://docs.gomods.io](https://docs.gomods.io) for more details on the project.\n\n**We are looking for people who would like to become core maintainers of this project. Please see [issue #1734](https://github.com/gomods/athens/issues/1734) for more details.**\n\n# Project Status\n\nDevelopment teams at several companies are using Athens in their everyday development workflows.\n\nThis means that they are running their own Athens servers, hooking them up to their own storage backends (see [here](https://docs.gomods.io/configuration/storage/) for the list of storage backends that Athens supports), and configuring their local Go development environments to use that Athens server.\n\nWe encourage you to [try it out](https://docs.gomods.io/install/), consider using it in your development workflow, and letting us know if you are using it by adding a comment to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/gomods/athens/issues/1323).\n\n# More Details Please!\n\nThe proxy implements the [Go modules download protocol](https://docs.gomods.io/intro/protocol/).\n\nAthens proxies are highly configurable, so they can work for lots of different deployments. For example, proxies support a wide variety of storage drivers including:\n\n- Cloud blob storage services\n- MongoDB\n- Content distribution networks (CDNs)\n- Shared disk\n- In-memory\n\n# Development\n\nSee [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for details on how to set up your development environment and start contributing code.\n\nSpeaking of contributing, read on!\n\n# Contributing\n\nIf you use Athens for your development workflow, we hope that you'll consider contributing back to the project. Athens is widely used and has plenty of interesting work to do, from technical challenges to technical documentation to release management. We have a wonderful community that we would love you to be a part of. [Absolutely everyone is welcome](https://arschles.com/blog/absolutely-everybody/).\n\nThe quickest way to get involved is by [filing issues](https://github.com/gomods/athens/issues/new/choose) if you find bugs or find that you need Athens to do something it doesn't.\n\nIf you'd like to help us tackle some of the technical / code challenges and you're familiar with the GitHub contribution process, you'll probably be familiar with our process for contributions. You can optionally find or submit an issue, and then submit a pull request (PR) to fix that issue. See [here](https://docs.gomods.io/contributing/) for more of the project-specific details.\n\n>If you're not familiar with the standard GitHub contribution process, which Athens mostly follows, please see [this section of our documentation](https://docs.gomods.io/contributing/new/) to learn how to contribute. You can also take advantage of [@bketelsen](https://github.com/bketelsen)'s [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgSDcTyysRc) on how to contribute code. The information in these documents and videos will help you not only with this project, but can also help you contribute to many other projects on GitHub.\n\nIf you decide to contribute but aren't sure what to work on, we have a well maintained [list of good first issues](https://github.com/gomods/athens/contribute) that you should look at. If you find one that you would like to work on, please post a comment saying \"I want to work on this\", and then it's all yours to begin working on.\n\n>We do recommend that you choose one of the issues on the above list, but you may also consider a different one from our [entire list](https://github.com/gomods/athens/issues). Many of the issues on that list are more complex and challenging.\n\nBefore you do start getting involved or contributing, we want to let you know that we follow a general [philosophy](./PHILOSOPHY.md) in how we work together, and we'd really appreciate you getting familiar with it before you start.\n\nIt's not too long and it's ok for you to \"skim\" it (or even just read the first two sections :smile:), just as long as you understand the spirit of who we are and how we work.\n\n# Getting Involved Without Contributing Pull Requests or Issues\n\nIf you're not ready to contribute code yet, there are plenty of other great ways to get involved:\n\n- Come talk to us in the `#athens` channel in the [Gophers slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gophers/shared_invite/zt-2x2fraaj5-Gai4CThbNTLvXKOxhbrDOQ). We’re a really friendly group, so come say hi and join us! Ping me (`@arschles` on slack) in the channel and I’ll give you the lowdown\n- Get familiar with the technology. There's lots to read about. Here are some places to start:\n    - [Gentle Introduction to the Project](https://medium.com/@arschles/project-athens-c80606497ce1) - the basics of why we started this project\n    - [The Download Protocol](https://medium.com/@arschles/project-athens-the-download-protocol-2b346926a818) - the core API that the proxy implements and the `go` CLI uses to download packages\n    - [Proxy Design](https://docs.gomods.io/design/proxy/) - what the proxy is and how it works\n    - [Go modules wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) - context and details on how Go dependency management works in general\n    - [\"Go and Versioning\"](https://research.swtch.com/vgo) - long articles on Go dependency management details, internals, etc...\n\n# Built on the Shoulders of Giants\n\nThe Athens project would not be possible without the amazing projects it builds on. Please see [SHOULDERS.md](./SHOULDERS.md) to see a list of them.\n\n# Coding Guidelines\n\nWe all strive to write nice and readable code which can be understood by every person of the team. To achieve that we follow principles described in Brian's talk `Code like the Go team`.\n\n- [Printed version](https://www.brianketelsen.com/slides/gcru18-best/#1)\n- [Gophercon RU talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzTcsI6tn-0)\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nThis project follows the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) (English version [here](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)) code of conduct.\n\nIf you have concerns, notice a code of conduct violation, or otherwise would like to talk about something\nrelated to this code of conduct, please reach out `@arschles` on the [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/).\n\n---\n\nAthens banner attributed to Golda Manuel\n"

Overall, we think it's a pretty intuitive system\nwith a nice user interface. Hopefully you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly. If you\ndon't, no worries - ask us in the `#athens` room on the [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)!\n\nWhen you're doing a review on a PR, you'll make comments that nobody but you can see until you\nsubmit the review. That feature can be nice because you might want to change things as you\nlearn more about the code, etc... \n\nIt can also be confusing if you forget to submit your review! Lots of us have forgotten to do \nthat :smile:.\n\nAnyway, when you're done with your review and satisfied with all your comments, you'll have \nthree options to submit your review:\n\n- Comment\n- Approve\n- Request Changes\n\nBelow, we'll explain when to use each of these options.\n\n## Request Changes\n\nWhen you decide to submit your review, please use `Request Changes` when you've posted\ncomments asking the author to make some changes, explain something, etc..., and you \nwant to block the PR from being merged until:\n\n- The author has a chance to read your comments and make changes, etc...\n- You have a chance to review again\n- You explicitly approve in your review\n\n## Comment\n\nWhen you decide to submit your review, please use `Comment` for feedback that you'd\nlike addressed but it's not crucial if it's not. This review type will allow another maintainer\nto merge the PR after your feedback has been addressed, without requiring you to \ncome back and manually re-review and approve the PR. In other words, you won't\nbe blocking the PR from being merged.\n\nConversely, if you are considering whether to merge a PR, please make sure that other \nreviewers' `Comment` reviews are addressed (e.g. the author has made requested changes, \nresponded to questions, etc...) before you merge.\n\n## Approve\n\nThis one is the easiest. When you decide to submit your review, please use `Approve` if everything\nlooks good. If nobody else has any `Request Changes` or `Comment` reviews \n(GitHub will show a red \"X\" near their name if they do), you can click the \"Squash and Merge\"\nbutton to merge their PR into the `main` branch!\n"

In other words, if the config file value is \n# GoBinaryEnvVars = [\"GOPROXY=direct\"]\n# And you pass the following env var: \n# ATHENS_GO_BINARY_ENV_VARS='GODEBUG=true'\n# Then the final value that the Go binary will receive is [\"GODEBUG=true\"] and NOT [\"GOPROXY=direct\", \"GODEBUG=true\"]\n# Therefore, whether you use the config file or the env var, make sure you have all the values you need there.\nGoBinaryEnvVars = [\"GOPROXY=direct\"]\n\n# GoGetWorkers specifies how many times you can concurrently\n# go mod download, this is so that low performance instances\n# can manage go get more sanely and not run out of disk or memory.\n# One way to think about is: the number of GoGetWorkers corresponds\n# directly to how many parallel \"git clones\" your underlying machine\n# can handle.\n# Env override: ATHENS_GOGET_WORKERS\nGoGetWorkers = 10\n\n# GoGetDir specifies the temporary directory that Athens\n# will use to fetch modules from VCS prior to persisting\n# them to a storage backend.
