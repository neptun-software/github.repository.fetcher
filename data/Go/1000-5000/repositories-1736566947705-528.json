          "content": "## OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) EULA Addendum\n\nfaasd is part of OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) and is subject to the [OpenFaaS CE EULA](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/EULA.md). Additional clauses apply to faasd only, to enable certain commercial usage for Individuals and within Small Business Environments.\n\nEnd User License Agreement (EULA) Addendum for faasd Licensed Software.\n\nThis addendum to the OpenFaaS Community Edition EULA applies specifically to the use of faasd. It governs the conditions under which faasd may be used within Small Business Environments and for Personal Use.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n1.1 Small Business Environment:\n\nA \"Small Business Environment\" is defined as any commercial entity with fewer than 50 employees and less than US $5,000,000 (or equivalent local currency) in annual revenue. Internal usage refers to faasd being used solely within the business for developing, testing, or deploying solutions for internal purposes or hosted services offered by the business, without distributing faasd itself to end clients or customers.\n\n1.2 Personal Use:\n\n\"Personal Use\" refers to the use of faasd by individuals for personal or commercial purposes, including hosting or running applications. This includes using faasd as part of a hosted solution (e.g., hosting functions or running a commercial application) but does not permit distributing faasd itself to clients or customers.\n\n2. License Grant for faasd\n\n2.1 Small Business Environment Use:\n\nfaasd may be used for limited commercial purposes within a Small Business Environment. This includes deploying faasd as part of a hosted solution or for internal usage (e.g., running functions or commercial applications for internal or customer-facing services), provided that faasd itself is not distributed, resold, or sublicensed to end clients or customers. The license covers internal use or as part of a hosted solution but restricts distributing faasd binaries or code to any third parties.\n\n2.2 Personal Use:\n\nfaasd may be used by individuals for personal projects or commercial purposes, including hosting solutions for their own commercial applications or functions. This includes using faasd as part of a hosted solution (e.g., running functions or a commercial application within faasd), provided that faasd itself is not distributed to end clients or customers as part of the solution.\n\n3. Restrictions on faasd Use\n\n3.1 No Resale or Redistribution:\n\nfaasd may not be resold, distributed, or provided as part of a product or service directly to end clients or customers, regardless of whether those entities meet the Small Business Environment criteria outlined above. This includes embedding faasd into a software or service that is distributed to other businesses or individuals.\n\n3.2 Non-transferability:\n\nThe rights to use faasd under this addendum are non-transferable. If the user or business does not meet the definition of a Small Business Environment or if Personal Use criteria do not apply, a separate commercial license must be obtained from OpenFaaS Ltd. If the entity meets the Small Business Environment or Personal Use criteria, no additional license is required.\n\n4. Compliance\n\n4.1 License Enforcement:\n\nOpenFaaS Ltd reserves the right to implement reasonable measures to verify compliance with this faasd EULA addendum. The Customer agrees to cooperate with any compliance verification efforts conducted by OpenFaaS Ltd.\n\n5. Termination of faasd License\n\nThis addendum and the license granted hereunder are effective upon installation and use of faasd. OpenFaaS Ltd reserves the right to terminate this license if any of the terms outlined in this addendum are violated. Upon termination, all copies of faasd must be deleted.\n\n6.

It runs on a single host with very modest requirements, making it fast and easy to manage. Under the hood it uses [containerd](https://containerd.io/) and [Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) along with the same core OpenFaaS components from the main project.\n\n![faasd logo](docs/media/social.png)\n\n## Use-cases and tutorials\n\nfaasd is just another way to run OpenFaaS, so many things you read in the docs or in blog posts will work the same way.\n\nVideos and overviews:\n\n* [Exploring of serverless use-cases from commercial and personal users (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI)\n* [Meet faasd. Look Ma’ No Kubernetes! (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnZJXI377ak)\n\nUse-cases and tutorials:\n\n* [Serverless Node.js that you can run anywhere](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/serverless-nodejs/)\n* [Simple Serverless with Golang Functions and Microservices](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/golang-serverless/)\n* [Build a Flask microservice with OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-flask/)\n* [Get started with Java 11 and Vert.x on Kubernetes with OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/get-started-with-java-openjdk11/)\n* [Deploy to faasd via GitHub Actions](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/openfaas-functions-with-github-actions/)\n* [Scrape and automate websites with Puppeteer](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/puppeteer-scraping/)\n\nAdditional resources:\n\n* The official handbook - [Serverless For Everyone Else](https://openfaas.gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else)\n* For reference: [OpenFaaS docs](https://docs.openfaas.com)\n* For use-cases and tutorials: [OpenFaaS blog](https://openfaas.com/blog/)\n* For self-paced learning: [OpenFaaS workshop](https://github.com/openfaas/workshop/)\n\n### About faasd\n\n* faasd is a single static Golang binary, which runs on Linux with systemd\n* uses the same core components and ecosystem of OpenFaaS\n* uses containerd for its runtime and CNI for networking\n* is multi-arch, so works on Intel `x86_64` and Arm out the box\n* runs stateful containers through its `docker-compose.yaml` file like Grafana, MongoDB, InfluxDB, or Postgres, etc\n\nMost importantly, it's easy to manage so you can set it up and leave it alone to run your functions.\n\n[![demo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPNQz00W4AEwDxM?format=jpg&name=medium)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX1tZoSXy8E)\n\n> Demo of faasd running asynchronous functions\n\nWatch the video: [faasd walk-through with cloud-init and Multipass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX1tZoSXy8E)\n\n### What does faasd deploy?\n\n* faasd - itself, and its [faas-provider](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-provider) for containerd - CRUD for functions and services, implements the OpenFaaS REST API\n* [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) - for monitoring of services, metrics, scaling and dashboards\n* [OpenFaaS CE Gateway](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/gateway) - the UI portal, CLI, and other OpenFaaS tooling can talk to this.\n* [OpenFaaS CE queue-worker for NATS Streaming](https://github.com/openfaas/nats-queue-worker) - run your invocations in the background without adding any code. See also: [asynchronous invocations](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/triggers/#async-nats-streaming)\n* [NATS](https://nats.io) for asynchronous processing and queues\n\n## Licensing & EULA for OpenFaaS (faasd)\n\nfaasd (which is a distribution of OpenFaaS) is licensed under the [OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) EULA](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/EULA.md), [additional clauses apply](EULA.md) to enable faasd to be used for Personal Use and within Small Business Environments.\n\nA separate OpenFaaS Standard license is available for commercial use-cases, which is required for certain commercial use.\n\n### When should you use faasd over OpenFaaS on Kubernetes?\n\nfaasd relies on industry-standard tools for running containers:\n\n* [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins)\n* [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd)\n* [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)\n\nYou can use the standard [faas-cli](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) along with pre-packaged functions from *the Function Store*, or build your own using any OpenFaaS template.\n\n* To deploy microservices and functions that you can update and monitor remotely\n* When you don't have the bandwidth to learn or manage Kubernetes\n* To deploy embedded apps in IoT and edge use-cases\n* To distribute applications to a customer or client\n* You have a cost sensitive project - run faasd on a 1GB VM for 5-10 USD / mo or on your Raspberry Pi\n* When you just need a few functions or microservices, without the cost of a cluster\n\nfaasd does not create the same maintenance burden you'll find with maintaining, upgrading, and securing a Kubernetes cluster. You can deploy it and walk away, in the worst case, just deploy a new VM and deploy your functions again.\n\nYou can learn more about supported OpenFaaS features in the [ROADMAP.md](/docs/ROADMAP.md)\n\n## Learning faasd\n\nYou can find various resources to learn about faasd for free, however the official handbook is the most comprehensive guide to getting started with faasd and OpenFaaS.\n\n[\"Serverless For Everyone Else\"](https://openfaas.gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else) is the official handbook and was written to contribute funds towards the upkeep and maintenance of the project.\n\n### The official handbook and docs for faasd\n\n<a href=\"https://openfaas.gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else\">\n<img src=\"https://www.alexellis.io/serverless.png\" width=\"40%\"></a>\n\nYou'll learn how to deploy code in any language, lift and shift Dockerfiles, run requests in queues, write background jobs and to integrate with databases. faasd packages the same code as OpenFaaS, so you get built-in metrics for your HTTP endpoints, a user-friendly CLI, pre-packaged functions and templates from the store and a UI.\n\nTopics include:\n\n* Should you deploy to a VPS or Raspberry Pi?\n* Deploying your server with bash, cloud-init or terraform\n* Using a private container registry\n* Finding functions in the store\n* Building your first function with Node.js\n* Using environment variables for configuration\n* Using secrets from functions, and enabling authentication tokens\n* Customising templates\n* Monitoring your functions with Grafana and Prometheus\n* Scheduling invocations and background jobs\n* Tuning timeouts, parallelism, running tasks in the background\n* Adding TLS to faasd and custom domains for functions\n* Self-hosting on your Raspberry Pi\n* Adding a database for storage with InfluxDB and Postgresql\n* Troubleshooting and logs\n* CI/CD with GitHub Actions and multi-arch\n* Taking things further, community and case-studies\n\nView sample pages, reviews and testimonials on Gumroad:\n\n[\"Serverless For Everyone Else\"](https://openfaas.gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else)\n\n### Deploy OpenFaaS Edge (commercial distribution of faasd)\n\nOpenFaaS Edge is a commercial distribution of faasd, with enhancements and additional features from OpenFaaS Pro. The [OpenFaaS Pro EULA applies](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/pro/EULA.md).\n\n* Upgraded Pro components from OpenFaaS Standard: Gateway, Cron Connector, JetStream Queue Worker and Classic Scale to Zero\n* Deploy up to 250 functions per installation\n* Configure private DNS servers\n* Airgap-friendly with installation bundled in an OCI image\n* Detailed RAM/CPU metrics for stateful containers, and functions, including Out Of Memory (OOM) events\n* Multiple namespace support\n\nThis version is intended for resale as part of a wider solution, and to be deployed both into industrial and on-premises environments.\n\nIndividual [GitHub Sponsors of OpenFaaS](https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas) (25 USD / mo and higher) can use OpenFaaS Edge for personal use.\n\nYou can install OpenFaaS Edge with the following script:\n\n```bash\ncurl -sLSf \\\n    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faasd/refs/heads/master/hack/install-edge.sh \\\n    -o install-edge.sh && \\\nchmod +x install-edge.sh\nsudo -E ./install-edge.sh\n```\n\n*For an offline installation*\n\nCopy the OCI bundle and the install-edge.sh script to the remote server.\n\nThen mirror the various images from docker-compose.yaml into your private registry, and update the references from i.e. `image: ghcr.io/openfaasltd/gateway` to the equivalents in your registry.\n\nIf your system is unable to install apt, yum, or pacman packages, due to limited network access, then set the `SKIP_OS` environment to 1. The list of packages is available in the `install_required_packages` section of the script.\n\n### Deploy faasd CE\n\nfaasd-ce supports 15 functions and needs a computer with a stable Internet connection to run. There are some restrictions on commercial use, but [individuals and certain small businesses can use it for free](EULA.md).\n\nThe easiest way to deploy faasd is with cloud-init, we give several examples below, and post IaaS platforms will accept \"user-data\" pasted into their UI, or via their API.\n\nFor trying it out on MacOS or Windows, we recommend using [multipass](https://multipass.run) to run faasd in a VM.\n\nIf you don't use cloud-init, or have already created your Linux server you can use the installation script as per below:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1\ncd faasd\n\n./hack/install.sh\n```\n\n> This approach also works for Raspberry Pi when using the 64-bit OS or Ubuntu 22.04 or higher.\n\nIt's recommended that you do not install Docker on the same host as faasd, since 1) they may both use different versions of containerd and 2) docker's networking rules can disrupt faasd's networking. When using faasd - make your faasd server a faasd server, and build container image on your laptop or in a CI pipeline.\n\n#### Deployment tutorials\n\n* [Use multipass on Windows, MacOS or Linux](/docs/MULTIPASS.md)\n* [Deploy to DigitalOcean with Terraform and TLS](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/)\n* [Deploy to any IaaS with cloud-init](https://blog.alexellis.io/deploy-serverless-faasd-with-cloud-init/)\n* [Deploy faasd to your Raspberry Pi](https://blog.alexellis.io/faasd-for-lightweight-serverless/)\n\nTerraform scripts:\n\n* [Provision faasd on DigitalOcean with Terraform](docs/bootstrap/README.md)\n* [Provision faasd with TLS on DigitalOcean with Terraform](docs/bootstrap/digitalocean-terraform/README.md)\n\n### Function and template store\n\nFor community functions see `faas-cli store --help`\n\nFor templates built by the community see: `faas-cli template store list`, you can also use the `dockerfile` template if you just want to migrate an existing service without the benefits of using a template.\n\n### Community support\n\nCommercial users and solo business owners should become OpenFaaS GitHub Sponsors to receive regular email updates on changes, tutorials and new features.\n\nIf you are learning faasd, or want to share your use-case, you can join the OpenFaaS Slack community.\n\n* [Become an OpenFaaS GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas/)\n* [Join the weekly Office Hours call](https://docs.openfaas.com/community/)\n\n### Backlog, features, design limitations and any known issues\n\nFor open backlog items, shipped features, design limitations and any known issues, see [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)\n\nWant to build a patch without setting up a complete development environment? See [docs/PATCHES.md](docs/PATCHES.md)\n\nAre you looking to hack on faasd? Follow the [developer instructions](docs/DEV.md) for a manual installation, or use the `hack/install.sh` script and pick up from there.\n"
