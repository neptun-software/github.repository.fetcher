          "content": "# Istio Brand Guidelines\n \nThe Istio trademark and logos (“Istio Trademarks”) are treated separately from the copyright or patent license grants contained in the Apache-licensed Istio repositories on GitHub. Any use of the Istio Trademarks other than those permitted in these guidelines must be approved in advance.\n\n## Purpose of the Brand Guidelines\n    \nTrademarks are used to identify and distinguish one source of goods or services from another, and to make it easier for a user to quickly tell who is behind a particular product or project. These guidelines exist to ensure that the Istio project can share its platform under open source licenses while making sure that the “Istio” brand is protected as a meaningful source identifier in a way that is consistent with trademark law.\n\n \n## Acceptable Uses\n\nGiven the open nature of Istio, you may use the Istio trademark to refer to the project without prior written permission. Examples of these acceptable references include the following:\n\n-   To refer to the Istio project itself\n    \n-   To refer to unmodified source code or other files shared by the Istio repositories on GitHub\n    \n-   To accurately identify that your design or implementation is based on or is for use with the Istio platform\n    \n-   To discuss the Istio project for educational or informational purposes\n    \n*Acceptable Examples:*\n\n-   “[Your Product/Offering] for Istio”\n    \n-   “[XYZ] Conference for Istio Users”\n    \n-   “Making [XYZ] better with Istio”\n    \n## Usage Guidelines\n\n-   The Istio name may not be used or registered in a manner that would cause confusion as to the Istio project’s affiliation or endorsement.\n    \n-   Don’t use the Istio name as part of your company name, product name, domain name, or social media profile.\n    \n-   Other than as permitted by these guidelines, the Istio name should not be combined with other trademarks, terms, or source identifiers.\n    \n-   Don't remove, distort or alter any element of the Istio Trademarks without permission.\n    \n-   Do not shorten, abbreviate, or change the spelling of the Istio name.\n    \n-   Do not change the color or design elements of the Istio logo, or combine the logo with any other text.\n    \n-   Community websites, social media accounts, or other community-organized properties or organizations should follow the naming convention \"[XYZ] for Istio Users\" or \"[XYZ] for Istio Contributors\".\n    \n-   The name \"Istio Working Group\" can only be used by approved working groups maintaining code in the Istio GitHub organization under Istio Project governance.\n    \n-   If you’re organizing a conference, training, or certification program, you can use the word Istio to refer to the technology that the event or program covers. However, Istio cannot be contained in the title name for your conference or program (such as IstioConf or Certified Istio Administrator) without further explanation. An example of an appropriate usage could be “XYZ Conference for Istio Users” or “XYZ Certification Program for Istio Users” with XYZ being your own brand name. Any related materials should also prominently disclaim any official affiliation with or endorsement by the Istio project.\n    \n-   Don’t use the Istio mark prominently on posters, brochures, signs, websites, or other marketing materials to promote your events, products or services without written permission from Istio Steering. \n    \n-   Don't use the Istio name or logo to indicate that your design or implementation is endorsed by, or a part of the Istio project without prior written permission.\n\n*Unacceptable Examples:*\n\n-   “[Company] Istio [Product/Offering]”\n    \n-   “[XYZ]Istio”\n    \n-   “Istio Day”\n\nThe Istio Steering Committee understands the community need for a conformance standard, which would authorize expanded use of the Istio mark. We plan to implement a conformance standard at a future date, and commit to creating a Conformance Task Force no later than Q4 2021. \n\nThe Istio Steering Committee reserves the right to deny specific use cases if, in the opinion of the Steering Committee, the use case would not be in the best interest of the Istio Community.\n\n    \n## Contact Us\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us at [istio-steering@googlegroups.com](mailto:istio-steering@googlegroups.com) if you are unsure whether your intended use of the Istio Trademarks is in compliance with these guidelines, or to ask for permission to use the Istio Trademarks, clearly describing the intended usage and duration.\n"

All changes, regardless of whether they are from\nnewcomers to the community or from the core team follow the\nsame process and are given the same level of review.\n\n- [Working groups](#working-groups)\n- [Code of conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n- [Team values](#team-values)\n- [Contributor license agreements](#contributor-license-agreements)\n- [Design documents](#design-documents)\n- [Contributing a feature](#contributing-a-feature)\n- [Setting up to contribute to Istio](#setting-up-to-contribute-to-istio)\n- [Pull requests](#pull-requests)\n- [Issues](#issues)\n- [Promote your company on istio.io](#promote-your-company-on-istioio)\n- [Tell the world you're using Istio](#tell-the-world-youre-using-istio)\n\nYou can find additional contributor material on the [Istio Wiki](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki).\n\n## Working groups\n\nThe Istio community is organized into a set of [working groups](WORKING-GROUPS.md).\nAny contribution to Istio should be started by first engaging with the\nappropriate working group.\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nAll members of the Istio community must abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Team values\n\nWe promote and encourage a set of [shared values](VALUES.md) to improve our\nproductivity and inter-personal interactions.\n\n## Contributor license agreements\n\nWe'd love to accept your contributions! But before we can take them, you will\nhave to fill out the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md).\n\nOnce you are covered by the CLA, we'll be able to accept your pull requests. This is\nnecessary because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your\ncontribution becomes part of this project. This agreement gives the CNCF (and its parent\nthe Linux Foundation) permission to use and redistribute your contributions as\npart of the project.\n\n## Design documents\n\nAny substantial design deserves a design document. Design documents are written with Google Docs and\nshould be shared with the community by adding the doc to our [team drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l_zqgBq_yfc1PfbJiWsFubXBtAz22sau)\nand sending a note to the appropriate working group to let people know the doc is there. To get write access\nto the drive, you'll need to be a [member](ROLES.md#member) of the Istio organization.\n\nAnybody can access the team drive for reading. To get access to comment, join the\n[istio-team-drive-access@](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/istio-team-drive-access) group.\nOnce you've done that, head to the [team drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l_zqgBq_yfc1PfbJiWsFubXBtAz22sau) and\nbehold all the docs.\n\nWhen documenting a new design, we recommend a 2-step approach:\n\n1. Use the short-form\n[RFC template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ewJoCcw5-04crH-M0xw4zFxz1cfwVCPnNyW4K3m4Yyc/template/preview)\nto outline your ideas and get early feedback.\n1. Once you have received sufficient feedback and consensus, you may use the longer-form\n[design doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16FLQK8uhhic1ovKnnOG3OXJjFKs2aHnSmbximidpKwM/template/preview)\nto specify and discuss your design in more details.\n\nTo use either template, open the template and select \"Use Template\" in order to bootstrap your document.\n\n## Contributing a feature\n\nIn order to contribute a feature to Istio you'll need to go through the following steps:\n\n- Discuss your idea with the appropriate [working groups](WORKING-GROUPS.md) on the working\ngroup's Slack channel.\n\n- Once there is general agreement that the feature is useful, create a GitHub issue to track the discussion. The issue should include information\nabout the requirements and use cases that it is trying to address. Include a discussion of the proposed design and technical details of the\nimplementation in the issue.\n\n- If the feature is substantial enough:\n\n  - Working group leads will ask for a design document as outlined in the previous section.\n  Create the design document and add a link to it in the GitHub issue. Don't forget to send a Slack to the\n  working group to let everyone know your document is ready for review.\n\n  - Depending of the breath of the design and how contentious it is, the working group leads may decide\n  the feature needs to be discussed in one or more working group meetings before being approved.\n\n  - Once the major technical issues are resolved and agreed upon, post a note to the working group's Slack\n  with the design decision and the general execution plan.\n\n- Submit PRs to [istio/istio](https://github.com/istio/istio) with your code changes.\n\n- Submit PRs to [istio/istio.io](https://github.com/istio/istio.io) with\ndocumentation for your feature, including usage examples when possible. See [here](https://istio.io/about/contribute/)\nto learn how to write docs for istio.io.\n\n> Note that we prefer bite-sized PRs instead of giant monster PRs. It's therefore preferable if you\ncan introduce large features in smaller reviewable changes that build on top of one another.\n\nIf you would like to skip the process of submitting an issue and\ninstead would prefer to just submit a pull request with your desired\ncode changes then that's fine. But keep in mind that there is no guarantee\nof it being accepted and so it is usually best to get agreement on the\nidea/design before time is spent coding it. However, sometimes seeing the\nexact code change can help focus discussions, so the choice is up to you.\n\n## Setting up to contribute to Istio\n\nCheck out this [README](https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/README.md) to learn about\nthe Istio source base and setting up your [development environment](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Preparing-for-Development).\n\n## Pull requests\n\nIf you're working on an existing issue, simply respond to the issue and express\ninterest in working on it. This helps other people know that the issue is\nactive, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.\n\nTo submit a proposed change:\n\n- Fork the affected repository.\n\n- Create a new branch for your changes.\n\n- Develop the code/fix.\n\n- Add new test cases. In the case of a bug fix, the tests should fail\n  without your code changes. For new features try to cover as many\n  variants as reasonably possible.\n\n- Modify the documentation as necessary.\n\n- Verify the entire CI process (building and testing) works.\n\nWhile there may be exceptions, the general rule is that all PRs should\nbe 100% complete - meaning they should include all test cases and documentation\nchanges related to the change.\n\nWhen ready, if you have not already done so, sign a\n[contributor license agreements](#contributor-license-agreements) and submit\nthe PR.\n\nSee [Writing Good Pull Requests](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Writing-Good-Pull-Requests) for guidance on creating\npull requests, and [Reviewing Pull Requests](https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Reviewing-Pull-Requests) for the PR review\nwe use.\n\n## Issues\n\n[GitHub issues](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/new/choose) can be used to report bugs or submit feature requests.\n\nWhen reporting a bug please include the following key pieces of information:\n\n- The version of the project you were using (e.g. version number,\n  or git commit)\n\n- Operating system you are using.\n\n- The exact, minimal, steps needed to reproduce the issue.\n  Submitting a 5 line script will get a much faster response from the team\n  than one that's hundreds of lines long.\n\n## Promote your company on istio.io\n\nIf your company supports Istio, you can list it on our [Ecosystem](https://istio.io/latest/about/ecosystem/)\nor [Training and Certification](https://istio.io/latest/about/training/) pages.\nUnder Ecosystem, we have categories for *providers* (who offer hosted or managed Istio services\nto their customers), *professional services* (who offer implementation support\nor consulting for Istio) and *integrations* (commercial or open source products\nthat work with Istio).\n\nTo add an entry to either page, edit [data/companies.yml](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/blob/master/data/companies.yml)\nand add your information in the `providers`, `pro_services`, `integrations`, `training` or `certification`\nsection, as appropriate. Please add your company logo, preferably in SVG\nformat, to [static/logos](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/blob/master/static/logos).\n\nThe Istio steering committee reserves the right to remove logos of companies that\nare not demeed to be in good standing in the community.\n\n## Tell the world you're using Istio\n\nAre you running Istio in production?  List yourself on our [Case Studies](https://istio.io/latest/about/case-studies/) page.\n\nIf you want to add your logo to our wall of users, add an entry to the `users`\nsection in [data/companies.yml](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/blob/master/data/companies.yml), and add your logo,\npreferably in SVG format, to [static/logos](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/blob/master/static/logos).\n\nIf you'd like to be interviewed for a full case study, please [create an issue](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/issues/new),\nand we'll be in touch!\n"

This holds\ntrue until the public disclosure date/time that was agreed upon by the list.\nMembers of the list and others may not use the information for anything other\nthan getting the issue fixed for your respective distribution's users.\n\nBefore any information from the list is shared with respective members of your\nteam required to fix said issue, they must agree to the same terms and only\nfind out information on a need-to-know basis.\n\nIn the unfortunate event you share the information beyond what is allowed by\nthis policy, you _must_ urgently inform the mailing list by replying to the \ninitial disclosure email. The email should specify exactly what information\nleaked and to whom. A retrospective will take place after the leak so\nwe can assess how to not make the same mistake in the future.\n\nIf you continue to leak information and break the policy outlined here, you\nwill be removed from the early disclosure list.\n\n## Membership\n\n| Email\t\t| Organization\t|\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\n| tanzu.psirt@broadcom.com | Broadcom |\n| istio-security-reports@f5.com | F5 Networks |\n| istio-security-vulnerability-notifications@google.com | Google |\n| argoprod@us.ibm.com | IBM |\n| envoy-security@microsoft.com | Microsoft |\n| istio-security@redhat.com | RedHat |\n| cve@solo.io | Solo.io |\n| istio-security@tetrate.io | Tetrate |\n\n### Membership criteria\n\nTo be eligible for the early disclosure mailing list, your\norganization must:\n\n1. Have an actively monitored security email alias for our project. This cannot be a personal\nemail address, it must be a corporate address owned by the organization.\n2.

Represents changes and additions to the main code base to introduce small new features and capabilities. These changes would typically\nbe introduced as normal PRs into the existing Istio repository, possibly within a feature branch.\n\n* **Extend**. Represents bigger changes to the platform, including the addition of new components. An example of this could be introducing a standard\nOpen Service Broker implementation for Istio. This type of change would typically be added in a subdirectory of the main Istio repo, and introduced via\na feature branch. Technologies of this type are subject to Istio's normal release cadence.\n\n* **Support**. Represents functionality that is peripheral to the main Istio product. These tools and other binaries can be added as\nstandalone repositories within the Istio GitHub organization. Technologies of this type may be have a different release cadence than\nthe Istio's normal release cadence.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Based on technical merits and alignment, the TOC must agree to the integration, must establish the proper form of integration, and must determine the overall protocol to follow (feature branch vs. master branch, timeline, testing requirements, doc requirements, etc).\n\n* Contributors of the new technology must be owners of the copyright of all subject material.\n\n* The transitive dependencies for **Augment** and **Extend** integrations must all use one of the supported Istio dependency license types\n(Apache, MIT, and BSD). **Support** integrations can have dependencies with additional license types (TBD: enumerate which ones)\n\n* Copyright for all contributed material must be explicitly assigned in the source code to \"Istio Authors\" and must be licensed under the Apache license.\n\n* Contributors must agree to whatever CLA the Istio project is currently subject to.\n\n* Contributors must agree to supply the initial documentation for the technology to <https://istio.io> or to Istio’s developer wiki on GitHub, as appropriate.\n\n* Contributors must agree to supply test suites that ensure the new technology functions properly and meets Istio’s testing and quality standards.\n\n* Contributors must agree to update the technology's API surface to comply with Istio’s overall design guidelines.\n"

Istio's control plane provides an abstraction\nlayer over the underlying cluster management platform, such as Kubernetes,\nMesos, etc.\n\nVisit [istio.io](https://istio.io) for in-depth information about using Istio.\n\n## Istio authors\nIstio is an open-source project with an active development community. The project was started\nby teams from Google and IBM, in partnership with the Envoy team at Lyft.\n\n## Community Meeting\n\nWe have public, [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-zVlo1F3mUbExQ96fABWcQ), community meetings.\nThey happen on the fourth Thursday of every month at 10 AM US/Pacific. [Map that to your local time](https://time.is/compare/1000_in_San_Francisco,_California).\n\n[Join this group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/istio-community-video-meetings)\nto have the meetings automatically added to your calendar.\nYou can also find them on [the community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=i10ogf58krfbrsjai5qi16g4do%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles), along with other major community events.\n\nMeeting agendas and notes can be accessed in the [working doc](http://bit.ly/istiocommunitymeet).\n\nInterested in presenting? Please send your abstract to istio-steering@googlegroups.com.\nThis is the information we need from you:\n\n    * Name\n    * Role and Company\n    * Short Speaker Bio\n    * Talk title and a short abstract\n    * Talk Format(Presentation/Demo) and Session Length\n    * Email to connect\n\nSuitable content:\n\n    * Istio new feature releases and project updates\n    * Tutorials and demos\n    * Use cases\n    * Open source content that relates vendor or platform to Istio installation and use\n\nUnsuitable content\n\n    * Demos that are disparaging to the Istio project, its functionality or community\n    * Demos that do not address Istio in any way, including interacting with Istio APIs or interfaces\n    * Blatant vendor pitches\n\n## How can I help?\n\nSee our [community page](https://istio.io/about/community/) for ways to get involved\nin our community.\n\nTo dig deeper, check out the [architecture](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/architecture/)\nand read some [design docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md#design-documents).\n\nIf you're looking for something to do to get your feet wet working on Istio, look for GitHub issues\nmarked with the Help Wanted label:\n\n- [Primary Istio repo](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community%2Fhelp+wanted%22)\n- [Documentation repo](https://github.com/istio/istio.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)\n\nOf course, even if there's not an issue opened for it, we can always use more\ntesting throughout the platform. Similarly, we can always use more docs, richer docs,\nand insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post?\n\n## Questions and issues\n\nIf you've got questions or issues with using Istio, check our [discussion board](https://github.com/istio/istio/discussions)\nand be sure to connect to our [community](https://istio.io/about/community/) where there's always\nsomeone ready to lend a hand.\n\nIf you're a developer trying to hack on or use the Istio code, head to\n#contributors on the [Istio Slack](https://slack.istio.io/) for help.\n"

assigned issues and PRs until they become a member, but will not allow tests to be run against their PRs automatically\nnor allow them to interact with the PR bot.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* Working on some contribution to the project that would benefit from the ability to have PRs or Issues to be assigned to the contributor\n\n* <a href=\"#sponsor\">Sponsored</a> by 1 member\n\n## Member\n\nEstablished community members are expected to demonstrate their adherence to the principles in this document, familiarity with project\norganization, roles, policies, procedures, conventions, etc., and technical and/or writing ability.\n\nMembers are continuously active contributors in the community. They can have issues and PRs assigned to them, participate in working group\nmeetings, and pre-submit tests are automatically run for their PRs. Members are expected to remain active contributors to the community.\n\nAll members are encouraged to help with the code review burden, although each PR must be reviewed by one or more official maintainers for\nthe area before being accepted into the source base.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* Has pushed at least one PR to the Istio repositories within the last 6 months.\n\n* Member of #contributors on the [Istio Slack](https://slack.istio.io)\n\n* Actively contributing to 1 or more areas.\n\nMembers are expected to be active participants in the project on an on-going basis. If an individual doesn't contribute to the project for\na 180 day period, than that individual may lose membership. On-going contributions include:\n\n- Successfully merging pull requests\n- Triaging issues or pull requests\n- Commenting on issues or pull requests\n- Closing issues or pull requests\n\n### Becoming a member\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a member and meet the requirements above, you can join the organization by adding yourself to the members list under [`org/members.yaml`](org/members.yaml). Once that has been done, submit a Pull Request with the change and fill out the pull request template with all information requested.\n\n### Responsibilities and privileges\n\n* Responsive to issues and PRs assigned to them\n\n* Active owner of code they have contributed (unless ownership is explicitly transferred)\n\n    * Code is well tested\n\n    * Tests consistently pass\n\n    * Addresses bugs or issues discovered after code is accepted\n\nMembers who frequently contribute code are expected to proactively perform code reviews for the area that they are active in.\n\n## Documentation Reviewer\n\nA **Documentation Reviewer** is trusted to only approve\ncontent that meets the acceptance criteria described in the\n[contribution guides](https://istio.io/about/contribute/).\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo become a **Reviewer**, contributors must meet the following **requirements**:\n\n* Be a **Member** of the Istio community.\n* Perform 5 substantial contributions to the `istio.io` repo. Substantial\n  contributions include the following examples:\n\n    * New content\n    * Content reviews\n    * Content improvements\n\n* Demonstrate a solid commitment to documentation quality and use of our style\n  guide.\n* Be sponsored by an Istio Maintainer or WG Lead.\n\n### Responsibilities\n\n* Review PRs in `istio/istio.io` following the process described in the\n  [How to review content](https://istio.io/about/contribute/github/#review) guide.\n* Ensure the relevant technical Working Group is added as a reviewer and ensure\n  a WG lead or maintainer has approved the PR.\n\n### Privileges\n\n* Content approved by a **Reviewer** gets prioritized by Maintainers and WG Leads.\n* Reviewers can place a `pre-reviewed` label to notify the Docs WG Leads and\n  Maintainers to expedite publication of the pre-reviewed content.\n\nContent reviewers can't merge content into the `istio/istio.io` master; only\nDocs Maintainers and WG Leads can merge content into master.\n\n## Maintainer\n\nMaintainers review and approve code contributions. While code review is focused on code quality and correctness,\napproval is focused on holistic acceptance of a contribution including: backwards / forwards compatibility, adhering to API and flag\nconventions, subtle performance and correctness issues, interactions with other parts of the system, etc. Maintainer status is scoped to a\npart of the codebase and is reflected in a CODEOWNERS file.\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe following apply to the part of the codebase for which one would be a maintainer:\n\n* Member for at least 3 months\n\n* Contributed at least 30 substantial PRs to the codebase\n\n* Must remain an active participant in the community by contributing\ncode, performing reviews, triaging issues, etc.\n\n* Knowledgeable about the codebase\n\n* Sponsored by a working group lead with no objections from other leads\n\nIf a maintainer becomes inactive in the project for over a year, the individual will be asked to transition to an\nemeritus maintainer. Emeritus maintainers lose their ability to approve code contributions, but retain their voting rights\nfor up to one year.

The work of the TOC shall encompass:\n    * Conducting regular committee meetings to address pertinent topics and producing published meeting notes.\n    * Creating, reviewing, approving, and publishing technical project governance documents.\n    * Formulating proposals for consideration by individual working groups to guide their efforts toward achieving a unified project-wide objective.\n    * Reviewing, addressing, and commenting on project issues.\n    * Serving as a high-level advisory body for technical inquiries or designs submitted by working groups.\n2. The TOC is expected to operate by consensus. Consequently, there shall be an even maximum number of seats at all times.\n3. TOC members shall act independently, in their individual capacities, and shall prioritize the best interests of the project and the community. TOC membership is associated with the individual, irrespective of their employment status.\n4. A standing joint session of the TOC and Steering Committee shall be convened at least once per calendar quarter. During these sessions, both the TOC and Steering Committee shall present on topics pertinent to their respective charters and responsibilities.\n5. A special joint session of the TOC and Steering Committee must be held no later than 1 month following the ratification of the Steering Committee for its annual term. In this session, the Steering Committee shall consult with the TOC to evaluate contribution dynamics, workload, and effectiveness of both the Steering Committee and TOC. This review aims to determine whether any changes are necessary to further advance the project.\n\n### Membership and Elections\n\n1. The TOC shall consist of six seats. Should there be an insufficient number of qualified candidates, the TOC may temporarily function with fewer than six members.\n2. Each seat shall be held for a term of 2 years. The election cycles shall be staggered such that half of the seats shall be up for re-election each year. The election process shall commence 2 months subsequent to the ratification of the Steering Committee for that year.\n\n### Qualification and Eligibility\n\n1. Prior to each election, individuals who have served as Istio maintainers for a minimum of 3 months shall be given the opportunity to stand as candidates.\n2. Candidates shall be recognized within the Istio community as collaborative technical leaders with a demonstrated history of leading project design work or engaging in other consensus-building activities.\n3. The Steering Committee and TOC shall jointly ensure a viable pipeline of candidates, including identifying opportunities for mentoring emerging leaders in the project to the point where they are likely to meet the qualification criteria in a future election.\n4. Candidates removed from the TOC by a vote of no confidence within the past 12 months shall be deemed ineligible to stand for election.\n5. The Steering Committee, with assistance from the current TOC, shall evaluate candidates against the following criteria, assessed over the preceding 12 months. A candidate must satisfy the criteria for \"Chop Wood, Carry Water\" and at least one additional criterion.\n\n  <ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\">\n      <dl>\n          <dt><b><i>Chop Wood, Carry Water:</i></b></dt>\n          <dd>Demonstrates visibility in technical and collaborative aspects of the project, including but not limited to\n              weekly working group meetings, monthly TOC meetings, and Slack discussions.</dd>\n          <dt><b><i>Senior Maintainer:</i></b></dt>\n          <dd>Has authored and merged at least 20 substantial pull requests (PRs).</dd>\n          <dt><b><i>User Champion:</i></b></dt>\n          <dd>\n              Has resolved at least 5 user-reported issues with pull requests (PRs). Demonstrates active engagement in Slack channels or GitHub issues/discussions in support of users.\n          </dd>\n          <dt><b><i>Project Manager:</i></b></dt>\n          <dd>\n              Demonstrates active involvement in organizing the project’s daily operations, including bug triage, roadmap\n              qualification and definition, leading meetings, driving consensus, and organizing community events.\n          </dd>\n          <dt><b><i>Architect:</i></b></dt>\n          <dd>\n              Has produced at least 3 design documents for features incorporated into the project roadmap. Has reviewed at least 10 design documents authored by other community members.\n          </dd>\n      </dl>\n  </ul>\n\n6. Candidates must submit a written application, including a self-assessment against the qualification criteria. The application shall be forwarded to the TOC for confidential feedback and subsequently returned to the Steering Committee.\n7. The Steering Committee shall individually vote on each candidate to determine their suitability for serving on the TOC. An affirmative vote of at least 60% of the seats is required for a candidate to be approved.\n   * If the number of candidates is fewer than or equal to the number of open seats, this vote shall serve as the election.\n   * If the number of candidates exceeds the number of open seats, this vote shall qualify candidates to proceed to a second round of voting.\n8. Should there be more qualified candidates than open TOC seats, the Steering Committee shall select the winning candidates via a Condorcet election.\n\n### Vacancies\n\n1. In the event that a TOC member vacates their seat during their term, a by-election shall be conducted to fill the position for the remainder of the term in accordance with the regular qualification and election procedures.\n2. The Steering Committee may initiate a vote of no confidence in a TOC member. The member shall be removed if the motion is approved by at least 60% of the Steering Committee seats. The position shall be filled for the remainder of the term through the regular vacancy process.\n\n## Meetings & process\n\nThe TOC meets regularly. The meetings are open to anyone interested, so please join us. The meeting schedule is tracked\non the [working group calendar](WORKING-GROUPS.md#working-group-meetings); please follow the link for more details.\n\nCommunity members are encouraged to suggest topics for discussion ahead of the TOC meetings, and are invited\nto observe these meetings and engage with the TOC.

Try to learn about what your customers care about, how they think about it. Design for them, not for you.\n\n- Optimize for the **overall project**, not your own area or feature\n  - A shortcut for one individual can mean a lot of extra work or disruption for\n    the rest of the team.\n\n- Our repos should always be in release shape: **Always Green**\n  - This lets us move faster in the mid and long term\n  - This implies investments in build/test infrastructure to have fast, reliable\n    tests to ensure that we can release at any time.\n  - Extra discipline may require more work by individuals to keep the build in\n    good state, but less work overall for the team.\n\n- Be **specific**, **respectful** and **courteous**\n  - Disagreements are expected, but don't use broad\n    generalizations, exaggerations, or judgement words that can be taken\n    personally. Consider other people’s perspectives (including the wide range of\n    use for Istio). Empathize with our users. Focus on the specific\n    issue at hand, and remember that we all care about the project, first and\n    foremost.\n  - Emails to the [mailing lists](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-a-feature),\n    document comments, or meetings are often better and higher bandwidth ways to\n    communicate complex and nuanced design issues, as opposed to protracted\n    heated live chats.\n  - Be mindful of the terminology you are using, it may not be the same as\n    someone else's and cause misunderstanding. To promote clear and precise\n    communication, please define the terms you are using in context.\n\n- Raising issues is great, suggesting solutions is even better\n  - Think of a proposed alternative and improvement rather than just what you\n    perceive as wrong.\n  - If you have no immediate solution even after thinking about it - if\n    something does seem significant, do raise it to someone that may be able to\n    also think of solutions or to the group (don’t stay frustrated! Feel safe\n    in bringing up issues)\n  - Avoid rehashing old issues that have been already resolved/decided (unless\n    you have new insights or information)\n\n- Be productive and **happy**, and most importantly, have _fun_ :-)\n"

          "content": "# Istio Working Group Processes\n\nThis document describes the processes we use to manage the Istio working groups. This includes how they are formed, how leads\nare established, how they are run, etc.\n\n* [Why working groups?](#why-working-groups)\n* [Proposing a new working group](#proposing-a-new-working-group)\n* [Setting up a working group](#setting-up-a-working-group)\n  * [Dissolving a working group](#dissolving-a-working-group)\n* [Running a working group](#running-a-working-group)\n  * [Be open](#be-open)\n  * [Making decisions](#making-decisions)\n  * [Subgroups](#subgroups)\n  * [Escalations](#escalations)\n\n## Why working groups?\n\nIstio working groups are organizations responsible for the design and implementation of large architectural aspects of the overall Istio project.\nWorking groups operate with a fair amount of autonomy within the broader scope of the project. They tend to be long-lived, representing major\ninitiatives over Istio’s lifetime.\n\nSome working groups focus on specific technologies. For example, the Extensions and Telemetry working group focuses on WebAssembly based\nextensibility and extensions for features such as Rate Limiting, Tracing, Monitoring, Logging.\n\nThe [Technical Oversight Committee](TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) (a.k.a. TOC) is responsible for the Istio project as a whole. It sets the overall direction\nof the project, helps make crosscutting architectural decisions, helps establish and dissolve working groups, and helps ensure all working\ngroups are generally rowing in the same direction.\n\nAlthough working groups are relatively lightweight structures, we want to keep the number of working groups low in order to keep things\nmanageable.\n\n## Proposing a new working group\n\nIf you’ve identified a substantial architectural area which would benefit from long-lived, concerted and focused design, then you should\nconsider creating a new working group. To do so, you need to:\n\n* **Create a charter**. This should be a few paragraphs explaining:\n\n    * The mission of the working group\n\n    * The goals of the working group (problems being solved)\n\n    * The scope of the working group (topics, subsystems, code repos, areas of responsibility)\n\n* **Nominate an initial set of leads**. The leads set the agenda for the working group and serve as final arbiters on any technical decision.\nSee [below](#running-a-working-group) for information on the responsibilities of leads and requirements for nominating them.\n\n* **Prepare a Roadmap**. Create a preliminary 3 month roadmap for what the working group would focus on.\n\n* **Send an Email**. Write up an email with your charter, nominated leads, and roadmap, and post it to #toc-steering-questions on the [Istio Slack](https://slack.istio.io/).\nThe technical oversight committee will evaluate the request and decide whether the working group should be\nformed, whether it should be merely a subgroup of an existing working group, or whether it should be subsumed by an existing working group.\n\n## Setting up a working group\n\nOnce approval has been granted by the technical oversight committee to form a working group, the working group leads need to take a few\nsteps to establish the working group:\n\n* **Create a Google Drive Folder**. Create a folder to hold your working group documents within this parent\n[folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15y-2OIcjP9DNF7WLvHL0Hyn_XXxaYoOm). Call your folder \"GROUP_NAME\".\n\n* **Create a Roadmap Document**. Create a document in the above folder and call it \"GROUP_NAME Group Roadmap\". Put your initial\nroadmap in the document.\n\n* **Register the Working Group**. Go to [WORKING-GROUPS.md](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/WORKING-GROUPS.md) and\nadd your working group name, the names of the leads, the working group charter, and a link to the meeting you created.\n\n* **Announce your Working Group**. Post a note to #contributors on the Istio Slack (https://slack.istio.io/)\nto announce your new working group. Include your charter in the post.\n\n* **Attend the Combined Working Group Meeting**. Check the meeting agenda to verify if something was added relative to your working group.\nIt is desirable for the leads to attend the weekly meeting in case items do come up.\n\nCongratulations, you now have a fully formed working group!\n\n### Dissolving a working group\n\nSome working groups are ephemeral or naturally reach the end of their useful life. Working group leads can petition to dissolve their working groups in a TOC meeting. The\ntechnical oversight committee also reserves the right to dissolve or recharter working groups over time as necessary.\n\n## Leads\n\nEach working group must have 2 or 3 leads, with at least two different organizations represented. Working group leads must meet certain requirements, including having been members of the Istio project for a year, and a maintainer for at least 3 months.\n\nPlease see the [Community Roles](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/ROLES.md) document for a full\ndescription of a lead’s role and requirements.\n\n## Running a working group\n\nLeads are responsible for running a working group. Running the group involves a few activities:\n\n* **Meetings**. Help with running the combined working group meetings. Be sure to attend the meeting if there is an agenda item\nfor your workgroup. Ensure the meetings are recorded, and properly archived on YouTube.\n\n* **Notes**. Ensure that meeting notes are kept up to date. The lead may delegate note-taking duties.\nProvide a link to the recorded meeting in the notes.\n\n* **Roadmap**. Establish **and maintain** a roadmap for the working group outlining the areas of focus for the working group over the next\n3 months.\n\n* **Report**. Report current status to the TOC meeting every as appropriate.\n\n### Be open\n\nThe community design process is done in the open. Working groups should communicate primarily through the public\nworking group Slack channel and meetings, through design documents in the working group’s folder, through GitHub issues, and GitHub PRs.\nAvoid private emails and/or meetings when possible.\n\n### Making decisions\n\nIn general, working groups operate in a highly cooperative environment. Working groups discuss designs in the open and take input\nfrom the community at large when making technical choices. The working group leads are ultimately responsible for setting the\ndirection of the working group and making the tough technical choices affecting the working group.\n\n### Subgroups\n\nSubgroups are ad hoc subteams within a working group with a special focus on a set of problems or technologies. We don’t formalize processes\nfor subgroups, each working group can decide when subgroups are needed and how they operate.\n\n### Escalations\n\nWorking groups can get blocked on specific technical disagreements. Leads are expected to generally resolve such issues and allow work\nto progress.\n\nSometimes, different working groups can have conflicting goals or requirements. Leads from all affected working groups generally work\ntogether and come to an agreeable conclusion.\n\nIf a community member disagrees with decisions or designs made by a working group, the first recourse is to consult the working group\nleads and try to hash things out. If that's not satisfactory, then the community member is invited to prepare an alternate proposal\nthat can be shared with the community.\n\nIn all cases, remaining blocking issues can be raised to the [technical oversight committee](TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md) to help\nresolve the situation. To trigger an escalation, add an entry to the [TOC's agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lxJqtlaQhmV2EwsNnS6h-_O4pobZQZuMjrzOeMgVI0/edit#heading=h.o8pz6aqnzzgk)\nand come to a TOC meeting. Come prepared with an explanation of the underlying problem as well as\ncogent arguments for both sides.\n"
