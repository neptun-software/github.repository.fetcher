Set this to the version of Kubernetes that you're using in production for the best results. (default \"v1.18\")\n  -o, --output-format string                Set to 'human', 'json', 'ci' or 'sarif'. If set to ci, kube-score will output the program in a format that is easier to parse by other programs. Sarif output allows for easier integration with CI platforms. (default \"human\")\n      --output-version string               Changes the version of the --output-format. The 'json' format has version 'v2' (default) and 'v1' (deprecated, will be removed in v1.7.0). The 'human' and 'ci' formats has only version 'v1' (default). If not explicitly set, the default version for that particular output format will be used.\n  -v, --verbose count                       Enable verbose output, can be set multiple times for increased verbosity.\n```\n\n### Ignoring a test\n\nTests can be ignored in the whole run of the program, with the `--ignore-test` flag.\n\nA test can also be ignored on a per-object basis, by adding the annotation `kube-score/ignore` to the object.\nThe value should be a comma-separated string of the [test IDs](README_CHECKS.md).\n\nExample:\n\nTesting this object will temporarily disable the `service-type` test, which warns against using services of type NodePort.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: node-port-service-with-ignore\n  namespace: foospace\n  annotations:\n    kube-score/ignore: service-type\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: my-app\n  ports:\n  - protocol: TCP\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: 8080\n  type: NodePort\n```\n\n### Enabling an optional test\n\nOptional tests can be enabled in the whole run of the program, with the `--enable-optional-test` flag.\n\nA test can also be enabled on a per-object basis, by adding the annotation `kube-score/enable` to the object.\nThe value should be a comma-separated string of the [test IDs](README_CHECKS.md).\n\nExample:\n\nTesting this object will enable the `container-seccomp-profile` test.\nAlso, multiple tests defined by `kube-score/ignore` are also ignored at the same.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: optional-test-manifest-deployment\n  labels:\n    app: optional-test-manifest\n  annotations:\n    kube-score/ignore: pod-networkpolicy,container-resources,container-image-pull-policy,container-security-context-privileged,container-security-context-user-group-id,container-security-context-readonlyrootfilesystem,container-ephemeral-storage-request-and-limit\n    kube-score/enable: container-seccomp-profile\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: optional-test-manifest\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: optional-test-manifest\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: optional-test-manifest\n        image: busybox:1.34\n        command:\n        - /bin/sh\n        - -c\n        - date; env; tail -f /dev/null\n```\n\n## Building from source\n\n`kube-score` requires [Go](https://golang.org/) `1.21` or later to build. Clone this repository, and then:\n\n```bash\n# Build the project\ngo build ./cmd/kube-score\n\n# Run all tests\ngo test -v ./...\n```\n\n## Contributing?\n\nDo you want to help out?

          "content": "# Readiness and Liveness Probes\n\nKubernetes supports three types of probes, that all serve different purposes, and have different pros and cons.\n\nThis article is here to describe what recommendations kube-score will make in what situations.\n\n## Different probe types\n\n### `readinessProbe`\n\nThis probe roughly answers the question\n\n> Is it a good idea to send traffic to this Pod right now?\n\nA common *misunderstanding* is that, since Kubernetes manages the Pods, you don't need to do graceful draining of Pods during shutdown.\n\nWithout a readinessProbe you're risking that:\n\n* Traffic is sent to the Pod before the server has started.\n* Traffic is still sent to the Pod _after_ the Pod has stopped. \n\n**kube-score recommends**:\n\nEvery application that is targeted by a Service to:\n\n* Setup a readinessProbe that responds with a healthy status when: The application is fully booted, and ready to serve traffic.\n* Set `interval` (default: 10s), `timeout` (default: 1s), `successThreshold` (default: 1), `failureThreshold` (default: 3) to your needs. In the default configuration, your application will fail for 30s (+ the time it takes for the network to react), for clients to stop sending traffic to your application.\n* Don't depend on downstream dependencies, such as other services or databases in your probe. If the dependency has a hickup, or for example, a database is restarted, removing your Pods from the Load Balancers rotation will likely only make the downtime worse.\n* Handle shutdowns gracefully: Applications should start to fail the readinessProbe after receiving `SIGTERM`, and _wait_ until the service is unregistered from all Load Balancers, before shutting down. As an alternative to this, a [`preStop`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/attach-handler-lifecycle-event/#define-poststart-and-prestop-handlers) hook with a sleep can be used. \n\n### `livenessProbe`\n\nThis probe roughly answers the question\n\n> Is the _container_ healthy right now, or do we need to restart it?\n\nIt can be used to let Kubernetes know if your application is deadlocked, and needs to be restarted. Only the container with the failing probe will be restarted, other containers in the same Pod will be unaffected.\n\n**kube-score recommends**:\n\n* If you don't know why you need a livenessProbe, don't configure it.\n* It should _never_, be the same as your `readinessProbe`.\n* The livenessProbe should *never* depend on downstream dependencies, such as databases or other services.\n\n\n### `startupProbe` (alpha since v1.16, beta since v1.17)\n\nThis probe roughly answers the question\n\n> Should we start running the livenessProbe now?\n\nFor applications that take a longer time to boot than the livenessProbes `initialDelaySeconds` + `periodSeconds` * `failureThreshold`, a `startupProbe` can be configured.\n\nThe startupProbe allows you to decrease the liveness probes `initialDelaySeconds`, and catch application deadlocks earlier.\n\nAs soon as the startupProbe has succeeded once, the livenessProbe will start to be executed.\n\n**kube-score recommends**:\n\n* Configure a startupProbe if you have a livenessProbe configured. \n\n## Further reading\n\n* [Pod Lifecycle, kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#container-probes)\n* [Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes, kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)\n* [Liveness probes are dangerous, srcco.de](https://srcco.de/posts/kubernetes-liveness-probes-are-dangerous.html)\n"
