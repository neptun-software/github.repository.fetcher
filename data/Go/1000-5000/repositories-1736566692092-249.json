Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at jaq@google.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]\n\n[homepage]: http://contributor-covenant.org\n[version]: http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/\n"

First, read this page (including the small print at the end).\n\n### Before you contribute\nBefore we can use your code, you must sign the\n[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)\n(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the\ncopyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our\ncodebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also\nneed to be sure of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you\nknow that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign\nthe CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has\napproved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.\nBefore you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with\nus first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and\npossibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid\nfrustration later on.\n\n### Code reviews\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose.\n\nPlease read the [style guide](docs/style.md) for tips on the project coding\nguidelines.\n\n### Response Time\n\nThis repository is maintained as a best effort service.\n\nResponse times to issues and PRs may vary with the availability of the\nmaintainers.  We appreciate your patience.\n\nPRs with unit tests will be merged promptly.  All other requests (issues and\nPRs) may take longer to be responded to.\n\n### The small print\nContributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than\nthe one above, the Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement.\n\n"

Using the\nlatest production release binary is the recommended way of installing **mtail**.\n\nWindows, OSX and Linux binaries are available.\n\n### Building from source\n\nThe simplest way to get `mtail` is to `go get` it directly.\n\n`go get github.com/google/mtail/cmd/mtail`\n\nThis assumes you have a working Go environment with a recent Go version.  Usually mtail is tested to work with the last two minor versions  (e.g. Go 1.12 and Go 1.11).\n\nIf you want to fetch everything, you need to turn on Go Modules to succeed because of the way Go Modules have changed the way go get treats source trees with no Go code at the top level.\n\n```\nGO111MODULE=on go get -u github.com/google/mtail\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/google/mtail\nmake install\n```\n\nIf you develop the compiler you will need some additional tools\nlike `goyacc` to be able to rebuild the parser.\n\nSee the [Build instructions](docs/Building.md) for more details.\n\nA `Dockerfile` is included in this repository for local development as an\nalternative to installing Go in your environment, and takes care of all the\nbuild dependency installation, if you don't care for that.\n\n\n## Deployment\n\n`mtail` works best when paired with a timeseries-based calculator and\nalerting tool, like [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io).\n\n> So what you do is you take the metrics from the log files and\n> you bring them down to the monitoring system?\n\n[It deals with the instrumentation so the engineers don't have\nto!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/quotes/?item=qt0386890)  It has the\nextraction skills!  It is good at dealing with log files!!\n\n## Read More\n\nFull documentation at http://google.github.io/mtail/\n\nRead more about writing `mtail` programs:\n\n* [Programming Guide](docs/Programming-Guide.md)\n* [Language Reference](docs/Language.md)\n* [Metrics](docs/Metrics.md)\n* [Managing internal state](docs/state.md)\n* [Testing your programs](docs/Testing.md)\n\nRead more about hacking on `mtail`\n\n* [Building from source](docs/Building.md)\n* [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [Style](docs/style.md)\n\nRead more about deploying `mtail` and your programs in a monitoring environment\n\n* [Deploying](docs/Deploying.md)\n* [Interoperability](docs/Interoperability.md) with other systems\n* [Troubleshooting](docs/Troubleshooting.md)\n* [FAQ](docs/faq.md)\n\n\n## Getting more help and reporting defects\n\nIf you have any questions, please use the [GitHub Discussions Q&A](https://github.com/google/mtail/discussions/new?category=q-a).\n\nWe also have an email list : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mtail-users\n\nFor any defects please [file a new issue](https://github.com/google/mtail/issues/new).\n"

Not sure if there's a performance win here, but we want to avoid memcpy if we can.\n\n\nWhy is strings.Builder slower than bytes.Buffer when the latter's docstring recommends the former?\n\n\nci: rerun failed tests to see if they're flaky.\n\n\nFind out if OpenTelemetry is better than OpenCensus when creating no-op trace spans.\n\n\nTest that when path/* is the logpathpattern that we handle log rotation, e.g. log -> log.1\n = how can this work, we can't tell the difference between log.1 being a rotation or a new log.  This could work if we can have a tailer-level registry of filenames currently with a goroutine.  But we don't know the name of the new file when filestream creates a new goroutine for the replacement; fd.Stat() doesn't return the new name of the file.\n - Workaround: warn when '*' is the last of a glob pattern.\n\n\nVM profiler, when enabled, times instructions so user gets feedback on where their program is slow.\n\nCan we create a linter that checks for code patterns like 'path.Join' and warns against them?  Can govet be made to do this?\n\nDetect when a regular expression compiled doesn't have a onepass program, and report a compile warning.  we can't do this today with the regexp API, because it's not an exported field, and the onepass compilation step is not an exported function.  IF we can do this, we can warn the user that their regular expression has ambiguity and will backtrack.  See MATCH_NETWORK above.\n\nDo we have a precision problem that shold be solved by using math/big for literals in the AST.  Extra credit: find out if the vm runtime should use big internally as well?\n\nregular expression matching is expensive.  prefilter on match prefix.  for extra credit, filter on all substrings of the expressions, using aho-corasick.\n\nonce the vm refactoring has completed, move the VM execute method into per-opcode functions, and use the same state machine function as in lexer.NextToken() to simulate threaded code as we don't get tail recursion in Go.  The plan is to see if execution speed is same or better -- expect moving to function calls to be slower unless inlined, but gain in readability and reuse.\n\nrefactor vm further to replace stack with registers, we need typed registers to remove the pop runtime type cast. new opcodes to do migration from stack to register based ops required\n\n\nOnce the tailer can read from sockets, I'll move it out of `internal/`.\n\n\nPass a Logger as an option to tailer and vm.\n\nStatusHTML in vm reads expvars; can we not do that?\n\nMove from expvar to OpenSomething metrics.\n\nShould the exporter move into the metric package?\n\n\nShould the waker move into the tailer package?\n\n\nBenchmarks on GHA are too variable.  Compute benchmarks old and new in same instance, per guidelines from \"Software Microbenchmarking in the Cloud. How Bad is it Really?\" Laaber et al.\n\nMove loc and useCurrentYear out of VM and into Runtime env.\n\nMove const folding into parser during AST build.\nConst-fold identity functions.\n\n\nBoth tailer and logstream probably don't need to do URL parsing.  Tailer could do it on the log path patterns before filling up the poll patterns list.  Non-globs don't need repolling, and any with a scheme can already be constructed by TailPattern.\n\n\nTrim unused string and regexp constants, as .e.g /s/ && 1 gets optimised away.\n\nCollapse duplicate string and regexp constants.\n"
