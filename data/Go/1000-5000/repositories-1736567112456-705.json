And you're\nready to **automatically deploy** this project:\n\n```bash\ncgapp deploy\n```\n\nThat's all you need to know to start! 🎉\n\n### 🐳 Docker-way to quick start\n\nIf you don't want to install Create Go App CLI to your system, you feel free\nto using our official [Docker image][docker_url] and run CLI from isolated\ncontainer:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} koddr/cgapp:latest [COMMAND]\n```\n\n> 🔔 Please note: the `deploy` command is currently **unavailable** in this\n> image.\n\n## 📖 Project Wiki\n\nThe best way to better explore all the features of the **Create Go App CLI**\nis to read the project [Wiki][repo_wiki_url] and take part in\n[Discussions][repo_discussions_url] and/or [Issues][repo_issues_url].\n\nYes, the most frequently asked questions (FAQ) are also\n[here][repo_wiki_faq_url].\n\n## ⚙️ Commands & Options\n\n### `create`\n\nCLI command for create a new project with the interactive console UI.\n\n```bash\ncgapp create [OPTION]\n```\n\n| Option | Description                                              | Type   | Default | Required? |\n| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------- | --------- |\n| `-t`   | Enables to define custom backend and frontend templates. | `bool` | `false` | No        |\n\n![cgapp_create][cgapp_create_gif]\n\n- 📺 Full demo video: https://recordit.co/OQAwkZBrjN\n- 📖 Docs: https://github.com/create-go-app/cli/wiki/Command-create\n\n### `deploy`\n\nCLI command for deploy Docker containers with your project via Ansible to\nthe remote server.\n\n> 🔔 Make sure that you have [Python 3.8+][python_url] and\n> [Ansible 2.9+][ansible_url] installed on your computer.\n\n```bash\ncgapp deploy [OPTION]\n```\n\n| Option | Description                                                                                            | Type   | Default | Required? |\n| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------- | --------- |\n| `-k`   | Prompt you to provide the remote user sudo password (_a standard Ansible `--ask-become-pass` option_). | `bool` | `false` | No        |\n\n![cgapp_deploy][cgapp_deploy_gif]\n\n- 📺 Full demo video: https://recordit.co/ishTf0Au1x\n- 📖 Docs: https://github.com/create-go-app/cli/wiki/Command-deploy\n\n## 📝 Production-ready project templates\n\n### Backend\n\n- Backend template with Golang built-in [net/http][net_http_url] package:\n  - [`net/http`][cgapp_net-http-template_url] — simple REST API with CRUD\n    and JWT auth.\n- Backend template with [Fiber][fiber_url]:\n  - [`fiber`][cgapp_fiber-template_url] — complex REST API with CRUD, JWT auth\n    with renew token, DB and cache.\n- Backend template with [go-chi][chi_url]:\n  - [`chi`][cgapp_chi-template_url] — a basic application with health check.\n\n### Frontend\n\nFrontend part will be generated using awesome tool [Vite.js][vitejs_url]\nunder the hood.\n\nSo, you'll always get the latest version of React, Preact, Vue, Svelte,\nSolid, Lit, Qwik, or pure JavaScript/TypeScript templates for your project.\n\n| Name                              | Description                      | JavaScript  | Typescript     |\n| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Pure                              | A pure JavaScript/Typescript app | `vanilla`   | `vanilla-ts`   |\n| [React][react_url]                | A common React app               | `react`     | `react-ts`     |\n| [React (with SWC)][react_swc_url] | A React app with SWC             | `react-swc` | `react-swc-ts` |\n| [Preact][preact_url]              | A common Preact app              | `preact`    | `preact-ts`    |\n| [Vue.js][vuejs_url]               | A common Vue.js app              | `vue`       | `vue-ts`       |\n| [Svelte][svelte_url]              | A common Svelte app              | `svelte`    | `svelte-ts`    |\n| [Solid][solid_url]                | A common Solid app               | `solid`     | `solid-ts`     |\n| [Lit][lit_url]                    | A common Lit app                 | `lit`       | `lit-ts`       |\n| [Qwik][qwik_url]                  | A common Qwik app                | `qwik`      | `qwik-ts`      |\n\nThe `Next.js` and `Nuxt` frontend parts will be generated using the latest\n`create-next-app` and `nuxi` utilities.\n\n| Name                       | Description            | JavaScript | Typescript  |\n| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |\n| [Next.js][nextjs_url]      | A common Next.js app   | `next`     | `next-ts`   |\n| [Nuxt][nuxt_url]           | A common Nuxt v3 app   | -          | `nuxt`      |\n| [Sveltekit][sveltekit_url] | A common Sveltekit app | -          | `sveltekit` |\n\n> ❗️ Please make sure that you have `npm` version `7` or higher installed to\n> create the frontend part of the project correctly.
