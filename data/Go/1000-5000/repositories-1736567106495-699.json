It has a really good quality of the code along with\n    the detailed comments on each function and class. It also implemented  MMR, Huffman tables and arithmetic\n    decompressors along with all JBIG2 segments.\n\n* [AGL JBIG2 Encoder](https://github.com/agl/jbig2enc), Apache License 2.0.\n    The complexity and lack of comprehensive documentation for the JBIG2 encoding process, lead us to look at the\n    AGL JBIG2 Encoder library. At the moment of implementing our encoder it was the only Open Source JBIG2 encoder.\n    It’s a C++ based library that implements both lossless and lossy encoding methods, where most of the image\n    operations are done using DanBloomberg Leptonica library.\n\n    The core encoding processes in the UniPDF JBIG2 Encoder were based on that well documented and solid library\n\n\n* [DanBloomberg Leptonica](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica), The 2-Clause BSD License,\n    DanBloomberg Leptonica is an amazing C/C++ Open Source library. It provides raster operations, binary expansion and\n    reduction, JBIG2 component creators, correlation scoring and a lot more perfectly commented image operation functions.\n    That library was used as a very solid base for our image operation algorithms used by the JBIG2 Encoder.\n\n* [sRGB2014 - Color Profile](http://www.color.org/srgbprofiles.xalter), Copyright International Color Consortium, 2015\n    This profile is made available by the International Color Consortium, and may be copied,\n    distributed, embedded, made, used, and sold without restriction.

There are multiple respectable efforts out there that can do many useful things.\n\nIn UniDoc, we work hard to provide production quality builds taking every detail into consideration and providing excellent support to our customers.  See our [testimonials](https://unidoc.io) for example.\n\nSecurity.  We take security very seriously and we restrict access to github.com/unidoc/unipdf repository with protected branches and only the founders have access and every commit is reviewed prior to being accepted.\n\nThe profits are invested back into making unipdf better. We want to make the best possible product and in order to do that we need the best people to contribute. A large fraction of the profits made goes back into developing unipdf.  That way we have been able to get many excellent people to work and contribute to unipdf that would not be able to contribute their work for free.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are interested in contributing, please contact us.\n\n## Go Version Compatibility\n\nOfficially we support three latest Go versions, but internally we would test the build with up to five latest Go versions in our CI runner.\n\n## Support and consulting\n\nPlease email us at support@unidoc.io for any queries.\n\nIf you have any specific tasks that need to be done, we offer consulting in certain cases.\nPlease contact us with a brief summary of what you need and we will get back to you with a quote, if appropriate.\n\n## License agreement\n\nThe use of this software package is governed by the end-user license agreement \n(EULA) available at: https://unidoc.io/eula/\n"

It has a reader and a writer to\n//     read and process a PDF file based on the structured model. This serves as a basis\n//     to perform a number of numerous tasks and can be used to work with a PDF in a\n//     medium to high level interface, although it does require an understanding of the\n//     PDF format and structure.\n//\n//   - creator: The PDF creator makes it easy to create new PDFs or modify existing\n//     PDFs. It can also enable loading a template PDF, adding text/images and\n//     generating an output PDF. It can be used to add text, images, and generate text\n//     and graphical reports. It is designed with simplicity in mind, with the goal of\n//     making it easy to create reports without needing any knowledge about the PDF\n//     format or specifications.\n//\n//   - extractor: Package extractor is used for quickly extracting PDF content\n//     through a simple interface. Currently offers functionality for extracting textual\n//     content.\npackage unipdf ;"
