First, read this page (including the small print at the end).\n\n### Before you contribute\n\nBefore we can use your code, you must sign the Google Individual Contributor\nLicense Agreement (CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly\nbecause you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution\nbecomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute\nyour code. We also need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that\nyou'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents.\nYou don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for\nreview and a member has approved it, but you must do it before we can put your\ncode into our codebase. Before you start working on a larger contribution, you\nshould get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so\nthat we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it\nmuch easier to avoid frustration later on.\n\n### Code reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.\nWe use Github pull requests for this purpose.\n\n### The small print\n\nContributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than\nthe one above, the Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement.\n"

This is a multi hour workshop,\nso get ready for some intense learning!\n\nAfter going through the whole content, you will know about what tools can\nhelp you better write Go code, how to build artifacts from that code, and\nhow to understand the performance of your code once it's running.\n\nYou should be relatively familiar with Go, even though we won't be writing\nmuch code. Maybe it's time to check out the [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org).\n\nFor a shorter and sweeter version of this workshop, you can watch the video\nthat I made for a conference, and inspired me to create this workshop.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBjoTxosSys\">\n        <img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/uBjoTxosSys/0.jpg\" alt=\"Go Tooling in Action\">\n        <p>Go Tooling in Action</p>\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n## Software requirements\n\nTo go through this you will need the following:\n\n1. You have installed the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org).\n1. We will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) it's free and open source.\n1. Finally, we'll also use [delve](https://github.com/derekparker/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation), so install it now if you think you won't have good WiFi later.\n\nThe rest of the software we'll use is quick to install through `go get`, so\ndo not worry yet.\n\n## Contents\n\nThe workshop is for now composed of three independent sections:\n\n- [1: Source code management](1-source-code/README.md)\n- [2: Building artifacts from code](2-building-artifacts/README.md)\n- [3: Dynamic program analysis](3-dynamic-analysis/README.md)\n\nIn the future one more section might be added regarding monitoring of running\nsystems, but for now that topic is out of the scope of this workshop.\n\n## Issues\n\nThis workshop is very new, so some things might be missing or wrong.\n\nIf you find anything that seems broken, please file an issue. Or even better,\nsend a pull request! You will need to sign a CLA, you'll get the info once\nyou send the PR.\n\n## Resources\n\nThese are places where you can find more information for Go:\n\n- [golang.org](https://golang.org)\n- [godoc.org](https://godoc.org), where you can find the documentation for any package.\n- [The Go Programming Language Blog](https://blog.golang.org)\n\nMy favorite aspect of Go is its community, and you are now part of it too. Welcome!\n\nAs a newcomer to the Go community you might have questions or get blocked at some point.\nThis is completely normal, and we're here to help you.\nSome of the places where gophers tend to hang out are:\n\n- [The Go Forum](https://forum.golangbridge.org/)\n- #go-nuts IRC channel at [Freenode](https://freenode.net/)\n- Gophersâ€™ community on [Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/general/) (signup [here](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/) for an account).\n- [@golang](https://twitter.com/golang) and [#golang](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23golang) on Twitter.\n- [Go+ community](https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/114112804251407510571) on Google Plus.\n- [Go user meetups](https://go-meetups.appspot.com/)\n- golang-nuts [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/golang-nuts)\n- Go community [Wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just\ncode that happens to be owned by Google.\n"
