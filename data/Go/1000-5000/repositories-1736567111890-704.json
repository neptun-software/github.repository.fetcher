          "content": "# How to Contribute to Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes!\nThe goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview on how you can get involved.\n\n- [How to Contribute to Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes](#how-to-contribute-to-elastic-cloud-on-kubernetes)\n  - [Report your bugs](#report-your-bugs)\n  - [Set up your development environment](#set-up-your-development-environment)\n  - [Contribute with your code](#contribute-with-your-code)\n    - [Format your code and manage imports](#format-your-code-and-manage-imports)\n    - [Scripts](#scripts)\n    - [Tests](#tests)\n      - [Test suites](#test-suites)\n    - [Logging](#logging)\n    - [License headers](#license-headers)\n    - [Submit your changes](#submit-your-changes)\n      - [Sign the CLA](#sign-the-cla)\n      - [Prepare a Pull Request](#prepare-a-pull-request)\n    - [Backports](#backports)\n  - [Contribute to ECK documentation](#contribute-to-eck-documentation)\n  - [Design documents](#design-documents)\n\n## Report your bugs\n\nIf you find an issue, check first our [list of issues](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/issues). If your problem has not been reported yet, open a new issue, add a detailed description on how to reproduce the problem and complete it with any additional information that might help solving the issue.\n\n## Set up your development environment\n\nCheck requirements and steps in this [guide](dev-setup.md).\n\n## Contribute with your code\n\n### Format your code and manage imports\n\n1. Run `make lint` to make sure there are no lint warnings.\n2. Make sure you only have, at maximum, 3 groups in your imports:\n   - a group for packages from the standard library\n   - (optionally) a group for third parties\n   - (optionally) a group for 'local' imports (local being 'github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s')\n\n### Scripts\n\nAs most of the contributors are using macOS and Linux, make sure that scripts run on these two environments.\n\n### Tests\n\nYour contributions should pass the existing tests. You must provide new tests to demonstrate bugs and fixes.\n\n#### Test suites\n\nThere are 4 test suites:\n\n- **Unit tests** - use standard `go test` and [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) assertions. Keep them small, fast and reliable.\n\n  A good practice is to have some [table-driven tests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests), you can use [gotests](https://github.com/cweill/gotests) to quickly generate them from your code.\n\n- **Integration tests** - some tests are flagged as integration as they can take more than a few milliseconds to complete. It's usually recommended to separate them from the rest of the unit tests that run fast. Usually they include disk I/O operations, network I/O operations on a test port, or encryption computations. We also rely on the kubebuilder testing framework, that spins up etcd and the apiserver locally, and enqueues requests to a reconciliation function.\n\n- **End-to-end tests** - (e2e) allow us to test interactions between the operator and a real Kubernetes cluster.\n  They use the standard `go test` tooling. See the `test/e2e` directory. We recommend to rely primarily on unit and integration tests, as e2e tests are slow and hard to debug because they simulate real user scenarios. To run a specific e2e test, you can use something similar to `make TESTS_MATCH=TestMetricbeatStackMonitoringRecipe clean docker-build docker-push e2e-docker-build e2e-docker-push e2e-run`. This will run the e2e test with your latest commit and is very close to how it will run in CI.\n\n  A faster option is to run the operator and tests locally, with `make run` in one shell and `make e2e-local TESTS_MATCH= TestMetricbeatStackMonitoringRecipe` in another, though this does not exercise all of the same configuration (permissions etc.) that will be used in CI, so is not as thorough.\n\n- **Helm chart tests** - allows us to test helm charts. To run helm chart tests, you can use `make helm-test` command.\n\n#### Pull Request validation\n\nFor security reasons, an Elastic engineer will trigger continuous integration to run these tests and report any failures in the pull request.\n\nAll tests must pass to validate a pull request.\n\n### Logging\n\nThe operator relies on controller-runtime logging instead of golang built-in log library. It uses a type of logging called _structured logging_, log messages must not contain variables, but they can be associated with some key/value pairs.\n\nFor example, do not write:\n\n```golang\nlog.Printf(\"starting reconciliation for pod %s/%s\", podNamespace, podName)\n```\n\nBut instead write:\n\n```golang\nlogger.Info(\"starting reconciliation\", \"pod\", req.NamespacedNamed)\n```\n\nWe only use two levels: `debug` and `info`. To produce a log at the `debug` level use `V(1)` before the `Info` call:\n\n```golang\nlogger.V(1).Info(\"starting reconciliation\", \"pod\", req.NamespacedNamed)\n```\n\n### License headers\n\nWe require license headers on all files that are part of the source code.\n\n### Submit your changes\n\n#### Sign the CLA\n\nMake sure you signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.elastic.co/fr/contributor-agreement/). You only need to sign the CLA once. By signing this agreement, you give us the right to distribute your code without restriction.\n\n#### Prepare a Pull Request\n\nHere are some good practices for a good pull request:\n\n- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\n- Break your pull request into smaller PRs if it's too large.\n- Run and pass unit and integration tests with `make unit` and `make integration`.\n- Write a short and self-explanatory title.\n- Write a clear description to make the code reviewer understand what the PR is about.\n\n### Backports\n\nNew PRs should target the `main` branch, then be backported as necessary. The original PR to main should contain labels of the versions it will be backported to. The actual backport PR should be labeled `backport`. You can use https://github.com/sqren/backport to generate backport PRs easily. An example `.backportrc.json` may be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"upstream\": \"elastic/cloud-on-k8s\",\n  \"targetBranchChoices\": [{ \"name\": \"1.2\", \"checked\": true }, \"1.1\", \"1.0\"],\n  \"targetPRLabels\": [\"backport\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Contribute to ECK documentation\n\nWhether it’s a new or existing feature, make sure you document it.\nBefore you start, pull the latest files from these repos:\n\n- [elastic/cloud-on-k8s](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s): Contains the docs source files for Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes.\n- [elastic/docs](https://github.com/elastic/docs): Has the tools to publish locally your changes before committing them.\n\nTo update existing content, find the right file in the [cloud-on-k8s/docs/](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/main/docs) repo and make your change.\n\nTo create new content in a new file, add the file to [cloud-on-k8s/docs/](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/main/docs), and include it in the [index.asciidoc](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/blob/main/docs/index.asciidoc).\n\nNOTE: For searchability purposes, the file name should match the first top-level section ID of the document. For example:\n\n- File name: `apm-server.asciidoc`\n- Section ID: `[id=\"{p}-apm-server\"]`\n\nTest the doc build locally:\n\n1. Move to the directory where the [elastic/docs](https://github.com/elastic/docs) repository has been pulled\n1. Run the following command:\n\n   `./build_docs --asciidoctor --doc $GOPATH/src/github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/docs/index.asciidoc --chunk 1 --open`\n\nPush a PR for review and add the label `>docs`.\n\n## Design documents\n\nWe keep track of architectural decisions through the [architectural decision records](https://adr.github.io/). All records must apply the [Markdown Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format. We recommend to read [these documents](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/main/docs/design) to understand the technical choices that we make.\n\nThank you for taking the time to contribute.\n"

You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’\n        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n      modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0.

Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n     Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b.

Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n     License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or\n     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the\n     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\n     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\n   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\n   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\n   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under\n   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\n   skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing\n     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into\n     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\n     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\n     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\n     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\n     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\n     of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n     2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis,\n   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\n   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\n   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\n   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\n   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\n   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\n   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\n   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\n   this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\n   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\n   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\n   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\n   not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\n   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\n   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\n   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\n   counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\n   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\n   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10.

Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n      such modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4.

Effective Date\n\n     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n     become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n     distributes such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n     Contributor:\n\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n        its Contributions.\n\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\n     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to\n     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n     equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n     Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the\n        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n     License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or\n     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the\n     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\n     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\n   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\n   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\n   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under\n   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\n   skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing\n     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into\n     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\n     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\n     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\n     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\n     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\n     of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n     2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis,\n   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\n   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\n   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\n   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\n   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\n   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\n   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\n   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\n   this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\n   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\n   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\n   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\n   not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\n   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\n   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\n   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\n   counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\n   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\n   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n      such modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\n      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of\n      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be\n      attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

          "content": "# Setting up Your Development Environment\n\nThis page explains you how to set up your development environment.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore you start, install the following tools and packages:\n\n* [go](https://golang.org/dl/) (>= 1.17)\n* [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)\n* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (>= 1.14)\n* [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) (>= 2.0.0)\n* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/) (>= 19.0.0 with optional `buildx` extension for multi-arch builds)\n* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) (>= 3.2.0, preferably 3.9.x)\n* [helm unittest](https://github.com/quintush/helm-unittest#install) (only needed if developing helm charts) `helm plugin install https://github.com/quintush/helm-unittest --version 0.2.8`\n* Kubernetes distribution such as [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io), or access to a hosted Kubernetes service such as [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) or [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)\n\n### Get sources\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s.git\ncd cloud-on-k8s\n```\n\n### Check prerequisites\n\nRun `make check-requisites` to check that all dependencies are installed.\n\n## Development\n\n1. Run `make dependencies` to download the Go libraries needed to compile the project.\n2. Get a working development Kubernetes cluster. You can use:\n\n* [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/#install-minikube)\n\n  ```bash\n  make bootstrap-minikube\n  ```\n\n* [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)\n\n  Use [deployer](/hack/deployer/README.md) (see the  [deployer README](/hack/deployer/README.md#typical-usage) on how to customize which version of Kind will be used):\n\n  ```bash\n  make switch-kind bootstrap-cloud\n  ```\n\n* Cloud providers\n\n  Use [deployer](/hack/deployer/README.md) (note that some [one time configuration](/hack/deployer/README.md#typical-usage) is required):\n\n  * [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/): `make switch-gke bootstrap-cloud`\n  * [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/): `make switch-aks bootstrap-cloud`\n\n3. Docker registry\n\nThe `docker.elastic.co` registry and the `eck-dev` namespace are setup by default.\n\nIt is up to you to manage the authentication (`docker login -u $username docker.elastic.co`) to be able to push images into it.\n\nA file `.registry.env` can be created to use another Docker registry.\n\n`make switch-registry-gcr` configures this file to use Google Container Registry with:\n\n```sh\nREGISTRY = eu.gcr.io\nREGISTRY_NAMESPACE = my-gcloud-project\nE2E_REGISTRY_NAMESPACE = my-gcloud-project\n```\n\n4. Deploy the operator\n\n* `make run` to run the operator locally, or `make deploy` to deploy the operators into the configured k8s cluster.\n* `make samples` to apply a sample stack resource.\n\n### Running unit and integration tests\n\n```\nmake unit integration\n```\n\n### Running E2E tests\n\nE2E tests will run in the `e2e-mercury` and `e2e-venus` namespaces.\n\nRun `make run` to start the operator and then run `make e2e-local` in a separate shell to run the E2E tests.\n\n### Enabling APM tracing\n\nECK is instrumented with Elastic APM tracing. To run ECK locally with tracing enabled, run:\n\n```\nENABLE_TRACING=true ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL=https://<apm-server-url> ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN=<token> ELASTIC_APM_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT=false make run\n```\n\n### Development mode\n\nStarting the operator with the `--development` flag enables the development mode. The following set of flags become available for use in this mode.\n\n| Flag | Description |\n| ---- | ----------- |\n| `auto-port-forward` | Allows the operator to be run locally (outside of a Kubernetes cluster) by port-forwarding to the remote cluster. |\n| `debug-http-listen` | Address to start the debug server which provides access to pprof endpoints. Default is `localhost:6060`. |\n\n## Recommended reading\n\n* [Resources](https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io/basics/what_is_a_resource.html)\n* [Controllers](https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io/basics/what_is_a_controller.html)\n* [Controller Managers](https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io/basics/what_is_the_controller_manager.html)\n"
