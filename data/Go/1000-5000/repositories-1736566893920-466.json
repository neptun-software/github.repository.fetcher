You will create a to do list application as you advance the chapters.\n\nPlease use the `front end` folder in the `code` folder to get the index.html\nof the Tasks project and work on it while reading this tutorial.\n\n## Supporting Docs\n\nWe have a YouTube series and a fully functioning web application as supporting\ndocuments. [Tasks](http://github.com/thewhitetulip/Tasks) is the application\nwhich you'll as you read into the book\n\nIf you prefer learning by watching, [YouTube\nseries](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL41psiCma00wgiTKkAZwJiwtLTdcyEyc4).\nThe code corresponding to the YouTube series is available\n[here](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/write-webapps-in-go-video). The code\nis published as branches, each video has a particular branch.\n\n## Multiversity\n\nThis guide is a part of the\n[Multiversity](https://github.com/thewhitetulip/multiversity) initiative. The\naim is to have high quality open source tutorials along with screencasts.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome all Pull Requests, please raise an issue before starting your work!\n\n## Backstory\n\nI got feedback from a reddit user that maybe it is too early for me to start\nwriting this book. Decades ago, a young student from the University of\nHelsinki had an endless debate with Andrew Tannenbaum on comp.minix. It was\nabout monolithic kernels. Had the student listened to Andrew Tannenbaum, the\nworld probably would not have had Linux. This is the whole point of open\nsource projects, a little initiative from everyone goes a long way. I would\nlike to thank everyone who gave their suggestions on reddit and HN.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n- Through this book we want to teach how to develop web applications in Go. We\n  expect the reader to know the basics of Go but we assume the reader knows\n  **nothing** about how to write web applications.\n- The book shall comprise of chapters, if the topic is huge and doesn't fit\n  into one chapter, then we split into multiple chapters, if possible.\n- Each chapter should be split into logical parts or sections with a\n  meaningful title which'll teach the reader something.\n- Every concept should be accompanied by the Go code (if there is any), for\n  *sneak peek* type sections write the Go pseudo code, writing just the\n  necessary parts of the code and keeping everything else.\n- The code shouldn't be more than 80 characters wide because in the PDF\n  versions of the book the code is invisible.\n- *Brevity is the soul of wit*, please keep the description as small as\n     possible. This doesn't mean we skip it, but try to explain it in as\n     simple words as possible. In such cases do explain the concept.\n- In the todo list manager which we are creating, we'll strive to implement as\n  much functionality as possible to give a taste of practical Go programming\n  to the reader. In cases where we re-implement stdlib stuff, we should\n  mention it clearly.\n- The main title should have one #, sections should have 2 #'s sub section\n  should have 4 and notes should have 6 #'s (note should have a title too).\n- Multi-line code should use [syntax\n  fencing](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/),\n  single line of code can be indented using tabs or by backticks.\n\nWritten with love in India with help from the Internet.\n\n## License\n\nBook License: [CC BY-SA 3.0\nLicense](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)\n\n## Note\n\n1.
