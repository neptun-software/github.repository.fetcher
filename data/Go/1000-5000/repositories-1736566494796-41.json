operating M3.\n\n- New [M3 website](https://m3db.io/).\n- New [M3 documentation](https://m3db.io/docs).\n- Simple [M3DB configuration](https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/src/dbnode/config/m3dbnode-local-etcd.yml) and [guides](https://m3db.io/docs/quickstart/docker/).\n- M3DB [hard limits](https://m3db.io/docs/operational_guide/resource_limits/) limits for high resiliency under load.\n- Bootstrap rearchitecture, now able to boostrap hundreds of millions of recently written datapoints in minutes for reads on restart.\n- Continued focus on baseline performance release-over-release.\n\n## Features\n- **M3DB**: Namespace resolution and retention now configured dynamically via API and stored in etcd instead of being defined statically in M3Coordinator configuration.\n```\nmessage DatabaseCreateRequest {\n  // ...\n\n  // Optional aggregated namespace to create in \n  // addition to unaggregated namespace\n  AggregatedNamespace aggregated_namespace = 8;\n}\n```\n- **M3DB**: Minimal configuration file with default settings looks like:\n```\ncoordinator: {}\ndb: {}\n```\nand includes common settings such as global query limits.\n\n## Backwards Incompatible Changes\n\n### Configuration\n- **M3DB**: `db.bootstrap.bootstrappers` removed\n- **M3DB**: `db.config` nested under `db.discovery.config` (`discovery` can optionally accept different `type`s of defaults instead of a custom `config`)\n- **M3Coordinator**: `cluster.namespaces.storageMetricsType`

([#1917](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1917))\n- **M3DB**: Only trigger bootstrap during topology change if a node receives new shards. This should significantly reduce the amount of time certain topology changes (such as node removes) took when performed on larger clusters ([#1868](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1868))\n\n# 0.11.0\n\n## Migration Disclaimer\n\nVersion 0.11.0 of M3 includes further work on supporting writing data at arbitrary times (within the retention period). While most of these changes are transparent to the user in terms of functionality and performance, we had to make a change to the naming format of the files that get persisted to disk ([#1720](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1720)). This change was required to handle multiple fileset volumes per block, which is necessary after introducing \"cold flushes\" ([#1624](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1624)).\n\nThe redesign is **backwards compatible** but not **forwards compatible**. This means that you should be able upgrade your < 0.11.0 clusters to 0.11.0 with no issues, but you will not be able to downgrade without taking some additional steps.\n\n### Troubleshooting and Rolling Back\n\nIf you run into any issues with the upgrade or need to downgrade to a previous version for any reason, follow these steps:\n\n1. Stop the node that is having trouble with the upgrade or that you're trying to downgrade.\n2. Remove the filesets that include a volume index in them, e.g. this is a filename with the new volumed format: `fileset-1257890400000000000-0-data.db`, and this is the corresponding filename in the original format: `fileset-1257890400000000000-data.db`.\n3. Modify the `bootstrappers` config in the M3DB YAML file from `filesystem, commitlog, peers, uninitialized_topology` to `filesystem, peers, commitlog, uninitialized_topology`. This will force the node to bootstrap from its peers instead of the local snapshot and commitlog files it has on disk, which is important otherwise when the node restarts, it will think that it has already been bootstrapped.\n4. Turn the node back on.\n\n## Features\n\n- **M3DB**: Add cluster repair capability for non-indexed data ([#1831](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1831), [#1849](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1849),

This should prevent large spikes in the commitlog queue during snapshotting / commitlog rotation for write-heavy workloads ([#1576](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1576))\n\n# 0.8.4 (2019-04-20)\n\n## Performance\n\n- **M3DB**: Fix index query and aggregate query pooling using finalizers ([#1567](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1567))\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- **M3Query**: Fix PromQL `offset` modifier implementation ([#1561](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1561))\n- **M3DB**: Fix index flush recovery when previous index flush attempts have failed ([#1574](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1574))\n\n# 0.8.3 (2019-04-12)\n\n## Performance\n\n- **M3DB**: Bump TagLiteralLength limit to 64K ([#1552](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1552))\n\n# 0.8.2 (2019-04-11)\n\n## New Features\n\n- **M3DB**: Add Jaeger tracing to M3DB QueryIDs path ([#1506](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1506))\n\n## Performance\n\n- **M3DB**: Add postingsList caching for FieldQuery ([#1530](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1530))\n- **M3DB**: Add write & read latency histogram metrics to M3DB client and emit from M3Coordinator ([#1533](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1533))\n- **M3DB**: Persist block at retention edge when building index after peer streaming ([#1531](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1531))\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- **M3Query**: Fixed a bug that could cause a panic when converting queries ([#1546](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1546))\n\n# 0.8.1 (2019-04-02)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- **M3DB**: Fixed a bug that would sometimes prevent successfully retrieved time series data from being loaded into the cache.\n- **M3DB**: Fixed a bug where an error was not being properly logged.\n\n# 0.8.0 (2019-03-29)\n\n## Migration Disclaimer\n\nVersion 0.8.0 of M3 switches M3DB to use file descriptors and the Read() system call for reading time series data files instead of mmaps.\nThis should improve read latency and memory utilization for some workloads, particularly those in which the amount of data on disk vastly exceeds the amount of memory on the system.\nThis changes also enables the ability to increase the fetch concurrency past the default value.\n\nAs a result of this change, M3DB will allocate significantly less mmaps, but will create a corresponding amount of file descriptors.\n\nOperators may need to tune their kernel configuration to allow a higher number of open file descriptors. Please follow our [Kernel Configuration Guide](https://docs.m3db.io/operational_guide/kernel_configuration/) for more details.\n\n## New Features\n\n- **M3DB**: Add dedicated aggregation endpoint ([#1463](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1463), [#1502](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1502), [#1483](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1483))\n\n## Performance\n\n- **M3DB**: Use Seek() and Read() APIs for index/data files instead of mmap + share expensive seeker resources among seekers ([#1421](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1421))\n- **M3Query**: Tag completion endpoints (Prometheus (`match[]`, `/{foo}/series`), and Graphite (`find`) endpoints) now use the new dedicated aggregation endpoint ([#1481](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1481))\n\n# 0.7.3 (2019-03-22)\n\n## New Features\n\n- **M3DB**: Add an AllQuery index query type ([#1478](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1478))\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- **M3DB**: Fix to annotation pooling ([#1476](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1476))\n- **M3Coordinator**: Only panics log a stacktrace rather than expected errors ([#1480](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1480))\n\n## Performance\n\n- **M3DB**: Use a single results object for merging postings lists across blocks, rather than creating a result per block and discarding them immediately thereafter. This should reduce memory utilization significantly for queries that look back over a large number of blocks ([#1474](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1474))\n- **M3DB**: Improvement to applying back pressure on writes with a full commitlog, which should improve M3DB's ability to apply back pressure under load and recover quickly after being overwhelmed with traffic. ([#1482](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1482))\n\n# 0.7.2 (2019-03-15)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- **All Binaries**: Fix LD flags in release so that version, branch, build date, etc are packaged into the binary properly.\n\n# 0.7.1 (2019-03-15)\n\n## New Features\n\n- **M3Query**: Add per-query cost accounting to allow fine-grained controls on datapoint limits to Prometheus and Graphite style queries ([#1207](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1207)) ([#1449](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1449))\n- **M3Query**: Add optional pickled return type for Graphite render endpoint ([#1446](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1446))\n- **M3Query**: Drop NaNs from query results ([#1458](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1458))\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- **M3DB**: Fix bug in postings list caching which could cause incorrect results on queries ([#1461](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1461))\n\n# 0.7.0 (2019-03-12)\n\n## Migration Disclaimer\n\nVersion 0.7.0 of M3 includes a redesign of the snapshotting and commitlog components ([#1384](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1384) among others). This redesign was critical to improve M3DB's consistency guarantees, reduce the amount of disk space that is wasted by commitlogs, and enable future feature development to support writing data at arbitrary times.\n\nThe redesign is **backwards compatible** but not **forwards compatible**. This means that you should be able upgrade your < 0.7.0 clusters to 0.7.0 with no issues, but you will not be able to downgrade without taking some additional steps. Note that the first bootstrap after the upgrade may take longer than usual, but subsequent bootstraps should be just as fast as they used to be, or even faster.\n\n### Troubleshooting and Rolling Back\n\nIf you run into any issues with the upgrade or need to downgrade to a previous version for any reason, follow these steps:\n\n1. Stop the node that is having trouble with the upgrade or that you're trying to downgrade.\n2. Modify the `bootstrappers` config in the M3DB YAML file from `filesystem, commitlog, peers, uninitialized_topology` to `filesystem, peers, commitlog, uninitialized_topology`. This will force the node to bootstrap from its peers instead of the local snapshot and commitlog files it has on disk, bypassing any issues related to file incompatibility between versions.\n3. Turn the node back on and wait for it to finish bootstrapping and snapshotting. Once everything looks stable, change the config back to `filesystem, commitlog, peers, uninitialized_topology` so that the next time the node is restarted it will default to using the snapshot and commitlog files.\n\n## New Features\n\n- **M3DB**: Restructuring of commitlog and snapshotting feature as described above ([#1384](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1384))\n- **M3DB**: Obtain a lock on data directory on startup ([#1376](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1376))\n- **M3Coordinator**: Add support for zone / environment override headers in namespace APIs so multiple M3DB clusters can be administered from the same M3Coordinator instance / etcd cluster ([#1427](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1427))\n- **M3Query**: Add Jaeger tracing to M3Query, and mechanism to plugin custom opentracing implementations ([#1321](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1321))\n- **M3nsch**: Add basic Grafana dashboard showing success rates and latencies ([#1401](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1401))\n- **M3nsch**: Support generating new unique metrics ([#1397](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1397))\n\n## Performance\n\n- **M3DB**: Optimize OStream implementation which reduces CPU synchronization for each write. Should result in modest improvement in load average for metrics workloads and a massive improvement in load average for any workload using large annotations ([#1399](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1399), [#1437](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1437))\n- **M3DB**: Prevent duplicate writes from being written to the commitlog ([#1375](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1375))\n- **M3DB**: Construct RPC service once and share it with TChannel and HTTP servers to prevent pools from being initialized multiple times reducing memory footprint ([#1420](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1420))\n- **M3Query**: Add LRU cache for query conversion. Should help dashboards with expensive regex query in particular ([#1398](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1398))\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- **M3Coordinator**: Better error responses from namespace APIs when namespace is unknown ([#1412](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1412))\n- **M3Query**: Fix panic in temporal functions ([#1429](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1429))\n\n# 0.6.1 (2019-02-20)\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- **M3Coordinator**: Fix to panic caused by generating ID for series with no tags ([#1392](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1392))\n- **M3Coordinator**: Fix to panic caused by reading placement when none available instead of return 404 ([#1391](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1391))\n\n# 0.6.0 (2019-02-19)\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n- **M3Coordinator**: ID generation scheme must be explicitly defined in configs ([Set \"legacy\" if unsure, further information on migrating to 0.6.0](https://docs.m3db.io/how_to/query/#migration)) ([#1381](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1381))\n\n## New Features\n\n- **M3DB** (Config): Simplify M3 config options ([#1371](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1371))\n- **M3Coordinator**: Improve database creation API ([#1350](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1350))\n- **M3Query**: Add quantile_over_time and histogram_quantile Prometheus functions ([#1367](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1367), [#1373](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1373))\n- **Documentation**: Additional documentation for namespace setup and configuration, etcd, and M3Coordinator ID generations schemes ([#1350](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1350), [#1354](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1354), [#1381](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1381), [#1385](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1385))\n\n## Performance\n\n- **M3DB** (Index): Add posting list cache that should result in a massive improvement for M3DB query performance for most workloads ([#1370](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1370))\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- **M3DB** (Index): Fix race condition in index query ([#1356](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1356))\n- **M3Coordinator**: Fix panic responder which was previously not reporting query panics to users ([#1353](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1353))\n- **M3Query**: Fix bug in calculating temporal (over_time) functions ([#1271](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1271))\n\n# 0.5.0 (2019-02-03)\n\n## New Features\n\n- **M3Coordinator**: Add [Graphite support](https://docs.m3db.io/integrations/grafana/) in the form of Carbon ingestion (with configurable aggregation and storage policies), as well as direct and Grafana based Graphite querying support ([#1309](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1309), [#1310](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1310), [#1308](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1308), [#1319](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1319), [#1318](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1318), [#1327](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1327), [#1328](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1328))\n- **M3Coordinator**: Add tag completion API ([#1175](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1175))\n- **M3Coordinator**: Add new opt-in ID generation function that will never collide ([#1286](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1286))\n- **M3DB**: Add [endpoint](https://m3db.io/openapi/#operation/databaseConfigSetBootstrappers) for setting database bootstrapers dynamically([#1239](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1239))\n\n## Performance\n\n- **M3DB** (Index) Replace usage of slow \"memory segment\" for index segment with immutable F.S.Ts that are constantly being generated in the foreground as series are being inserted. Significantly reduces query latency (10x+) for some types of workloads that make heavy use of regex ([#1197](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1197))\n- **M3DB**: (Index) Add support for concurrent index block queries (improves performance of queries that look back many blocks ([#1195](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1195))\n- **M3DB**: (Index) Improve pooling configuration of one of the index array pools to prevent (almost) unbounded growth over time for certain workloads ([#1254](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1254))\n- **M3DB**: (Index) Use only one roaring bitmap library (Pilosa), and upgrade to version of Pilosa with our upstreammed `UnionInPlace` improvements that reduces memory consumption of expensive queries by over a factor of 10x ([#1238](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1238)), fixes: [#1192](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1192)\n- **M3DB**: (Index) Don't use object pool for allocating long-lived arrays of tag slices which reduces steady-state memory consumption because the default size is 16 which is much bigger than the number of tags most metrics have ([#1300](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1300))\n- **M3DB**: Auto-calculate size of WriteBatchPool based on commitlog queue size and improve chance of batch being returned to pool ([#1236](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1236))\n- **M3DB**: Don't allow msgpack library to allocate \\*bufio.Reader (reduces allocations) and mmap bloomfilters and index summaries as files instead of anonymously so they can be paged out by the O.S if necessary ([#1289](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1289))\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- **M3DB**: Fix bug where namespace-level configuration \"writes to commitlog\" was not respected ([#1232](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1232))\n- **M3DB**: Improve how M3DB handles durability during topology changes. Previously, a new node that was added to an M3DB cluster would not be completely durable (able to recover all data from disk) for a few minutes after the node join completed even though it marked all its shards as available. Now, newly added M3DB nodes will never mark their shards as available until they are completely durable ([#1183](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1183)). Also, Make M3DB health check not return success until node is bootstrapped AND durable, not just bootstrapped. This makes automated operations (like those performed by the Kubernetes operator or various scripts) much safer ([#1287](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1287))\n- **M3DB**: Make it possible to safely replace/add/remove M3DB seed nodes by exposing etcd configuration ([#1339](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1339))\n- **M3Coordinator**: Fix bug in database create API so it respects number of shards

propagate M3DB fetch timeout from config instead of using default value ([#1342](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1342))\n\n# 0.4.8 (2018-10-20)\n\n- **Coordinator**: Reduce log spam for high latency requests ([#1164](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1164))\n- **Coordinator**: Add support for replace API for db nodes ([#1162](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1162))\n- **Coordinator**: Add sort and sort_desc and linear regression promql functions ([#1104](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1104), [#1063](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1063))\n- **DB**: Emit logs when process limits are

error not displayed in logs ([#1089](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1089))\n- FIX **DB**: Various changes that improve M3DBs resiliency to corrupt commitlog files during bootstrap and cleanup as well as its resiliency to corrupt fileset files ([#1065](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1065), [#1066](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1066), [#1086](https://github.com/m3db/m3/pull/1086))\n- FIX

          "content": "# Development Guide\n\nM3 is a large, active codebase. This guide is for all potential code\ncontributors, designed to make it easier to get started with contributing to M3.\n\n## Setup Development Environment\n\nFork <https://github.com/m3db/m3> to your own user or org account on GitHub.\n\nClone the fork:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/m3db\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/m3db\ngit clone git@github.com:<fork_user_or_org>/m3.git\n```\n\n**Note**: You must push all commits/branches/etc to the fork, not to the upstream repository.\n\nVerify that `git clone` set the repository's upstream:\n\n```shell\n$ git remote -v\norigin  git@github.com:<fork_user_or_org>/m3.git (fetch)\norigin  git@github.com:<fork_user_or_org>/m3.git (push)\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncd m3\nmake install-vendor-m3\n```\n\nYou can build each M3 component using `make` and the relevant task\n\n-   A single combined database and coordinator node ideal for local development: `make m3dbnode`\n-   An M3 Coordinator node: `make m3coordinator`\n-   An M3 Aggregator node: `make m3aggregator`\n-   An M3 Query node: `make m3query`\n\n<!-- TODO: Why? What is this? Why do I need it? -->\n\n## Running the M3 Stack Locally\n\nFollow the instructions in [this README][local-readme].\n\n[local-readme]: ./scripts/development/m3_stack/README.md\n\n## Updating Mocks and Generated Files\n\n<!-- TODO: What might these be? -->\n\nIf changes require updates to mocks or other generated files, make sure to\nupdate those files. There are `make` targets to help with generation:\n\n-   Mocks: `make mock-gen`\n-   Protobuf: `make proto-gen` (Requires Docker)\n-   Thrift: `make thrift-gen` (Requires Docker)\n\nDon't forget to account for changes to generated files in tests.\n\nYou can build mocks/protos etc. for a single component with:\n\n```\nmake mock-gen-<component>\n\ne.g. \nmake mock-gen-aggregator\n```\n\n### Adding new mocks\n\n`mockgen` statements are centralized in a single generate.go file per component. The convention is:\n\n`src/<component>/generated/mocks/generate.go`\n\ne.g. for the aggregator \n`src/aggregator/generated/mocks/generate.go`\n\n### Adding new proto definitions\n\nProto definitions should be placed in:\n\n```\nsrc/<component>/generated/proto`\n```\n\n## Scoping Pull Requests\n\nInspired by Phabricator's article about\n[Recommendations on Revision Control][phab-one-idea], and particularly\nbecause pull requests tend to be squash-merged, try to keep PRs focused\non one idea (or the minimal number of ideas for the change to be viable).\n\nThe advantages of smaller PRs are:\n\n-   Quicker to write + quicker to review = faster iteration\n-   Easier to spot errors\n-   Less cognitive overhead (and net time invested) for reviewers due to\n    reduced scope\n-   Avoids scope creep\n-   Clearly establishes that all parts of the PR are related\n\nBecause of this, contributors are encouraged to keep PRs as small as\npossible. Given that this does introduce some developer overhead (e.g.\nneeding to manage more PRs), _how_ small is unspecified; reviewers\ncan request breaking PRs down further as necessary, and contributors\nshould work with reviewers to find the right balance.\n\n[phab-one-idea]: https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabflavor/article/recommendations_on_revision_control/#one-idea-is-one-commit\n\n## Testing Changes\n\nM3 has an extensive test suite to ensure that we're able to validate changes. You can find more notes about the testing strategies employed in [TESTING][TESTING.md].\n\nWhile the CI suite runs all tests before allowing the merging of pull requests\n, developers should test their changes during development and before\npushing updates.\n\nTo test code, use `go test` from the root directory:\n\n```shell\ngo test -v ./src/...\n```\n\nThe time required to run the entire suite has increased significantly. We recommend only running tests for both (1) any packages with changes and (2) any packages that\nimport the changed packages. An example of this is:\n\n```bash\nchanged=$(git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD | xargs -I {} dirname {} | sort | uniq)\nfor pkg in $changed; do\n  affected=$(grep -r \"$pkg\" ./src | cut -d: -f1 | grep -v mock | xargs -I{} dirname {} | sort | uniq)\n  go test -v -race \"./$pkg\" $affected\ndone\n```\n\nContributors are free to do whatever due diligence that they feel helps them to\nbe most productive. Our only request is that contributors don't use CI jobs as a first-pass filter to determine whether a change is sane or not.\n\nOnce tests are passing locally, push to a new remote branch to create a pull\nrequest, or push to an existing branch to update a pull request. If the CI\nsuite reports any errors, attempt to reproduce failures locally and fix them\nbefore continuing.\n\nFor larger or more intensive tests (e.g. \"big\" unit tests, integration tests),\nyou may need additional build tags to scope the tests down to a smaller\nsubset, for example:\n\n```shell\n# example integration test\n$ go test ./integration -tags integration -run TestIndexBlockRotation -v\n\n# example big unit test\n$ go test -tags big ./services/m3dbnode/main -run TestIndexEnabledServer -v\n```\n\n## Code Review\n\nPlease follow the following guidelines when submitting or reviewing pull\nrequests:\n\n-   Merging is blocked on approval by 1 or more users with write access. We\n    recommend 2+ for large, complex, or nuanced changes.\n-   Pull requests should contain clear descriptions and context per the\n    pull request template.\n-   The [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)][GOVERNANCE.md] must approve breaking changes  \n    under the current versioning guarantees (see [COMPATIBILITY][COMPATIBILITY.md]).\n-   You should follow the [STYLEGUIDE][STYLEGUIDE.md] to the extent reasonable\n    within the scope of the pull request.\n-   You should validate changed codepaths should by unit tests that cover at least one\n    nominal case and one error case.\n-   Pull requests are only merged with a green build. Don't merge with\n    build failures, even if they're known and unrelated.\n-   Flaky or otherwise unreliable CI failures count as hard failures. Commit fixes\n    or skips for flaky tests or other failures first.\n\nYour pull request is most likely to be accepted if it:\n\n-   Includes tests for new functionality.\n-   Follows the guidelines in [Effective\n    Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and the [Go team's common code\n    review comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).\n-   Has a [good commit\n    message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).\n-   It prefixes the name of the pull request with the component you are updating in the format \"[component] Change title\" (for example \"[dbnode] Support out of order writes\").\n\n## Updating the CHANGELOG\n\nAfter a pull request is merged, summarize significant changes in the\n[CHANGELOG][CHANGELOG.md]. Since the you don't know the PR number ahead of time, \ndo this as a subsequent commit after the merged PR (though you can prepare the \nCHANGELOG PR in tandem with the referenced PR).\n\nThe format of the CHANGELOG entry should be:\n\n```text\n- TYPE **COMPONENT**: Description (#PR_NUMBER)\n```\n\nOmit the `TYPE` should if it's a feature. If the change isn't a\nfeature, `TYPE` should be either `FIX` or `PERF`. Add new types of changes\nto this document before used if you can't categorize them by the\nexisting types.\n\nAdd new CHANGELOG entries to the current \"unreleased\" section at\nthe top of the CHANGELOG as long as they're within the scope of that potential\nversion. If no unreleased section exists, add one using the\nappropriate proposed semver. If an unreleased section exists but the new change\nrequires a different semver change (e.g. the unreleased version is a patch\nversion bump, but the new change requires a minor version bump), update the version\non the existing section. See [COMPATIBILITY][COMPATIBILITY.md]\nfor more information on versioning.\n\nAn example CHANGELOG addition:\n\n```text\n# 0.4.5 (unreleased)\n\n- FIX **DB**: Index data race in FST Segment reads (#938)\n```\n\n## Cutting a Release\n\n1.  Check you have a GitHub API access token with the `repo` scope\n2.  Checkout the commit you want to release (all releases must be on master)\n3.  Create a tag with the version you want to release\n    -   E.g. `git tag -a v0.7.0 -m \"v0.7.0\"`\n    -   Read [COMPATIBILITY][COMPATIBILITY.md] for semver information.\n4.  Push the tag\n    -   E.g. `git push origin v0.7.0`\n5.  Run `make GITHUB_TOKEN=<GITHUB_API_ACCESS_TOKEN> release`\n6.  Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and commit it to master\n7.  Copy and paste the text from [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) into the release notes [on GitHub][releases].\n\n[CHANGELOG.md]: https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n\n[COMPATIBILITY.md]: https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.md\n\n[GOVERNANCE.md]: https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md\n\n[STYLEGUIDE.md]: https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md\n\n[TESTING.md]: https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/TESTING.md\n\n[m3db.io]: https://m3db.io/\n\n[releases]: https://github.com/m3db/m3/releases\n"

          "content": "# Documentation Guide\n\nM3 is a large and complex project, and any help you can offer to explain it better is most welcome. If you have a suggestion for the documentation M3 welcomes it, and documentation pull requests follow the same process as [code contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThe rest of this document explains how to setup the documentation locally and the structure of the content.\n\n## Setup Documentation Locally\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThe M3 documentation uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go. [Find installation instructions in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).\n\nIf you also want to run and serve the M3 documentation, you need the custom theme, [Victor](https://github.com/chronosphereio/victor). Clone or download it into the same directory as the M3 codebase.\n\nTo run some tests and test the production build steps (this doesn't run M3 itself), you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com).\n\n## Folder Structure\n\nHugo hosts the M3 documentation, website, and Open API spec.\n\n### Website\n\nThe website is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the _site/static_ folder. Edit those files to make any changes.\n\n### Open API Docs\n\nHugo hosts the Open API spec from the _site/static/openapi_ folder. To make changes to the spec, edit the _spec.yml_ file in _src/query/generated/assets_, and a CI job generates the file that Hugo hosts automatically.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe _site/config_ folder has configuration for Hugo, split into three folders:\n\n-   A default  _config.toml_ file in _site/config/\\_default_\n-   Overridden configuration for development and production environments in _site/config/development_ and _site/config/production_ respectively.\n\n### Theme Overrides\n\nThe _site/layouts_ folder adds a several changes and overridden files to the Victor theme used by the M3 documentation.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe _site/content_ folder contains the documentation files, organized by folders that match the paths for URLs. The _includes_ folder is a special folder not served as part of the documentation and files used by other files.\n\n#### Theme\n\nThe M3 documentation uses its own (open source) theme, Victor. You can read all the features that theme provides in [the repository for Victor](https://github.com/chronosphereio/victor).\n\nVictor is a theme based on Hugo modules, [read more in the Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/) about how to use and update it.\n\n#### Shortcodes\n\nThe M3 documentation adds the following extra shortcodes:\n\n-   `{{% apiendpoint %}}` - Combines the values of `Params.api.localCordinator` + `Params.api.apiEndpoint` as defined in the site configuration to output the base API endpoint for M3 running on a localhost.\n-   `{{% docker-version %}}` - Outputs the value of `Params.releases.docker` as defined in the site configuration to output the consistent current Docker release.\n-   `{{% now %}}` - Outputs the current Unix timestamp to allow for up to date timestamps in code examples.\n\n## Running Documentation\n\nAs noted in the prerequisites section, if you want to run the documentation locally to see how your edits look with `hugo server`, you need to have the Victor theme in the same parent directory as the M3 codebase, as `hugo server` runs in Hugo's \"development\" mode (and matches _site/config/development/config.toml_).\n\nThis does mean that as you make changes to the theme or documentation, it refreshes automatically in the browser preview. Sometimes Hugo doesn't refresh included files, so you may need to restart the server process.\n\n## Testing Documentation\n\nThe M3 documentation has a number of tests that need to pass before a pull request is merged to master and deployed. These include:\n\n-   Link checking with htmltest\n\nTo run them you need Docker installed and running, and at the top level of the M3 project, run `make clean install-vendor-m3 docs-test`. If the test is successful you see green text, if not, htmltest tells you which links in which pages you need to fix.\n\n## Building Documentation\n\nThere are a couple of different ways to build the documentation depending what you want to do.\n\n- If you want to build only the most up-to-date version of the docs, you can use `hugo` to build.\n- If you want to build all versions of the docs using Hugo run in Docker (this is what CI does to test the documentation). From the top level of the project, run `make docs-build`.\n- If you want to build all versions of the docs with a system-installed version of Hugo (this is what Netlify does to build and serve the documentation). From the top level of the project, run `make site-build`.\n\n## Creating a New Documentation Version\n\nM3 releases versions with some slight changes to documentation for each one which users can access from the drop down menu under the right hand navigation.\n\nArchiving a version of the documentation is a slightly complex process as Hugo doesn't natively support versioning.\n\n1.  Add the new version and path to _site/config/production/config.toml_ in the format:\n\n    ```toml\n    [[params.versions]]\n      version = \"{versionNumber}\"\n      url = \"/v{versionNumber}/docs\"\n    ```\n2.  Add the `/v{versionNumber}` path before each `{{ .RelPermalink}}` in the two anchor tags in _site/layouts/partials/navbar.html_\n3.  Make sure the Victor theme is at least version 0.2.11\n4.  Create and tag the commits with the name \"docs/v{versionNumber}\"\n5.  Switch to a new branch that will add the new version to the master branch\n6.  Add the new version to _site/config/production/config.toml_\n7.  Also add the new version to _site/config/production/config.toml_ in every pre-existing docs version tag\n8.  Switch back to the branch from step 5\n9.  Test everything locally with `make site-build`\n10. Push the new tag to the remote repository\n"

It is not essential for using M3DB.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe below is a simplified version of the [M3 quickstart guide](https://m3db.io/docs/quickstart/docker/), and we suggest you read that for more details.\n\n1.  Start a Container\n\n```shell\ndocker run -p 7201:7201 -p 7203:7203 --name m3db -v $(pwd)/m3db_data:/var/lib/m3db quay.io/m3db/m3dbnode:v1.0.0\n```\n\n2.  Create a Placement and Namespace\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:7201/api/v1/database/create -d '{\n  \"type\": \"local\",\n  \"namespaceName\": \"default\",\n  \"retentionTime\": \"12h\"\n}' | jq .\n```\n\n3.  Ready a Namespace\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:7201/api/v1/services/m3db/namespace/ready -d '{\n  \"name\": \"default\"\n}' | jq .\n```\n\n4.

          "content": "# M3 Coding Styleguide\n\nM3's umbrella coding style guide is Uber's [Go Style Guide][uber-guide]. This\ndocument is maintained as a superset of that guide, capturing any substantive,\nintended departures from Uber's coding style. Where possible, code should follow\nthese guidelines to ensure consistent style and coding practices across the\ncodebase.\n\nAbove all else, this guide is intended to be a point of reference rather than\na sacred text. We maintain a style guide as a pragmatic tool that can be used to\navoid common issues and normalize code across many authors and the Go community.\n\nNew code should follow the style guide by default, preferring guidelines\nestablished here or in Uber's guide over any conflicting, pre-existing\nprecedents in the M3 codebase. Ultimately, the hope is that the codebase\nincrementally moves closer to the style guide with each change.\n\nSince the M3 monorepo predated this style guide, reviewers should not expect\ncontributors to make unrelated or unreasonable style-based changes as part of\npull requests. However, when changing code that could reasonably be updated\nto follow the guide, we prefer that those changes adopt the guidelines to avoid\nsustaining or increasing technical debt. See DEVELOPMENT.md for more detail on\nchanges involving style.\n\n[uber-guide]: https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md\n\n## Linting\n\nMany guidelines are flagged by `go vet` or the other configured linters (see\n[.golangci.yml][.golangci.yml]). Wherever possible, we prefer to use tooling to\nenforce style to remove subjectivity or ambiguity. Linting is also a blocking\nbuild for merging pull requests.\n\n[.golangci.yml]: https://github.com/m3db/m3/blob/master/.golangci.yml\n\n## Template\n\nWhen adding to this guide, use the following template:\n\n~~~\n### Short sentence about the guideline.\n\nClearly (and succinctly) articulate the guideline and its rationale, including\nany problematic counter-examples. Be intentional when using language like\n\"always\", \"never\", etc, instead using words like \"prefer\" and \"avoid\" if the\nguideline isn't a hard rule. If it makes sense, also include example code:\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>\n\n```go\ngoodExample := false\n```\n\n</td><td>\n\n```go\ngoodExample := true\n```\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\nDescription of bad code.\n</td><td>\nDescription of good code.\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n~~~\n\n## Guidelines\n\n### Export types carefully.\n\nTypes should only be exported if they must be used by multiple packages. This\napplies also to adding new packages: a new package should only be added if it\nwill be imported by multiple packages. If a given type or package will only\ninitially be imported in one package, define those type(s) in that importing\npackage instead.\n\nIn general, it's harder to reduce surface area than it is to incrementally\nincrease surface area, and the former is a breaking change while the latter is\noften not.\n\n### Treat flaky tests like consistent failures.\n\nFlaky tests add noise to code health signals, reduce trust in tests to be\nrepresentative of code behavior. Worse, flaky tests can be either false positive\nor false negative, making it especially unclear as to whether or not a given\ntest passing or failing is good or bad. All of these reduce overall velocity\nand/or reliability.\n\nAll tests discovered to be flaky should be immediately result in either (a) the\ntest being skipped because it is unreliable, or (b) master being frozen until\nthe test is fixed and proven to no longer be flaky.\n\n### Do not expose experimental package types in non-experimental packages.\n\nA package is only able to guarantee a level of maturity/stability that is the\nlowest common denominator of all of its composing or transitively exported\ntypes. Given a hypothetical scenario:\n\n```go\npackage foo\n\ntype Bar {\n  Baz xfoo.Baz\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the stability of `foo.Bar` is purportedly guaranteed by package\n`foo` being non-experimental, but since it transitively exposes `xfoo.Baz` as\npart of `foo.Bar`, either (a) `xfoo.Baz` must implicitly adhere to versioning\ncompatibility guarantees or (b) `foo` can no longer be considered stable,\nas any breaking change to `xfoo.Baz` will break `foo`.\n\nThis is spiritually similar to the\n[Avoid Embedding Types In Public Structs][avoid-embedding-types] guidance, in\nthat it bleeds implementation and compatibility details in an inappropriate way.\n\nThis guidance also applies to any cases in which `internal` packages are used:\nany `internal` type is essentially the same as an unexported type, meaning that\nthat type is only implicitly available to users.\n\n[avoid-embedding-types]: https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md#avoid-embedding-types-in-public-structs\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>\n\n```go\ntype NewConnectionFn func(\n    channelName string, addr string, opts Options,\n) (xclose.SimpleCloser, rpc.TChanNode, error)\n```\n\n</td><td>\n\n```go\ntype NewConnectionFn func(\n    channelName string, addr string, opts Options,\n) (io.Closer, rpc.TChanNode, error)\n\n// or\n\ntype SimpleCloser = func()\n\ntype NewConnectionFn func(\n    channelName string, addr string, opts Options,\n) (SimpleCloser, rpc.TChanNode, error)\n```\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n`xclose.SimpleCloser` is part of `x/close`, an experimental package, but is\ndirectly exposed as part of `src/dbnode/client.NewConnectionFn`.\n\n</td><td>\n\nThe canonical `io.Closer` is used instead, or a type alias representing\n`xclose.SimpleCloser` is used instead. Both options prevent leaking experimental\npackages as part of non-experimental library APIs.\n\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n"

These allow us to specify input generators,\nand ensure the invariants expected on the system hold.\n\n[gopter]: https://godoc.org/github.com/leanovate/gopter\n\nThese come in two flavours:\n- Vanilla property tests: used when we're testing `pure` functions (i.e. side-effect free).\n- System under test: used when we're testing stateful systems. The allow generation of input state,\n  and the methods use to transition the state of the system.\n\nThese are all run by the CI for every push, with race detection enabled, and code coverage within the package\nbeing tested.\n\n(3) Big Unit Tests\nThese are a specialized version of the unit tests that are marked with the build tag `big`. They are heavier weight\nunit tests for which we disable race detection.\n\nThese are all run by the CI for every push, with race detection disabled, and code coverage measured across all\nm3db packages.\n\n(4) Integration tests\nThese tests are heavier weight tests that spin up one or more m3db DB's within a single process and test\ninteractions with each other, and other components (e.g. etcd, read/write quorum).\n\nThese are all run by the CI for every push, with race detection disabled, and code coverage measured across all\nm3db packages.\n\n(5) DTests\nTODO\n\n"

What service is experiencing the issue? (M3Coordinator, M3DB, M3Aggregator, etc)\n2. What is the configuration of the service? Please include any YAML files, as well as namespace / placement configuration (with any sensitive information anonymized if necessary).\n3. How are you using the service? For example, are you performing read/writes to the service via Prometheus, or are you using a custom script?\n4. Is there a reliable way to reproduce the behavior? If so, please provide detailed instructions.\n\n## Performance issues\n\nIf the issue is performance related, please provide the following information along with a description of the issue that you're experiencing:\n\n1. What service is experiencing the performance issue? (M3Coordinator, M3DB, M3Aggregator, etc)\n2. Approximately how many datapoints per second is the service handling?\n3. What is the approximate series cardinality that the series is handling in a given time window? I.E How many unique time series are being measured?\n4. What is the hardware configuration (number CPU cores, amount of RAM, disk size and types, etc) that the service is running on? Is the service the only process running on the host or is it colocated with other software?\n5. What is the configuration of the service? Please include any YAML files, as well as namespace / placement configuration (with any sensitive information anonymized if necessary).\n6. How are you using the service? For example, are you performing read/writes to the service via Prometheus, or are you using a custom script?\n\nIn addition to the above information, CPU and heap profiles are always greatly appreciated.\n\n### CPU / Heap Profiles\n\nCPU and heap profiles are critical to helping us debug performance issues. All our services run with the [net/http/pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/) server enabled by default.\n\nInstructions for obtaining CPU / heap profiles for various services are below, please attach these profiles to the issue whenever possible.\n\n#### M3Coordinator\n\nCPU\n`curl <HOST_NAME>:<PORT(default 7201)>/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=5 > m3coord_cpu.out`\n\nHeap\n`curl <HOST_NAME>:<PORT(default 7201)>/debug/pprof/heap > m3coord_heap.out`\n\n#### M3DB\n\nCPU\n`curl <HOST_NAME>:<PORT(default 9004)>/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=5 > m3db_cpu.out`\n\nHeap\n`curl <HOST_NAME>:<PORT(default 9004)>/debug/pprof/heap -> m3db_heap.out`\n\n### M3DB Grafana Dashboard Screenshots\n\nIf the service experiencing performance issues is M3DB and you're monitoring it using Prometheus, any screenshots you could provide using [this](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/8126-m3db-node-details/) dashboard would be helpful."
