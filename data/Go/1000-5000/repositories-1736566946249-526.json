We appreciate your help!\n\n## Filing issues\n\nWhen [filing an issue](https://golang.org/issue/new), make sure to answer these five questions:\n\n1.  What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?\n2.  What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\n3.  What did you do?\n4.  What did you expect to see?\n5.  What did you see instead?\n\nGeneral questions should go to the [golang-nuts mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts) instead of the issue tracker.\nThe gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.\n\n## Contributing code\n\nPlease read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html)\nbefore sending patches.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the Go source files are distributed under\nthe BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.\n"
