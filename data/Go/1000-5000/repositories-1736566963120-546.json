Despite this, [we](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge/graphs/contributors) strived to maintain the project with our personal resources as best as possible. However, we've reached a point where we can't ensure the same level of dedication.\n\nThe core team will only look into issues in our spare time, which means slower response times. We welcome pull requests, but please anticipate significant delays in reviewing and merging.\n\nMoreover, please consider using Gauge only if you're prepared to adopt and support it fully on your own. With our shift to community-driven maintenance, primary responsibility will fall onto individual users and contributors.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding, contributions, and continued support.\n\n## Contributing to Gauge\n\nContributions to Gauge are welcome and appreciated. Coding is definitely not the only way you can contribute to Gauge. There are many valuable ways to contribute to the product and to help the growing Gauge community.\n\nPlease read this document to understand the process for contributing.\n\n## Different ways to contribute\n\n* You can [report an issue](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge/issues) you found\n* Help us [test Gauge](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-tests) by adding to our existing automated tests\n* Help someone get started with Gauge on [our discussion forum](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge/discussions)\n* Contribute [to our blog](https://gauge.org/blog/) \n* Add to our [set of examples](https://docs.gauge.org/examples.html) to help someone new to Gauge get started easily\n* Help us improve [our documentation](https://github.com/getgauge/docs.gauge.org)\n* Contribute code to Gauge! \n\nAll repositories are hosted on GitHub. Gauge’s core is written in Golang but plugins are, and can be, written in any popular language. Pick up any pending feature or bug, big or small, then send us a pull request. Even fixing broken links is a big, big help!\n\n## How do I start contributing\n\nThere are issues of varying levels across all Gauge repositories. All issues that need to be addressed are tagged as _'Help Needed'_. One easy way to get started is to pick a small bug to fix. These have been tagged as _'Easy Picks'_.\n\nIf you need help in getting started with contribution, feel free to reach out on [Discussions](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge/discussions)\n\n### Gauge Core v/s Plugins\n\nGauge Core is a project that has features that would reflect across all Gauge use cases. These features are typically agnostic of the user's choice of implementation language.\n\nPlugins are meant to do something specific. These could be adding support for a new language, or have a new report etc. So, depending on where you see your contribution fit, please focus on the respective repository.\n\n\n### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)\n\nGauge and it's plugins use a mechanism called a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) popularized by The Linux Foundation. The DCO is a legally binding statement that asserts that you are the creator of your contribution, and that you license the work under the Apache License Version 2.0.\n\nTo indicate that you agree to the terms of the DCO, you must “sign off” your contribution by adding a line with your name and e-mail address to every Git commit message:\n\n```\nSigned-off-by: <name> <email>\n\n```\n\nYou must use your real name (no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions are allowed.)\n\nYour signature certifies that you are either the author of the contribution or have the right to submit it under the open-source license used by Gauge and it's plugins.\n\nIf you set your `user.name` and `user.email` as part of your Git configuration, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit --signoff` or in short `git commit -s`.\n\n#### Adding signoff to earlier commits\n\nTo sign off your last commit from the command line, use:\n\n```\ngit commit --amend --signoff\n```\n\nThen force-push to update the branch on your fork with:\n\n```\ngit push --force-with-lease\n```\n\nGauge uses [GaugeBot](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-bot) to check for presence of the sign-off in every pull request, and this is a required check.\n\n### Developer documentation\n\nIf you are trying to write plugins for Gauge or trying to contribute to Gauge core, take a look at the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge/wiki/Gauge-Technical-Documentation).\n\n\n## Bump up gauge version\n\n* Update the value of `CurrentGaugeVersion` variable in `version/version.go` file.\n\nEx:\n```diff\n // CurrentGaugeVersion represents the current version of Gauge\n-var CurrentGaugeVersion = &Version{1, 5, 0}\n+var CurrentGaugeVersion = &Version{1, 5, 1}\n\n```\n"
