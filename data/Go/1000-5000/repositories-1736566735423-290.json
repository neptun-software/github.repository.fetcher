Install Docker\n\n    The easiest way to experiment with Contour is to build it in a container and run it locally in [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster.\n\n    On Mac, you can follow instructions to download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).\n\n    On Linux, you can follow one of the installation methods provided by [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).\n\n2. Install tools: `git`, `make`, `gcc` (used by `go test -race`), [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/), `kubectl`, `jq` and `yq`\n\n    On Mac, the easiest, and recommended way, to get `git` and `make` is to install Xcode command line tools. To install Xcode command line tools run:\n\n    ```bash\n    xcode-select --install\n    ```\n\n    For some of the other tools, the recommended way is to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install them. Once brew is installed you can run:\n\n    ```bash\n    brew install kind kubectl jq yq\n    ```\n\n    On Ubuntu Linux, some of the above tools can be downloaded via the package manager:\n\n    ```bash\n    apt-get install build-essential git jq\n    ```\n\n    Reference the documentation of the various tools for installation instructions for your platform:\n\n    * kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/\n    * kind: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installing-from-release-binaries\n    * yq: https://github.com/mikefarah/yq?tab=readme-ov-file#install\n\n3. Install Go\n\n    To debug locally and to run unit tests, you will need to install Go.\n    Contour generally uses the most recent minor [Go version][1].\n    Look in the `Makefile` (search for the `BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` variable) to find the specific version being used.\n\n    For installation instructions for Golang see: https://go.dev/doc/install\n\n    On Mac with homebrew, you can install Golang with:\n\n    ```bash\n    brew install go\n    ```\n\n4. (Optional for MacOS) [Docker Mac Net Connect](https://github.com/chipmk/docker-mac-net-connect) to connect directly to Docker-for-Mac containers via IP address.\n\n    See installation instructions [here](https://github.com/chipmk/docker-mac-net-connect?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)\n\n### Fetch the source\n\n1. [Fork][3] the projectcontour/contour repository.\n\n2. Create a local clone:\n\n    ```\n    git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/contour.git\n    ```\n    or\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/contour\n    ```\n\n### Running your first build\n\nTo build the Contour binary:\n\n```shell\ngo build ./cmd/contour\n```\n\n### Running unit tests\n\nTo run all of the unit tests:\n\n```shell\ngo test ./...\n```\n\nTo run the tests for a single package, change to the package directory and run:\n\n```shell\ngo test .\n```\n\n### Deploying to a local kind cluster\n\nThe simplest way to get up and running is to build Contour in a Docker container and to deploy it to a local Kind cluster.\nThese commands will launch a Kind cluster and deploy your build of Contour to it.\n\n```shell\nmake install-contour-working\n```\n\nor for Contour Gateway Provisioner:\n\n```shell\nmake install-provisioner-working\n```\n\nYou can access Contour in localhost ports 9080 and 9443.\n\nTo remove the Kind cluster and all resources, run:\n\n```shell\nmake cleanup-kind\n```\n\n#### MacOS\n\nBoth `install-contour-working` and `install-provisioner-working` configure [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) to setup a local LoadBalancer Service that can be accessed on the Docker network.\nOn Linux, you are able to directly reach IPs on the Docker network, but on MacOS the docker network is not directly accessible on the host.\n\nAs a workaround to this problem, [Docker Mac Net Connect](https://github.com/chipmk/docker-mac-net-connect) can be installed to setup a tunnel between your host and the Docker Desktop Linux VM (see [here](https://github.com/chipmk/docker-mac-net-connect?tab=readme-ov-file#how-does-it-work) for more info on how this works).\nTo setup follow the [readme installation instructions](https://github.com/chipmk/docker-mac-net-connect?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).\n\nOnce it is setup, you are able to create the kind cluster using the above instructions. If you have issues with connecting to the MetalLB IP try to restart the Docker Engine or make sure there is an HTTProxy deployed on your kind cluster so the Contour listener is created.\n\n### Pre-submit checks\n\nTo run all checks locally before submitting a pull request, run:\n\n```shell\nmake checkall\n```\n\nThis builds the binary, runs unit tests, runs the linters, and verifies that code generation (`make generate`) has been run and the results have been committed.\n\nSee `make help` for more information on other useful `make` targets.\n\n### Local Development/Testing\n\nAs an alternative to using `make install-contour-working` from above, you may prefer to be able to test out changes to Contour locally without building images and pushing into clusters.\n\nTo accomplish this, Envoy can be run inside a Kubernetes cluster, typically a `kind` cluster.\nThen Contour is run on your local machine and Envoy will be configured to look for Contour running on your machine vs running in the cluster.\n\n1. Create a kind cluster\n\n```shell\nkind create cluster --config=./examples/kind/kind-expose-port.yaml --name=contour\n```\n\n2. Deploy Contour & Deps to cluster:\n\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f examples/contour\n```\n\n_Note: The Contour Deployment/Service can be deleted if desired since it's not used._\n\n3. Find IP of local machine (e.g. `ifconfig` or similar depending on your environment)\n\n4. Edit Envoy Daemonset & change the xds-server value to your local IP address\n```shell\nkubectl edit ds envoy -n projectcontour\n```\n\nChange `initContainers:` to look like this updating the IP and removing the three envoy cert flags:\n```shell\n initContainers:\n  - args:\n    - bootstrap\n    - /config/envoy.json\n    - --xds-address=<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>\n    - --xds-port=8001\n    - --xds-resource-version=v3\n    - --resources-dir=/config/resources\n```\n\n5. Change your Contour code.\n\n6. Build & start Contour allowing Envoy to connect and get its configuration.\n```shell\nmake install && contour serve --kubeconfig=$HOME/.kube/config --xds-address=0.0.0.0 --insecure\n```\n\n8. Test using the local kind cluster by deploying resources into that cluster. Many of our examples use `local.projectcontour.io` which is configured to point to `127.0.0.1` which allows requests to route to the local kind cluster for easy testing.\n\n7. Make more changes and repeat step #6.\n\n## Contribution workflow\n\nThis section describes the process for contributing a bug fix or new feature.\nIt follows from the previous section, so if you haven't set up your Go workspace and built Contour from source, do that first.\n\n### Before you submit a pull request\n\nThis project operates according to the _talk, then code_ rule.\nIf you plan to submit a pull request for anything more than a typo or obvious bug fix, first you _should_ [raise an issue][6] to discuss your proposal, before submitting any code.\n\nDepending on the size of the feature you may be expected to first write a design proposal. Follow the [Proposal Process](https://github.com/projectcontour/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#proposal-process) documented in Contour's Governance.\n\n### Issue and PR Triage\n\n#### Project Board\n\nIn addition to maintaining the project repositories, project maintainers are responsible for maintaining the [project tracking board](https://github.com/orgs/projectcontour/projects/2).\nThis board is intended to organize work for the team as well as provide visibility into the status and priority of tracks of work, specific Issues, and PRs.\nThe board is used in conjunction with Issue and PR labels.\n\nPriority of cards on the board flows from left to right, with the *leftmost* column representing what is currently being worked on.\nWithin a column, priority flows from top to bottom, with the *topmost* cards having the highest priority.\n\nThe leftmost column should represent what is planned for the upcoming release.\nThe \"Investigating\" column contains longer term items that may need more information, feedback from Issue reporters, etc.\nFurther columns represent decreasing priority, with \"Prioritized Backlog\" containing cards that are coming soon, all the way to the \"Unprioritized\" column which contains items currently not yet sorted.\n\n**Notes for maintainers and contributors**\n- If you are looking for work to pick up:\n  - Look to the leftmost columns of the project board\n  - *New contributors* can use [this shortcut link](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) to find good beginner Contour issues to work on\n- When a new Issue or PR is added, add it to the project board and make a best judgement on relative priority so we have a starting place in triage\n- When moving items between columns, please add a comment to the Issue or PR detailing why so we have context in triage sessions\n\n#### Community Meeting Triage\n\nThe weekly Contour [community meeting](https://projectcontour.io/community/) provides some time for the maintainer team and community to collaborate on Issue and PR triage.\n\nCommunity members can add links to specific items they would like to discuss to the [meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/84Xbl4WBTpm7OBhaOAsSiw).\nThis time will be used for clarification, potential to bump priority in the queue of work items for the team, and the ability for contributors to provide more context to their contributions.\n\nIn addition, the meeting will be used to go over untriaged issues, longer-term items, and current progress on items in-flight as needed.\n\n**Procedural notes**\n- Once an issue has been discussed, remove and add the appropriate labels and pull the item into the correct column\n- After triage, Issues and PRs that are actively being worked on should be assigned to someone. This could be:\n  - the person working on the issue or PR or\n  - a maintainer who is shepherding a new contributor or large PR\n- Issues and PRs that are not being actively worked on should have comments updated with the current context, then be unassigned\n\n### Commit message and PR guidelines\n\n- Have a short subject on the first line and a body. The body can be empty.\n- Use the imperative mood (ie \"If applied, this commit will (subject)\" should make sense).\n- There must be a DCO line (\"Signed-off-by: David Cheney <cheneyd@vmware.com>\"), see [DCO Sign Off](#dco-sign-off) below.\n- Do not merge commits that don't relate to the affected issue (e.g. \"Updating from PR comments\", etc). Should\nthe need to cherrypick a commit or rollback arise, it should be clear what a specific commit's purpose is.\n- Put a summary of the main area affected by the commit at the start,\nwith a colon as delimiter. For example 'docs:', 'internal/(packagename):', 'design:' or something similar.\n- PRs *must* be labelled with a `release-note/category` label, where category is one of\n`major`, `minor`, `small`, `docs`, or `infra`, unless the change is really small, in which case\nit may have a `release-note/not-required` category. PRs may also include a `release-note/deprecation`\nlabel alone or in addition to the primary label.\n- PRs *must* include a file named `changelogs/unreleased/PR#-githubID-category.md`, which is a Markdown\nfile with a description of the change. Please see `changelogs/unreleased/<category>-sample.md` for\nsample changelogs.\n- If main has moved on, you'll need to rebase before we can merge,\nso merging upstream main or rebasing from upstream before opening your\nPR will probably save you some time.\n- Pull requests *must* include a `Fixes #NNNN` or `Updates #NNNN` comment.\nRemember that `Fixes` will close the associated issue, and `Updates` will link the PR to it.\n\n#### Commit message template\n\n```\n<packagename>: <imperative mood short description>\n\n<longer change description/justification>\n\nUpdates #NNNN\nFixes #MMMM\n\nSigned-off-by: Your Name <you@youremail.com>\n```\n\n#### Sample commit message\n\n```\ninternal/contour: Add quux functions\n\nTo implement the quux functions from #xxyyz, we need to\nflorble the greep dots, then ensure that the florble is\nwarbed.\n\nFixes #xxyyz\n\nSigned-off-by: Your Name <you@youremail.com>\n\n```\n\n### Merging commits\n\nMaintainers should prefer to merge pull requests with the [Squash and merge](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) option.\nThis option is preferred for a number of reasons.\nFirst, it causes GitHub to insert the pull request number in the commit subject which makes it easier to track which PR changes landed in.\nSecond, it gives maintainers an opportunity to edit the commit message to conform to Contour standards and general [good practice](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\nFinally, a one-to-one correspondence between pull requests and commits makes it easier to manage reverting changes and increases the reliability of bisecting the tree (since CI runs at a pull request granularity).\n\nAt a maintainer's discretion, pull requests with multiple commits can be merged with the [Create a merge commit](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges) option.\nMerging pull requests with multiple commits can make sense in cases where a change involves code generation or mechanical changes that can be cleanly separated from semantic changes.\nThe maintainer should review commit messages for each commit and make sure that each commit builds and passes tests.\n\n### Code formatting\n\nContour utilizes [`gofumpt`](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt) for strict Golang formatting of the contour codebase.\nThe `lint` CI job checks this to ensure all commits are formatted as expected.\n\nThe `make format` target can be used to run `gofumpt` locally before making a PR.\n\n### Import Aliases\n\nNaming is one of the most difficult things in software engineering.\nContour uses the following general pattern to name imports when referencing internal packages and packages from other projects.\n\n> thing_version: The name+package path of the thing and then the version separated by underscores\n\nExamples:\n\n```\ncontour_v1 \"github.com/projectcontour/contour/apis/projectcontour/v1\"\ncontour_v1alpha1 \"github.com/projectcontour/contour/apis/projectcontour/v1alpha1\"\nenvoy_v3 \"github.com/projectcontour/contour/internal/envoy/v3\"\nxdscache_v3 \"github.com/projectcontour/contour/internal/xdscache/v3\"\n```\n\nExact patterns for import paths can be found in the `importas` linter settings in `.golangci.yml`\n\n### Pre commit CI\n\nBefore a change is submitted it should pass all the pre commit CI jobs.\nIf there are unrelated test failures the change can be merged so long as a reference to an issue that tracks the test failures is provided.\n\nOnce a change lands in main it will be built and available at this tag, `ghcr.io/projectcontour/contour:main`.\nYou can read more about the available contour images in the [tagging][7] document.\n\n### Build an image\n\nTo build an image of your change using Contour's `Dockerfile`, run these commands (replacing the repository host and tag with your own):\n\n```\ndocker build -t ghcr.io/davecheney/contour:latest .\ndocker push ghcr.io/davecheney/contour:latest\n```\nor, you can use the make helper, like so:\n\n```\nREGISTRY=ghcr.io/davecheney VERSION=latest make push\n```\n\nThis will push to `:latest` in `ghcr.io/davecheney` obviously you'll also need to replace the repo host with your own here too. If you don't specify `VERSION`, `make push` will push to a git hash tag (the output of ` git rev-parse --short=8 --verify HEAD`).\n\n### Verify your change\n\nTo verify your change by deploying the image you built, take one of the [deployment manifests][7], edit it to point to your new image, and deploy to your Kubernetes cluster.\n\n## Contour testing\n\nThis section provides some useful information and guidelines for working with Contour's tests.\n\n### Glossary\n\n#### Config/Data Categories\n* **Kubernetes Config**: `HTTPProxy`, `Ingress` or [Gateway API][8] config that Contour watches and converts to Envoy config.\n* **DAG**: The internal Contour representation of L7 proxy concepts. Kubernetes config is first converted to DAG objects before being converted to Envoy config.\n* **Envoy Config**: Configuration that can be provided to Envoy via xDS. This is Contour's final output, generated directly from the DAG.\n\n#### Test Categories\n* **Unit Test**: A Go test for a particular function/package. In some cases, these test more than one package at a time.\n* **Feature Test**: A Go test in `internal/featuretests` that tests the translation of Kubernetes config to Envoy config, using a Contour event handler and xDS server.\n* **End-To-End (E2E) Test**: A Go test in `test/e2e` that performs a full end-to-end test of Contour running in a cluster. Typically verifies the behavior of HTTP requests given a Kubernetes `HTTPProxy`, `Ingress` or Gateway API config.\n\n### Summary of Major Test Suites\n\nThe following table describes the major test suites covering the core Contour processing pipeline (Kubernetes config -> DAG -> Envoy config).\nIn general, changes to the core processing pipeline should be accompanied by new/updated test cases in each of these test suites.\n\n| Test Suite | Description |\n| ---------- | ----------- |\n| `internal/dag/builder_test.go` (specifically `TestDAGInsert*` functions) | Tests conversion of Kubernetes config to DAG objects. |\n| `internal/dag/status_test.go` | Tests invalid Kubernetes (`HTTPProxy`) configs, verifying their status/conditions. |\n| `internal/envoy/v3/*_test.go` | Tests conversion of DAG objects to Envoy config. |\n| `internal/xdscache/v3/*_test.go` (specifically the `Test[Cluster\\|Listener\\|Route\\|Secret]Visit` functions) | Tests conversion of Kubernetes config to Envoy config. |\n| `internal/featuretests/v3/*_test.go` | Tests conversion of Kubernetes config to Envoy config, using a ~full Contour event handler and xDS server. |\n| `test/e2e/[httpproxy\\|gateway\\|ingress]` | E2E tests with Contour running in a cluster. Verifies behavior of HTTP requests for configured proxies. |\n\n> **Note:**\nTo compile code under folder `e2e` with VSCode, please add `\"go.buildTags\": \"e2e,conformance\"` to VSCode config file `settings.json`. Since tests under it have e2e and conformance build tags.\n\n\n## DCO Sign off\n\nAll authors to the project retain copyright to their work.

You can see the full report [here](Contour_Security_Audit_Dec2020.pdf).\n\n### Reporting security vulnerabilities\n\nIf you've found a security related issue, a vulnerability, or a potential vulnerability in Contour please let the [Contour Security Team](mailto:cncf-contour-maintainers@lists.cncf.io) know with the details of the vulnerability. We'll send a confirmation email to acknowledge your report, and we'll send an additional email when we've identified the issue positively or negatively.\n\nFor further details please see our [security policy](SECURITY.md).\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [the list of releases](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/releases) to find out about feature changes.\n"

          "content": "# Versioning and Release\nThis document describes the versioning and release process of Contour. This document is a living document, contents will be updated according to each release.\n\n## Releases\nContour releases will be versioned using dotted triples, similar to [Semantic Version](http://semver.org/). The project refers to the respective components of this triple as `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. The version number may have additional information, such as \"-rc1,-rc2,-rc3\" to mark release candidate builds for earlier access. Such releases will be considered as \"pre-releases\".\n\n### Major and Minor Releases\nMajor and minor releases of Contour will be branched from main when the release reaches to `RC (release candidate)` state. The release cadence is currently once a month, but is migrating to quarterly as of the October 2021 release (which will be Contour 1.20).\n\nIf for any reason this release cadence has to be adjusted (for example due to open source events), the project will communicate it clearly on Slack, Twitter, and distribution lists. There is no mandated timeline for major versions and there are currently no criteria for shipping a new major version (i.e. Contour 2.0.0). You can find additional resources on the [release process](https://projectcontour.io/resources/release-process/) portion of our website.\n\n### Patch releases\nPatch releases are based on the major/minor release branch. There is no specific release cadence for patch releases. However, the project will create patch releases to address critical community and security issues (for example to address high severity security issues in Contour or in Envoy).The project will issue patch releases for all supported versions of Contour.\n\n### Release Support Matrix\nPer the [Contour support policy](https://projectcontour.io/resources/support/), the project is in the process of transitioning to supporting three Contour releases. Please see the support policy page to see what versions are currently supported.\n\nAlso, please consult the [Contour Compatibility Matrix](https://projectcontour.io/resources/compatibility-matrix/) for details of what each version of Contour requires for each of its dependencies like Envoy, Kubernetes, and so on.\n\nBoth of these details are also available in a machine-consumable (YAML) format via [versions.yaml](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/blob/main/versions.yaml).\n\n\n### Upgrade path \nThe upgrade path for Contour, including upgrade instructions, is documented [here](https://projectcontour.io/resources/upgrading/). Each Contour version also requires a specific release of Envoy, documented in the upgrading portion of our website.\n\n### Next Release and Prioritized Backlog\nThe activity for the next release is tracked in the [up-to-date project board](https://github.com/orgs/projectcontour/projects/2). If your issue is not present the backlog, please reach out to the maintainers to add the issue to the project board.\n"
