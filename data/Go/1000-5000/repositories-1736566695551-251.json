If you haven't seen them already, the Kubernetes project has:\n\n- A [Contributor Guide][contrib-guide] - some [kubernetes/kubernetes]-specific content, but lots of info for the entire project\n- A [Contributor Cheat Sheet][contrib-cheatsheet] - lots of resources and handy links\n\n## Contact\n\nThis repo is owned by [SIG Testing][sig-testing], and the people most directly\ninvolved are listed in [/OWNERS]. We are most responsive on our slack channel\n\n- Community Site: [kubernetes/community/sig-testing][sig-testing]\n- Slack: [#sig-testing]\n- Mailing List: [kubernetes-sig-testing@]\n\nWe also have three other slack channels:\n\n- [#testing-ops]: for [prow.k8s.io] and other test-infra ops.\n- [#prow]: for discussions related to the use or development of [`prow`](/prow)\n- [#testgrid]: for discussions related to the use of development of [`testgrid`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/testgrid)\n\n## Workflow\n\nIn general we use the same pull request (PR) and review workflow used by the\nrest of the Kubernetes project. This means using:\n\n- [the CNCF CLA][cla]\n- [code review by reviewers and approvers listed in OWNERS files][owners]\n- tests that automatically exercise code or enforce conventions\n  - More recommendations on testing at [contributing-testing] and [testing.md]\n\nMany PRs will result in changes automatically being deployed.\n\nSome conventions that are specific to this repo:\n\n- For large code changes, please write a design doc or [KEP] and get signoff\n  from SIG Testing before trying to land code. If you're not sure what a KEP\n  should look like, [kuberenetes/enhancements/keps/sig-testing] has some\n  examples. If you're not sure what \"large\" means, [come ask us](#contact)\n- We find it polite to apply the `do-not-merge/hold` label via the `/hold`\n  command when in doubt about whether/when a PR should merge. If we don't\n  explain why we're adding a `/hold`, this is usually because the PR will\n  cause changes to be deployed on merge, and we want the person responsible\n  for deploying and monitoring the changes to decide when to `/hold cancel`.\n  In some cases this is the PR author, in other cases this may be whomever\n  is on-call for prow.k8.io.  If you are unsure which, please ask.\n- Use of the [`/cc @person`][command-cc] or [`/assign @person`][command-assign]\n  commands is the most effective way to put PRs on our radar. You can also\n  [contact us](#contact) on Slack.\n\n## Issue Triage\n\nIssues are ideally labeled with:\n\n- milestone: during which release cycle do we plan on working on this issue\n- `sig/foo`: which SIG owns this work\n- `area/foo`: which subproject or code is this issue related to\n- `kind/foo`: which kind of work is this issue describing\n- `priority/foo`: how important is this issue\n\nFor example, an issue related to cleaning up and consolidating (`kind/cleanup`)\nrelease-related (`sig/release`) jobs and dashboards (`area/config`) for the\nv1.16 cycle (`milestone: v1.16`) that may not get completed by the end of the\ncycle if more important or more urgent arises (`priority/important-longterm`).\n\nWe try to have a non-stale pool of issues that are available for new\ncontributors who want to help out but aren't sure what to work on or where to\nget started:\n\n- [`label:\"good first issue\"`][good-first-issue] - triaged per [Good First Issue docs][good-first-issue-docs]\n- [`label:\"help wanted\"`][help-wanted] - triaged per [Help Wanted docs][help-wanted-docs]\n\n## Guides\n\nIf you're not sure where to contribute or what any of these mean, please see\n[/README.md] for a brief description of the various codebases in this repo.\n\n### Build and Test\n\nWe use make rules to build, test and deploy code in this repo. In most\ncases you can get by just fine with:\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\n### Dependency Management\n\nPlease see [/docs/dep.md]\n\n### Prow Jobs\n\nThe majority of the Kubernetes project is tested via prowjobs that run on\n[prow.k8s.io]. See [/config/jobs/README.md] for more information.\n\n### TestGrid Config\n\nTest results generated by our prow jobs are available at [testgrid.k8s.io].\nTo learn more about how to configure which test results display where, see\n[/testgrid/README.md]\n\n### GitHub Labels\n\n[go.k8s.io/github-labels] describes GitHub labels that are synced across all\nKubernetes orgs and repos. To update these, please see [/label_sync/README.md]\n\n### External Test Results\n\nWe welcome contribution of e2e test results for [kubernetes/kubernetes]\ngenerated by other CI systems on other platforms to ensure that Kubernetes\nhas test coverage in a variety of environments. For more info please see\n[/docs/contributing-test-results.md]\n\n[contrib-guide]: https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/\n[contrib-cheatsheet]: https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/contributor-cheatsheet/\n[cla]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md\n[owners]: https://go.k8s.io/owners\n[KEP]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template\n[contributing-testing]: https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/contributing/#testing\n[testing.md]: contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md\n\n[sig-testing]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-testing\n[#sig-testing]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-testing\n[kubernetes-sig-testing@]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-testing\n\n[good-first-issue]: https://github.com/issues?q=repo%3Akubernetes%2Ftest-infra+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+\n[good-first-issue-docs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/help-wanted.md#good-first-issue\n[help-wanted]: https://github.com/issues?q=repo%3Akubernetes%2Ftest-infra+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A\"help+wanted\"\n[help-wanted-docs]: https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/help-wanted/\n\n[#prow]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/prow\n[#testgrid]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/testgrid\n[#testing-ops]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/testing-ops\n\n[/OWNERS]: /OWNERS\n[/README.md]: /README.md\n[/config/jobs/README.md]: /config/jobs/README.md\n[/docs/contributing-test-results.md]: /docs/contributing-test-results.md\n[/docs/dep.md]: /docs/dep.md\n[/label_sync/README.md]: /label_sync/README.md\n[/testgrid/README.md]: /testgrid/README.md\n\n[prow.k8s.io]: https://prow.k8s.io\n[testgrid.k8s.io]: https://testgrid.k8s.io\n[go.k8s.io/github-labels]: https://go.k8s.io/github-labels\n[go.k8s.io/oncall]: https://go.k8s.io/oncall\n[command-cc]: https://prow.k8s.io/command-help#cc\n[command-assign]: https://prow.k8s.io/command-help#assign\n\n[kubernetes/kubernetes]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\n[kuberenetes/enhancements/keps/sig-testing]: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-testing\n"

Everyone can participate in a \nself-service PR-based workflow, where changes are automatically deployed\nafter they have been reviewed. All job configs are located in [`config/jobs`]\n\n- [Add or update job configs](/config/jobs/README.md#adding-or-updating-jobs)\n- [Delete job configs](/config/jobs/README.md#deleting-jobs)\n- [Test job configs locally](/config/jobs/README.md#testing-jobs-locally)\n- [Trigger jobs on PRs using bot commands](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands)\n\n## Dashboards\n\n### Test Result Dashboards\n\n- [Testgrid](https://testgrid.k8s.io) shows historical test results over time ([`testgrid`])\n- [Triage](https://go.k8s.io/triage) shows clusters of similar test failures across all jobs ([`triage`](/triage))\n\n### Job and PR Dashboards\n\n- [Deck](https://prow.k8s.io) shows what jobs are running or have recently run in prow ([`prow/cmd/deck`])\n- [Gubernator's PR Dashboard](https://gubernator.k8s.io/pr) shows which PRs need your review ([`gubernator`])\n- [PR Status](https://prow.k8s.io/pr) shows what needs to be done to get PRs matching a GitHub Query to merge ([`prow/cmd/tide`])\n- [Tide History](https://prow.k8s.io/tide-history) shows what actions tide has taken over time to trigger tests and merge PRs ([`prow/cmd/tide`])\n- [Tide Status](https://prow.k8s.io/tide) shows what PRs are in tide pools to be tested and merged ([`prow/cmd/tide`])\n\n## Other Tools\n\n- [`boskos`](/boskos) manages pools of resources; our CI leases GCP projects from these pools\n- [`experiment`](/experiment) is a catchall directory for one-shot tools or scripts\n- [`gcsweb`](/gcsweb) is a UI we use to display test artifacts stored in public GCS buckets\n- [`ghproxy`](/ghproxy) is a GitHub-aware reverse proxy cache to help keep our GitHub API token usage within rate limits\n- [`gopherage`](/gopherage) is a tool for manipulating Go coverage files\n- [`greenhouse`](/greenhouse) is a shared bazel cache we use to ensure faster build and test presubmit jobs\n- [`label_sync`](/label_sync) creates, updates and migrates GitHub labels across orgs and repos based on `labels.yaml` file\n- [`kettle`](/kettle) extracts test results from GCS and puts them into bigquery\n- [`kubetest`](/kubetest) is how our CI creates and e2e tests kubernetes clusters\n- [`maintenance/migratestatus`](/maintenance/migratestatus) is used to migrate or retire GitHub status contexts on PRs across orgs and repos\n- [`metrics`](/metrics) runs queries against bigquery to generate metrics based on test results\n- [`robots/commenter`](/robots/commenter) is used by some of our jobs to comment on GitHub issues\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING.MD](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n[test-infra oncall]: https://go.k8s.io/oncall\n[@k8s-ci-robot]: (https://github.com/k8s-ci-robot)\n[#13063]: https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/13063\n[prow.k8s.io]: https://prow.k8s.io\n[kubernetes/kubernetes]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\n\n[bot commands]: https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands\n[`config/jobs`]: /config/jobs\n[`gubernator`]: /gubernator\n[`metrics`]: /metrics\n[`prow`]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow\n[`prow/cmd/tide`]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow/tree/main/cmd/tide\n[`prow/cmd/deck`]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow/tree/main/cmd/deck\n[`testgrid`]: /testgrid\n[testgrid.k8s.io]: https://testgrid.k8s.io\n[`triage`]: /triage\n"
