When using the `provided`, `provided.al2`, or `provided.al2023` runtime, the executable within the .zip file should be named `bootstrap`. Lambda's default architecture is `x86_64`, so when cross compiling from a non-x86 environment, the executable should be built with `GOARCH=amd64`. Likewise, if the Lambda function will be [configured to use ARM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-arch.html), the executable should built with `GOARCH=arm64`.\n\n``` shell\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bootstrap main.go\nzip lambda-handler.zip bootstrap\n```\n\n## For developers on Linux\n\nOn Linux, the Go compiler's default behavior is to link the output executable to the system libc for some standard library functionality (for example, DNS lookups). If the build environment is using a Linux distribution with a GNU libc version newer than the deployment environment, the application when deployed to Lambda may fail with an error like ``/lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_X.YZ' not found``. \n\nMost Go applications do not require linking to the system libc. This behavior can be disabled by using the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable.\n\n```\nCGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o bootstrap main.go\nzip lambda-handler.zip bootstrap\n```\n\nSee [Using CGO](#using-cgo)\n\n## For developers on Windows\n\nWindows developers may have trouble producing a zip file that marks the binary as executable on Linux. To create a .zip that will work on AWS Lambda, the `build-lambda-zip` tool may be helpful.\n\nGet the tool\n``` shell\ngo.exe install github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/cmd/build-lambda-zip@latest\n```\n\nUse the tool from your `GOPATH`. If you have a default installation of Go, the tool will be in `%USERPROFILE%\\Go\\bin`. \n\nin cmd.exe:\n``` bat\nset GOOS=linux\nset GOARCH=amd64\nset CGO_ENABLED=0\ngo build -o bootstrap main.go\n%USERPROFILE%\\Go\\bin\\build-lambda-zip.exe -o lambda-handler.zip bootstrap\n```\n\nin Powershell:\n``` posh\n$env:GOOS = \"linux\"\n$env:GOARCH = \"amd64\"\n$env:CGO_ENABLED = \"0\"\ngo build -o bootstrap main.go\n~\\Go\\Bin\\build-lambda-zip.exe -o lambda-handler.zip bootstrap\n```\n\n## Using CGO\n\nFor applications that require CGO, the build environment must be using a GNU libc version installed compatible with the target Lambda runtime. Otherwise, execution may fail with errors like ``/lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_X.YZ' not found``.\n\n| Lambda runtime  | GLIBC version\n| ----- | ---\n| `provided.al2023` | 2.34\n| `provided.al2` | 2.26\n| `provided` and `go1.x` | 2.17\n\n\nAlternatively, Lambda supports container images as a deployment package alternative to .zip files. For more information, refer to the official documentation for [working with with container images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html).\n\n# Deploying your functions\n\nTo deploy your function, refer to the official documentation for [deploying using the AWS CLI, AWS Cloudformation, and AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html).\n\n# Event Integrations\n\nThe [event models](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/tree/master/events) can be used to model AWS event sources. The official documentation has [detailed walkthroughs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/use-cases.html).\n\n"
