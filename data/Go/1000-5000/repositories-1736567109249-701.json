So far, it provides two tools:\n\n- `kwok` is the cornerstone of this project, responsible for simulating the lifecycle of fake nodes, pods, and other Kubernetes API resources.\n- `kwokctl` is a CLI tool designed to streamline the creation and management of clusters, with nodes simulated by `kwok`.\n\nPlease see [our website] for more in-depth information.\n\n<img width=\"700px\" src=\"./demo/manage-clusters.svg\">\n\n## Why KWOK?\n\n- Lightweight: You can [simulate thousands of nodes] on your laptop without significant consumption of CPU or memory resources.\nCurrently, KWOK can reliably maintain 1k nodes and 100k pods easily.\n- Fast: You can create and delete clusters and nodes almost instantly, without waiting for boot or provisioning.\nCurrently, KWOK can create 20 nodes or pods per second.\n- Compatibility: KWOK works with any tools or clients that are compliant with Kubernetes APIs, such as kubectl, helm, kui, etc.\n- Portability: KWOK has no specific hardware or software requirements. You can [run it using pre-built images], once Docker or Nerdctl is installed. Alternatively, binaries are also available for all platforms and can be easily installed.\n- Flexibility: You can configure different node types, labels, taints, capacities, conditions, etc., and you can configure different pod behaviors, status, etc. to test different scenarios and edge cases.\n\n## Community\n\nSee our own [contributor guide] and the Kubernetes [community page].\n\n### Getting Involved\n\nIf you're interested in participating in future discussions or development related to KWOK, there are several ways to get involved:\n\n- Slack: [#kwok] for general usage discussion, [#kwok-dev] for development discussion. (visit [slack.k8s.io] for a workspace invitation)\n- Open Issues/PRs/Discussions in [sigs.k8s.io/kwok]\n\n### Code of conduct\n\nParticipation in the Kubernetes community is governed by the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct][code of conduct].\n\n[KWOK]: https://sigs.k8s.io/kwok\n[our website]: https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io\n[community page]: https://kubernetes.io/community/\n[contributor guide]: https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/getting-started\n[code of conduct]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kwok/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md\n[sigs.k8s.io/kwok]: https://sigs.k8s.io/kwok/\n[#kwok]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/kwok/\n[#kwok-dev]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/kwok-dev/\n[slack.k8s.io]: https://slack.k8s.io/\n[simulate thousands of nodes]: https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/kwok-manage-nodes-and-pods/\n[run it using pre-built images]: https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/all-in-one-image/\n"
