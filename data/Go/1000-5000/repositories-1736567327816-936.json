          "content": "# Developing `kured`\n\nWe love contributions to `kured`, no matter if you are [helping out on\nSlack][slack], reporting or triaging [issues][issues] or contributing code\nto `kured`.\n\nIn any case, it will make sense to familiarise yourself with the main\n[documentation][documentation] to understand the different features and\noptions, which is helpful for testing. The \"building\" section in\nparticular makes sense if you are planning to contribute code.\n\n[slack]: https://github.com/kubereboot/kured/blob/main/README.md#getting-help\n[issues]: https://github.com/kubereboot/kured/issues\n[documentation]: https://kured.dev/docs\n\n## Certificate of Origin\n\nBy contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of\nOrigin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a\nsimple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the\ncontribution.\n\nWe require all commits to be signed. By signing off with your signature, you\ncertify that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to contribute the\nmaterial by the rules of the [DCO](DCO):\n\n`Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>`\n\nThe signature must contain your real name\n(sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions)\nIf your `user.name` and `user.email` are configured in your Git config,\nyou can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.\n\n## Kured Repositories\n\nAll Kured repositories are kept under <https://github.com/kubereboot>. To find the code and work on the individual pieces that make Kured, here is our overview:\n\n| Repositories                            | Contents                  |\n| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| <https://github.com/kubereboot/kured>   | Kured operator itself     |\n| <https://github.com/kubereboot/charts>  | Helm chart                |\n| <https://github.com/kubereboot/website> | website and documentation |\n\n### Kured code\n\n- Kured's main code can be found in the [`cmd`](cmd) and [`pkg`](pkg) directories\n- Its e2e tests are in the [`tests`](tests) directory\n- We use [GoReleaser to build](.goreleaser.yml).\n- Every PR and tagged release is tested by [Kind in GitHub workflows](.github/workflows).\n\nAs a project, we try to follow all the official and obvious standards.\n\n## Regular development activities\n\n### Prepare environment\n\nPlease run `make bootstrap-tools` once on a fresh repository clone to download several needed tools, e.g. GoReleaser.\n\n### Updating k8s support\n\nWhenever we want to update e.g. the `kubectl` or `client-go` dependencies,\nsome RBAC changes might be necessary too.\n\nThis is what it took to support Kubernetes 1.14:\n<https://github.com/kubereboot/kured/pull/75>\n\nThat the process can be more involved based on kubernetes changes.\nFor example, k8s 1.10 changes to apps triggered the following commits:\n\nb3f9ddf: Bump client-go for optimum k8s 1.10 compatibility\nbc3f28d: Move deployment manifest to apps/v1\n908998a: Update RBAC permissions for kubectl v1.10.3\nefbb0c3: Document version compatibility in release notes\n5731b98: Add warning to Dockerfile re: upgrading kubectl\n\nSearch the git log for inspiration for your cases.\n\nPlease update our `.github/workflows` with the new k8s images.\n\nFor that, run the following:\n\n`cp .github/kind-cluster-current.yaml .github/kind-cluster-previous.yaml`\n`cp .github/kind-cluster-next.yaml .github/kind-cluster-current.yaml`\n\nThen edit `.github/kind-cluster-next.yaml` to point to the new version.\n\nThis will make the full test matrix updated (the CI and the test code).\n\nOnce your code passes all tests, update the support matrix in\nthe [installation docs](https://kured.dev/docs/installation/).\n\n### Updating other dependencies\n\nDependabot proposes changes in our `go.mod`/`go.sum`.\nSome of those changes are covered by CI testing, some are not.\n\nPlease make sure to test those not covered by CI (mostly the integration\nwith other tools) manually before merging.\n\n### Review periodic jobs\n\nWe run periodic jobs (see also Automated testing section of this documentation).\nThose should be monitored for failures.\n\nIf a failure happen in periodics, something terribly wrong must have happened\n(or GitHub is failing at the creation of a kind cluster). Please monitor those\nfailures carefully.\n\n### Introducing new features\n\nWhen you introduce a new feature, the kured team expects you to have tested\nyour change thoroughly. If possible, include all the necessary testing in your change.\n\nIf your change involves a user facing change (change in flags of kured for example),\nplease include expose your new feature in our default manifest (`kured-ds.yaml`),\nas a comment.\n\nOur release manifests and helm charts are our stable interfaces.\nAny user facing changes will therefore have to wait for a release before being\nexposed to our users.\n\nThis also means that when you expose a new feature, you should create another PR\nfor your changes in <https://github.com/kubereboot/charts> to make your feature\navailable at the next kured version for helm users.\n\nIn the charts PR, you can directly bump the `appVersion` to the next minor version\n(you are introducing a new feature, which requires a bump of the minor number.\nFor example, if current `appVersion` is `1.6.x`, make sure you update your `appVersion`\nto `1.7.0`). It allows us to have an easy view of what we land each release.\n\nDo not hesitate to increase the test coverage for your feature, whether it's unit\ntesting to full functional testing (even using helm charts).\n\n### Increasing test coverage\n\nWe are welcoming any change to increase our test coverage.\nSee also our GitHub issues for the label\n[`testing`](https://github.com/kubereboot/kured/labels/testing).\n\n## Automated testing\n\nOur CI is covered by GitHub actions.\nYou can see their contents in `.github/workflows`.\n\nWe currently run:\n\n- go tests and lint\n- `shellcheck`\n- a check for dead links in our docs\n- a security check against our base image (alpine)\n- a deep functional test using our manifests on all supported k8s versions\n\nTo test your code manually, follow the section Manual testing.\n\n## Manual (release) testing\n\n### Quick Golang code testing\n\nPlease run `make test` to run only the basic tests. It gives a good\nidea of the code behaviour.\n\n### Manual functional testing\n\nBefore `kured` is released, we want to make sure it still works fine on the\nprevious, current and next minor version of Kubernetes (with respect to the\n`client-go` & `kubectl` dependencies in use). For local testing e.g.\n`minikube` or `kind` can be sufficient. This will allow you to catch issues\nthat might not have been tested in our CI, like integration with other tools,\nor your specific use case.\n\nDeploy kured in your test scenario, make sure you pass the right `image`,\nupdate the e.g. `period` and `reboot-days` options, so you get immediate\nresults, if you login to a node and run:\n\n```console\nsudo touch /var/run/reboot-required\n```\n\n### Example of functional testing with `minikube`\n\nA test-run with `minikube` could look like this:\n\n```cli\n# start minikube\nminikube start --driver=kvm2 --kubernetes-version <k8s-release>\n\n# build kured image and publish to registry accessible by minikube\nmake image minikube-publish\n\n# edit kured-ds.yaml to\n#   - point to new image\n#   - change e.g. period and reboot-days option for immediate results\n\nminikube kubectl -- apply -f kured-rbac.yaml\nminikube kubectl -- apply -f kured-ds.yaml\nminikube kubectl -- logs daemonset.apps/kured -n kube-system -f\n\n# In separate terminal\nminikube ssh\n sudo touch /var/run/reboot-required\nminikube logs -f\n```\n\nNow check for the 'Commanding reboot' message and minikube going down.\n\nUnfortunately as of today, you are going to run into\n<https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/2874>. This means that\nminikube won't come back easily. You will need to start minikube again.\nThen you can check for the lock release.\n\n### Example of testing with `kind`\n\nA test-run with `kind` could look like this:\n\n```cli\n# create kind cluster\nkind create cluster --config .github/kind-cluster-<k8s-version>.yaml\n\n# create reboot required files on pre-defined kind nodes\n./tests/kind/create-reboot-sentinels.sh\n\n# check if reboot is working fine\n./tests/kind/follow-coordinated-reboot.sh\n\n```\n\n### Example of testing with `kind` and `make`\n\nA test-run with `kind` and `make` can be done with the following command:\n\n```cli\n# Build kured:dev image, build manifests, and run the \"long\" go tests\nmake e2e-test\n```\n\nYou can alter test behaviour by passing arguments to this command.\nA few examples below:\n\n```shell\n# Run only TestE2EWithSignal test for the kubernetes version named \"current\" (see kind file)\nmake e2e-test ARGS=\"-run ^TestE2EWithSignal/current\"\n# Run all tests but make sure to extend the timeout, for slower machines.\nmake e2e-test ARGS=\"-timeout 1200s'\n```\n\n## Publishing a new kured release\n\n### Prepare Documentation\n\nEnsure the [compatibility matrix](https://kured.dev/docs/installation/) is\nupdated to the new version you want to release.\n\n### Update the manifests with the new version\n\nCreate a commit updating the manifest with future image [like this one](https://github.com/kubereboot/kured/commit/58091f6145771f426b4b9e012a43a9c847af2560).\n\n### Create the new version tag on the repo\n\nTag the previously created commit with the future release version.\nThe Github Actions workflow will push the new image to the registry.\n\n### Create the combined manifest for the new version\n\nNow create the `kured-<new version>-dockerhub.yaml` for e.g. `1.3.0`:\n\n```sh\nVERSION=1.3.0\nMANIFEST=\"kured-$VERSION-dockerhub.yaml\"\nmake DH_ORG=\"kubereboot\" VERSION=\"${VERSION}\" manifest\ncat kured-rbac.yaml > \"$MANIFEST\"\ncat kured-ds.yaml >> \"$MANIFEST\"\n```\n\n### Publish new version release artifacts\n\nNow you can head to the GitHub UI for releases, drafting a new\nrelease. Chose, as tag, the new version number.\n\nClick to generate the release notes.\n\nFill, as name, \"Kured <new version>\".\n\nEdit the generated text.\n\nPlease describe what's new and noteworthy in the release notes, list the PRs\nthat landed and give a shout-out to everyone who contributed.\nPlease also note down on which releases the upcoming `kured` release was\ntested on or what it supports. (Check old release notes if you're unsure.)\n\nBefore clicking on publishing release, upload the yaml manifest\n(`kured-<new version>-dockerhub.yaml`) file.\n\nClick on publish the release and set as the latest release.\n"

As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public\n  forums and open repositories.\n\n- Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit\n  contributions, which will be considered on their merits.\n\n- Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes\n  priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals.  Each\n  contributor participates in the project as an individual.\n\n- Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which\n  can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.\n\n- Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through\n  participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership\n  positions.\n\n- Consensus: Whether or not wider input is required, the Kured community believes that\n  the best decisions are reached through Consensus\n  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making>.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nKured Maintainers have write access to the [project GitHub\norganisation](https://github.com/kubereboot). They can merge their own patches or patches\nfrom others. The current maintainers can be found in [MAINTAINERS][maintainers-file].\nMaintainers collectively manage the project's resources and contributors.\n\nThis privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers\nare people who care about the Kured project and want to help it grow and\nimprove. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who\nhas demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most\nknowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and\nfollow through to fix issues (in code or tests).\n\nA maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping\nthe project succeed.\n\n## Becoming a Maintainer\n\nTo become a Maintainer you need to demonstrate the following:\n\n- commitment to the project:\n  - participate in discussions, contributions, code and documentation reviews\n      for 3 months or more and participate in Slack discussions and meetings\n      if possible,\n  - perform reviews for 5 non-trivial pull requests,\n  - contribute 5 non-trivial pull requests and have them merged,\n- ability to write quality code and/or documentation,\n- ability to collaborate with the team,\n- understanding of how the team works (policies, processes for testing and code review, etc),\n- understanding of the project's code base and coding and documentation style.\n\nWe realise that everybody brings different abilities and qualities to the team, that's\nwhy we are willing to change the rules somewhat depending on the circumstances.\n\nA new Maintainer can apply by proposing a PR to the [MAINTAINERS\nfile][maintainers-file]. A simple majority vote of existing Maintainers\napproves the application.\n\nMaintainers who are selected will be granted the necessary GitHub rights,\nand invited to the [private maintainer mailing list][private-list].\n\n## Meetings\n\nTime zones permitting, Maintainers are expected to participate in the public\ndeveloper meeting, details can be found [here][meeting-agenda].\n\nMaintainers will also have closed meetings in order to discuss security reports\nor Code of Conduct violations.  Such meetings should be scheduled by any\nMaintainer on receipt of a security issue or CoC report.  All current Maintainers\nmust be invited to such closed meetings, except for any Maintainer who is\naccused of a CoC violation.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) violations by community members will\nbe discussed and resolved on the [private Maintainer mailing list][private-list].\nIf the reported CoC violator is a Maintainer, the Maintainers will instead\ndesignate two Maintainers to work with CNCF staff in resolving the report.\n\n## Voting\n\nWhile most business in Kured is conducted by \"lazy consensus\", periodically\nthe Maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes.\nA vote can be taken in [kured issues labeled 'decision'][decision-issues] or\n[the private Maintainer mailing list][private-list] for security or conduct\nmatters. Votes may also be taken at [the developer meeting][meeting-agenda].\nAny Maintainer may demand a vote be taken.\n\nMost votes require a simple majority of all Maintainers to succeed. Maintainers\ncan be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of all Maintainers, and changes to this\nGovernance require a 2/3 vote of all Maintainers.\n\n[maintainers-file]: ./MAINTAINERS\n[private-list]: cncf-kured-maintainers@lists.cncf.io\n[meeting-agenda]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AWT8YDdqZY-Se6Y1oAlwtujWLVpNVK2M_F_Vfqw06aI/edit\n[decision-issues]: https://github.com/kubereboot/kured/labels/decision\n"
