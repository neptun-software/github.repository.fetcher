This document is a guideline about how to contribute to Sentinel Golang.\nIf you find something incorrect or missing, please leave comments / suggestions.\n\n## Before you get started\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### Setting up your development environment\n\nYou should have Go 1.12+ installed in your operating system.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe are always very happy to have contributions, whether for typo fix, bug fix or big new features.\nPlease do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.\n\nWe strongly value documentation and integration with other projects.\nWe are very glad to accept improvements for these aspects.\n\n### GitHub workflow\n\nWe use the `master` branch as the development branch, which indicates that this is a unstable branch.\n\nHere are the workflow for contributors:\n\n1. Fork to your own\n2. Clone fork to local repository\n3. Create a new branch and work on it\n4. Keep your branch in sync\n5. Commit your changes (make sure your commit message concise)\n6. Push your commits to your forked repository\n7. Create a pull request\n\nPlease follow [the pull request template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).\nPlease make sure the PR has a corresponding issue.\n\nAfter creating a PR, one or more reviewers will be assigned to the pull request.\nThe reviewers will review the code.\n\nBefore merging a PR, squash any fix review feedback, typo, merged, and rebased sorts of commits.\nThe final commit message should be clear and concise.\n\n### Open an issue / PR\n\nWe use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang/pulls) for trackers.\n\nIf you find a typo in document, find a bug in code, or want new features, or want to give suggestions,\nyou can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang/issues/new) to report it.\nPlease follow the guideline message in the issue template.\n\nIf you want to contribute, please follow the [contribution workflow](#github-workflow) and create a new pull request.\nIf your PR contains large changes, e.g. component refactor or new components, please write detailed documents\nabout its design and usage.\n\nNote that a single pull request should not be too large. If heavy changes are required, it's better to separate the changes\nto a few individual PRs.\n\n### Code review\n\nAll code should be well reviewed by one or more committers. Some principles:\n\n- Readability: Important code should be well-documented. Comply with our code style.\n- Elegance: New functions, classes or components should be well designed.\n- Testability: Important code should be well-tested (high unit test coverage).\n\n## Community\n\n### Contact us\n\n#### Gitter\n\nOur Gitter room: [https://gitter.im/alibaba/Sentinel](https://gitter.im/alibaba/Sentinel)."

You can see the runtime information of a single machine in real-time, and pump the metrics to outside metric components like Prometheus.\n- **Cloud-native ecosystem**: Sentinel Go provides [out-of-box integrations with cloud-native components](https://sentinelguard.io/en-us/docs/golang/open-source-framework-integrations.html).\n\n## Documentation\n\n[![GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang)\n\nSee the [中文文档](https://sentinelguard.io/zh-cn/docs/golang/basic-api-usage.html) for the document in Chinese.\n\nSee the [Wiki](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang/wiki) for full documentation, examples, blog posts, and other information.\n\nIf you are using Sentinel, please [**leave a comment here**](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/issues/18) to tell us your scenario to make Sentinel better.\nIt's also encouraged to add the link of your blog post, tutorial, demo or customized components to [**Awesome Sentinel**](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-awesome).\n\n## Sub-projects\n\n- [Sentinel Go adapters for frameworks](https://sentinelguard.io/en-us/docs/golang/open-source-framework-integrations.html)\n- [Sentinel Go dynamic data-source modules](https://sentinelguard.io/en-us/docs/golang/dynamic-data-source-usage.html)\n\n## Bugs and Feedback\n\nFor bug report, questions and discussions please submit [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang/issues).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are always welcomed!
