For major changes, please\nopen an issue first to discuss the changes.\n\n## Writing Commit Messages\n\nWe use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (also known as semantic commits) to ensure consistent\nand descriptive commit messages.\n\n## Tests\n\n### Running tests\n\n```shell\n# setup deps & generate code â€“ requires docker to be installed\n# this starts a docker compose stack with all required databases\ngo generate -tags setup ./...\n# if you already ran setup, just run the following\ngo generate ./...\ngo test ./... -v\n\n# to teardown docker containers:\ngo generate -tags teardown ./...\n```\n\n### How integration tests work\n\nMost test live in the `test/` directory and are integration tests of the generated client. That means there's a Prisma\nschema and before running the test, the client needs to be generated first. There may be table-driven tests which, on\neach individual test run, creates a new isolated database, runs migrations, then run the tests, and finally cleans up\nthe database afterwards.\n\nYou can also run individual code generation tests via your editor, however keep in mind you need to run\n`go generate ./...` before in the directory of the tests you want to run.\n\n### E2E tests\n\nEnd-to-end tests require third party credentials and may also be flaky from time to time. This is why they are not run\nlocally by default and optional in CI.\n\nTo run them locally, you need to set up all required credentials (check\nthe [env vars used for CI](https://github.com/steebchen/prisma-client-go/blob/a8a05c34aadd035303ea4651fcf6187cc4d039a0/.github/workflows/e2e-test.yml#L43),\nand then run:\n\n```sh\ncd test/e2e/\ngo generate -tags e2e ./...\ngo test ./... -run '^TestE2E.*$' -tags e2e -v\n```\n"

You can use it as an alternative to traditional ORMs such as gorm, xorm, sqlboiler and most\ndatabase-specific tools.\n\nIt is part of the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ecosystem. Prisma provides database tools for data access,\ndeclarative data modeling, schema migrations and visual data management.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started, [**read the quickstart tutorial**](https://goprisma.org/docs/getting-started/quickstart) to add Prisma\nto your project in just a few minutes.\n\nYou also might want to read [deployment tips](https://goprisma.org/docs/reference/deploy) and\nthe [full API reference](https://goprisma.org/docs/reference).\n\n## Status\n\nThe Go client is currently maintained by @steebchen and considered to be in alpha. I am actively looking\nfor [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/steebchen) who can support the continuous maintenance and development of new\nfeatures to finally make working with databases in Go fun. If you [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/steebchen) me, I\nwill prioritize your issues and feature requests and will help you set up and answer any questions you have.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck out the [advanced contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Security\n\nIf you have a security issue to report, please contact us\nat [security@prisma.io](mailto:security@prisma.io?subject=[GitHub]%20Prisma%20Security%20Report%20Go&cc=contact@luca-steeb.com)\n"
