          "content": "# Komiser Contributing Guide\n\n## Welcome\n\n🎉 **Want to contribute to Komiser, but not sure where to start?** We've got you covered!\n\n**Welcome to the Komiser Contributing Guide** where you'll find everything you need to get started with contributing to Komiser.\n\nWe are thrilled to have you as part of our community and looking forward to your valuable contributions! 🌟\n\n## Before You Get Started!\n\nBefore getting started with your first contribution, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n### For Major Feature Enhancements\n\n🚀 **Planning to work on adding a major feature enhancement?** That's amazing we always encourage ambitious contributions. **Keep in mind though that we always recommend discussing your plans with the team first.**\n\nThis provides an opportunity for fellow contributors to - **guide you in the right direction**, **offer feedback on your design**, and **potentially identify if another contributor is already working on a similar task**.\n\nHere's how to reach out:\n\n- Join the **#contributors** channel on our [Discord Server](https://discord.tailwarden.com) to start the discussion.\n- Share your idea(s) in the **#feature-request** channel and get feedback from the community.\n\n### For Bug Reports and Minor Fixes\n\n🐞 **Found a bug and wish to fix it?** Each and every contribution matters regardless of its size!\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind in this case:\n\n- Before creating a new issue, please make sure to check for an already [existing issue](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/issues) for that bug.\n- If an issue doesn't exist, [create a new issue](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/issues/new/choose) of **\\`type: Bug Report\\`** and make sure to provide as much detail as possible.\n- Feel free to reach out to us on **#contributors** or **#feedback** channel on our Discord Server, if you need any assistance or have questions.\n\n## General Contribution Flow\n\nThis section covers the **general contribution flow** when contributing to any area of **Komiser (Engine or the UI)** and some best practices to follow along the way.\n\nFollowing these steps will ensure that your contributions are well-received, reviewed, and integrated effectively into Komiser's codebase.\n\n### Fork and Pull Request Flow\n\n1️⃣ Head over to the [Komiser GitHub repo](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser) and \"fork it\" into your own GitHub account.\n\n2️⃣ Clone your fork to your local machine, using the following command:\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:USERNAME/FORKED-PROJECT.git\n```\n\n3️⃣ Create a new branch based-off **\\`develop\\`** branch:\n```bash\ngit checkout develop\ngit checkout -b fix/XXX-something develop\n```\nMake sure to follow the following branch naming conventions:\n- For feature/enchancements, use: **\\`feature/xxxx-name_of_feature\\`**\n- For bug fixes, use: **\\`fix/xxxx-name_of_bug\\`**\n> Here, **\\`xxxx\\`** is the issue number associated with the bug/feature!\n> For example:\n> ```bash\n> git checkout -b feature/1022-kubecost-integration develop\n> ```\n\n4️⃣ Implement the changes or additions you intend to contribute. Whether it's **bug fixes**, **new features**, or **enhancements**, this is where you put your coding skills to use.\n\n5️⃣ Once your changes are ready, you may then commit and push the changes from your working branch:\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"fix(xxxx-name_of_bug): nice commit description\"\ngit push origin feature/1022-kubecost-integration\n```\n\n6️⃣ While submitting Pull Request, **make sure to change the base branch from**: [master](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/tree/master) to [develop](v). Making sure to avoid any possible merge conflicts\n\n### Keeping your Fork Up-to-Date\n\nIf you plan on doing anything more than just a tiny quick fix, you’ll want to **make sure you keep your fork up to date** by tracking the original [“upstream” repo](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser) that you forked.\n\nFollow the steps given below to do so:\n\n1️⃣ Add the 'upstream' repo to list of remotes:\n```bash\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser.git\n```\n\n2️⃣ Fetch upstream repo’s branches and latest commits:\n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\n```\n\n3️⃣ Checkout to the **\\`develop\\`** branch and merge the upstream:\n```bash\ngit checkout develop\ngit merge upstream/develop\n```\n\n**Now, your local 'develop' branch is up-to-date with everything modified upstream!**\n\n\n# 🚀 Contributing to Komiser Engine\n\nThe core Komiser Engine is written in Go (Golang) and leverages Go Modules. Here are the prerequisites to run Komiser on your local machine:\n\n1. 🌐 **Go Version**:\n   - Latest Go version (currently its **`1.19`**) must be installed if you want to build and/or make changes to the existing code. The binary **`go1.19`** should be available in your path.\n     > 💡 If you wish to keep multiple versions of Go in your system and don't want to disturb the existing ones, refer [the guide](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install).\n\n2. 🔧 **GOPATH**:\n   - Ensure that the **`GOPATH`** environment variable is configured appropriately.\n\n\n## 🌟 Ways to Contribute to Komiser Engine\n\nKomiser is an open-source cloud-agnostic resource manager. It helps you break down cloud resource costs at the resource level. As a cloud-agnostic cloud management tool, we always have more providers and cloud services to add, update, and cost-calculate.\n\n\n### ☁️ Adding a new Cloud Provider\n\n#### 1️⃣ Create provider.\nCreate `provider_name.go` in `providers/provider_name` directory.\n\n#### 2️⃣  Add the following boilerplate:\n```go\npackage PROVIDER_NAME\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"log\"\n\n\t. \"github.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers\"\n\t\"github.com/uptrace/bun\"\n)\n\nfunc listOfSupportedServices() []FetchDataFunction {\n\treturn []FetchDataFunction{}\n}\n\nfunc FetchProviderData(ctx context.Context, client ProviderClient, db *bun.DB) {\n\tfor _, function := range listOfSupportedServices() {\n\t\tresources, err := function(ctx, client)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"[%s][PROVIDER] %s\", client.Name, err)\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tfor _, resource := range resources {\n\t\t\t\tdb.NewInsert().Model(&resource).Exec(context.Background())\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n#### 3️⃣ Add SDK client details:\nAdd your client details to [**`providers/provider.go`**](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/blob/develop/providers/providers.go)\n\n```go\ntype ProviderClient struct {\n\tAWSClient          *aws.Config\n\tDigitalOceanClient *godo.Client\n\tOciClient          common.ConfigurationProvider\n\tCivoClient         *civogo.Client\n\tK8sClient          *K8sClient\n\tLinodeClient       *linodego.Client\n\tTencentClient      *tccvm.Client\n\tAzureClient        *AzureClient\n\tScalewayClient     *scw.Client\n\tMongoDBAtlasClient *mongodbatlas.Client\n\tGCPClient          *GCPClient\n\tName               string\n}\n\ntype AzureClient struct {\n\tCredentials    *azidentity.ClientSecretCredential\n\tSubscriptionId string\n}\n```\n\n#### 4️⃣ Add provider configuration:\nAdd provider configuration in TOML format in **`config.toml`**\n\n```toml\n[[gcp]]\nname=\"production\"\nsource=\"ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES\"\n# path=\"./path/to/credentials/file\" specify if 'CREDENTIALS_FILE' is used as source\nprofile=\"production\"\n```\n\n#### 5️⃣ Update Dashboard Utils\nNavigate to the `dashboard/utils` folder in your project and locate the file named `servicehelper.ts`. Open the file and follow these steps:\n\n##### a. Add Provider to Union Type\nLocate the `Providers` union type at the top of the file. Add the new cloud provider in lowercase to the union.\n\n```typescript\n// dashboard/utils/servicehelper.ts\n\nexport type Providers =\n  | 'aws'\n  | 'gcp'\n  | 'digitalocean'\n  | 'azure'\n  | 'civo'\n  | 'kubernetes'\n  | 'linode'\n  | 'tencent'\n  | 'oci'\n  | 'scaleway'\n  | 'mongodbatlas'\n  | 'ovh'\n  | 'scaleway'\n  | 'tencent'\n  | 'provider_name'; // Add the new provider here\n\n```\n##### b. Add Provider and Service to `allProvidersServices`\n\nFind the `allProvidersServices` object in the `servicehelper.ts` file and add the new provider along with the service in lowercase.\n\n```typescript\n// dashboard/utils/servicehelper.ts\n\nexport const allProvidersServices: { [key in Providers | string]: string[] } = {\n  // ... other services\n  new_provider: ['new_service_name'],\n};\n```\n\n#### 6️⃣ Compile a new Komiser binary:\n```bash\ngo build\n```\n\n#### 7️⃣ Start a new Komiser development server:\n\n```bash\n./komiser start\n```\n\n### 🔋 Adding a new Cloud Service/Resource\n\nHere are the general steps to add a new service/resource for a cloud provider in Komiser:\n\n#### 1️⃣ Create Service\nCreate a new file `servicename.go` under the path `providers/provider_name/servicename`\n\n#### 2️⃣ Add boilerplate\nAdd the following boilerplate code, which defines the structure of any new service/resource to be added for a cloud provider:\n\n```go\npackage service\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"log\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t. \"github.com/tailwarden/komiser/models\"\n\t. \"github.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers\"\n)\n\nfunc MyServiceResources(ctx context.Context, client ProviderClient) ([]Resource, error) {\n\tresources := make([]Resource, 0)\n\t\n    // Logic goes here\n\n\tlog.Printf(\"[%s] Fetched %d CLOUD PROVIDER NAME resources\\n\", client.Name, len(resources))\n\treturn resources, nil\n}\n```\n\nTo understand how to write the required logic, you may refer any [existing examples](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/tree/develop/providers/aws) for inspiration!\n\n#### 3️⃣ Edit Provider\nCall the `MyServiceResources()` function from the above file, by adding it to `providers/providername/provider.go` file's `listOfSupportedServices()` function.\n\n```go\nfunc listOfSupportedServices() []providers.FetchDataFunction {\n\treturn []providers.FetchDataFunction{\n\t\tec2.Instances,\n\t\tec2.ElasticIps,\n\t\tlambda.Functions,\n\t\tec2.Acls,\n\t\tec2.Subnets,\n\t\tec2.SecurityGroups,\n\t\tec2.AutoScalingGroups,\n\t\tec2.InternetGateways,\n\t\tiam.Roles,\n\t\tiam.InstanceProfiles,\n\t\tiam.OIDCProviders,\n\t\tiam.SamlProviders,\n\t\tiam.Groups,\n.\n.\n.\n```\n\n#### 4️⃣ Update Dashboard Utils\nNavigate to the `dashboard/utils` folder in your project and locate the file named `servicehelper.ts`. Open the file and find the `allProvidersServices` object. Add the new service name in lowercase under the respective provider, adhering to the existing structure.\n\nHere's an example of how to add the new service:\n\n```typescript\n// dashboard/utils/servicehelper.ts\n\nexport const allProvidersServices: { [key in Providers | string]: string[] } = {\n  // ... other services\n  your_provider_name: [\n    'existing_service_1',\n    'existing_service_2',\n    // ... other existing services\n    'new_service_name', // Add the new service here\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n#### 5️⃣\nDo above mentioned steps [4](#4️⃣-add-provider-configuration), [5](#5️⃣-compile-a-new-komiser-binary) and [6](#6️⃣-start-a-new-komiser-development-server). You'll see a new resource/service added to Komiser, in the dashboard!\n\nAdditionally, [here](https://youtu.be/Vn5uc2elcVg?feature=shared) is a video tutorial of the entire process for your reference.\n\n> 💡 Tip: you can also start the server via `go run *.go start --config ./config.toml` if you do want to skip the compile step!\n\n### 3️⃣ Enhance existing Cloud service/resource\n\n**So, you wish to improve the code quality of an existing cloud service/resource?** Feel free to discuss your ideas with us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.tailwarden.com) and [open a new issue](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/issues).\n\n## 🧪 Testing Your Changes\n\nWe leverage the [testing](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) package for tests. Test names follow the `TestXxx(*testing.T)` format where Xxx does not start with a lowercase letter. The function name serves to identify the test routine.\nFor creating a new test you create a `[name]_test.go` next to the file you'd like to test and replace `[name]` with your filename of the implementation. Look at any of the `*_test.go` files for an example or read the [official docs](https://pkg.go.dev/testing).\nYou then can run it with `go test /path/to/your/folder/where/the/test/is`. You can run all of our engine tests with `make tests`. You should see something similar to this:\n\n```logtalk\ngo test ./... | grep -v /dashboard/\n...\nok  \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/internal\t(cached) [no tests to run]\n?   \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/ecr\t[no test files]\n?   \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/ecs\t[no test files]\n?   \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/efs\t[no test files]\n?   \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/eks\t[no test files]\n?   \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/elasticache\t[no test files]\n?   \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/elb\t[no test files]\n?   \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/iam\t[no test files]\nok  \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/ec2\t(cached)\n?   \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/kms\t[no test files]\n?   \tgithub.com/tailwarden/komiser/providers/aws/lambda\t[no test file\n...\n```\n\n# 🚀 Contributing to Komiser Dashboard UI\n\nKomiser Dashboard utilizes a modern tech stack. Here's a brief about it:\n\n- **Framework**: [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/)\n- **Language**: [**Typescript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n- **CSS**: [**Tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- **Component Library**: [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/why-storybook)\n- **Testing**:\n  - [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/)\n  - [**React Testing Library**](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)\n\n## 🧩 Prerequisites\n\n1. While working on Komiser UI, you'd typically need the Komiser Server as well. Follow the instructions in the [**Komiser Installation**](#komiser-installation) section above.\n2. Ensure you're using the **latest versions** of the tech stack mentioned above.\n\n## 🛠 Setup a Local Development Server\n\nLet's get your hands dirty by setting up the Komiser dashboard:\n\n### 1️⃣ Grab the Go Dependencies\n```bash\ngo mod download\n```\n\n### 2️⃣ Configure `config.toml`\n\nIf it doesn't exist, create `config.toml` in the root and use this template:\n\n```toml\n[[aws]]\n\tname=\"sandbox\"\n\tsource=\"CREDENTIALS_FILE\"\n\tpath=\"./path/to/credentials/file\"\n\tprofile=\"default\"\n\n[[aws]]\n\tname=\"staging\"\n\tsource=\"CREDENTIALS_FILE\"\n\tpath=\"./path/to/credentials/file\"\n\tprofile=\"staging-account\"\n\n[[gcp]]\n\tname=\"production\"\n\tsource=\"ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES\"\n\t# path=\"./path/to/credentials/file\" specify if CREDENTIALS_FILE is used\n\tprofile=\"production\"\n\n[sqlite]\n  file=\"komiser.db\"\n```\n\n> 📘 Dive deeper in our [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.komiser.io/getting-started/quickstart) for more configurations like connecting to PostgreSQL.\n\nNow, craft your credentials. Check out the guides [here](https://docs.komiser.io/getting-started/quickstart#self-hosted) to tailor the config for your needs.\n\n### 3️⃣ Boot Up the Komiser Backend\n```bash\ngo run *.go start --config ./config.toml\n```\n\n> 🖥️ This fires up the dashboard at [`http://localhost:3002/`](http://localhost:3002). However, it mirrors the **`master`** branch. Let's make it reflect your development branch!\n\n### 4️⃣ Navigate to the Dashboard Directory\n```bash\ncd dashboard\n```\n\n### 5️⃣ Set up Environment Variables\nCreate or update the **`.env`** file:\n```\nNEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n### 6️⃣ Spin up the Dev Server\nInstall dependencies and fire up the dev server:\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n> 🟢 NodeJS: Ensure you're on the `18.x.x` LTS release.\n\nOnce done, open up [**`http://localhost:3002/`**](http://localhost:3002)\n\n![Komiser Dashboard](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryvOPmFla.png)\n\n📺 For a more detailed walkthrough, check the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/uwxj11-eRt8?feature=shared).\n\n## 🎨 Understanding the UI Components\n\nKomiser's UI elegance is sculpted using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Dive deep into the [components section](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/tree/develop/dashboard#components) to grasp our conventions.\n\n## 🧪 Testing Your Changes\n\nWe leverage **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit tests. Navigate to the [testing section](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/tree/develop/dashboard#testing) for insights on writing tests.\n\n## 📦 Building a Go Artifact\n\nAfter refining the frontend, craft a new Go artifact:\n```\ngo-bindata-assetfs -o template.go dist/ dist/assets/images/\n```\n\n\n# 📚 Contributing Best Practices\n\n> 📘 For frontend endeavors, do explore the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/tailwarden/komiser/tree/develop/dashboard#getting-started) in the `/dashboard` README.\n\nEmbarking on backend development? Here are golden practices to streamline your contributions and facilitate our review process:\n\n### 1. 🧪 Write Comprehensive Unit Tests\n- Every code change craves well-thought-out unit tests.\n- Leverage [Go's built-in testing framework](https://pkg.go.dev/testing) for this.\n- Seek inspiration from tests already enhancing the project.\n- 🚀 Before firing that pull request, run the entire test suite on your branch ensuring robust validation of your changes.\n\n### 2. 📖 Keep Documentation Updated\n- Newly added or tinkered features? Ensure the documentation mirrors your magic.\n\n### 3. 🎨 Prioritize Clean Code\n- Seal your changes with **`go fmt`** for a consistent code style.\n- Tools like **VSCode** come handy with plugins automating this formatting quest.\n\n### 4. 🖊 Mindful Code Comments\n- Complex logic?

The version format will follow the guidelines mentioned above, incorporating the principles of Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and our own additional standards.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures clarity and consistency in our versioning process, making it easier for users and enterprises to understand the significance of each release and determine when to upgrade.\n"
