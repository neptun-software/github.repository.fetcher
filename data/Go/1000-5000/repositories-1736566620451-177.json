If you see a piece of content that can be better, open a PR with an improvement, it doesn't matter how small!\n\nFor more detailed guidance on contributing to the documentation, check out the guide on the [docs website](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/contributing).\n\n## Setting up the development environment\n\nInstructions for setting the development environment can be found in the [developer guide](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/guides/dev/setting-up-dev-environment/).\n\nUseful make commands:\n\n| Command                                                   | Description |\n| ---                                                       |   ---      |\n| make install-go-tools generated-code -B                   | Makes all generated code which is required to get past CI. |\n| make glooctl                                              | Makes glooctl binary and places it in _output/glooctl |\n| make build-test-chart                                     | Makes the .tgz helm file that locally-built instances of glooctl require to install gloo |\n| make docker TAGGED_VERSION=(version)                      | Builds the docker images needed for the helm charts and tests |\n| make clean build-test-assets -B TAGGED_VERSION=v(version) | Builds a zipped helm chart for gloo that is configured to use the specified gloo version. This version must be a valid image in quay. This can include non-standard versions used for testing. |\n| make install-go-tools                                     | Updates the go dependencies |\n\n## Small bug fixes\n\nIf your bug fix is small (around 20 lines of code) just open a pull request. We will try to merge it as soon as possible,\njust make sure that you include a test that verifies the bug you are fixing.\n\n## Big PRs\n\nThis includes:\n\n- Big bug fixes\n- New features\n\nFor significant changes to the repository, it’s important to settle on a design before starting on the implementation. Reaching out to us early will help minimize the amount of possible wasted effort and will ensure that major improvements are given enough attention.\n\n1. **Open an issue.** Open an issue about your bug in this repo.\n2. **Message us on Slack.** Reach out to us to discuss your proposed changes.\n3. **Agree on implementation plan.** Write a plan for how this feature or bug fix should be implemented. Should this be one pull request or multiple incremental improvements? Who is going to do each part?\n4. **Submit a work-in-progress PR** It's important to get feedback as early as possible to ensure that any big improvements end up being merged. Submit a pull request and label it `work in progress` to start getting feedback.\n5. **Review.** At least one Solo team member should sign off on the change before it’s merged. Look at the “code review” section below to learn about what we're looking for.\n6. **A Solo team member will merge and release!**\n\n## Code review guidelines\n\nIt’s important that every piece of code in Gloo Gateway is reviewed by at least one Solo team member familiar with that codebase.\n\n1. **Changelog** Every PR in Gloo Gateway needs a changelog entry. For more information about changelogs, see the [readme](https://github.com/solo-io/go-utils/tree/main/changelogutils).\n2. **CI check** A Solo team member needs to kick off the CI process by commenting `/test` on your PR.\n3. **Testing** Please write tests for your changes. Bias towards fast / unit testing.\n4. **Comments** The code reviewer may leave comments to discuss changes. Minor preferences are often called out with `nit`.\n\n## Testing with coverage:\n\nTo see coverage, run your tests in the package like so\n\n```\nginkgo -cover && go tool cover -html *.coverprofile\n```\n"

It is being re-factored as part of the process.🚧\nPlease see [the plan](https://github.com/k8sgateway/k8sgateway/issues/10363) for more information and current status.\n\n## About K8sGateway\nK8sGateway is a feature-rich, fast, and flexible Kubernetes-native ingress controller and next-generation API gateway that is built on top of [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) and the Kubernetes Gateway API. It excels in function-level routing, supports legacy apps, microservices and serverless, offers robust discovery capabilities, integrates seamlessly with open-source projects, and is designed to support hybrid applications with various technologies, architectures, protocols, and clouds.\n\n[**Installation**](https://k8sgateway.io/docs/quickstart/) &nbsp; |\n&nbsp; [**Documentation**](https://k8sgateway.io/docs) &nbsp; |\n&nbsp; [**Blog**](https://k8sgateway.io/docs/) &nbsp; |\n&nbsp; [**Slack**](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C080D3PJMS4) &nbsp; |\n\n<BR><center><img align=\"center\" src=\"docs/content/img/k8sgateway/component-architecture.svg\" alt=\"K8sGateway Architecture\" width=\"700\"></center>\n\n### Using K8sGateway\n- **Kubernetes Gateway API**: K8sGateway is a feature-rich ingress controller, built on top of the Envoy Proxy and fully conformant with the Kubernetes Gateway API.\n- **Next-generation API gateway**: K8sGateway provides a long list of API gateway features including rate limiting, circuit breaking, retries, caching, transformation, service-mesh integration, security, external authentication and authorization.\n- **Hybrid apps**: K8sGateway creates applications that route to backends implemented as microservices, serverless functions and legacy apps. This feature can help users to\n  * Gradually migrate from their legacy code to microservices and serverless.\n  * Add new functionalities using cloud-native technologies while maintaining their legacy codebase.\n  * Allow different teams in an organization choose different architectures.\n\n<!---\nPLEASE DO NOT RENAME THIS SECTION\nThis header is used as an anchor in our CNCF Donation Issue\n-->\n### What makes K8sGateway unique\n- **Function-level routing allows integration of legacy applications, microservices and serverless**: K8sGateway can route requests directly to functions. Request to Function can be a serverless function call (e.g. Lambda, Google Cloud Function, OpenFaaS Function, etc.), an API call on a microservice or a legacy service (e.g. a REST API call, OpenAPI operation, XML/SOAP request etc.), or publishing to a message queue (e.g. NATS, AMQP, etc.). This unique ability is what makes K8sGateway the only API gateway that supports hybrid apps as well as the only one that does not tie the user to a specific paradigm.\n- **K8sGateway incorporates vetted open-source projects to provide broad functionality**: K8sGateway supports high-quality features by integrating with top open-source projects, including gRPC, OpenTracing, NATS and more. K8sGateway's architecture allows rapid integration of future popular open-source projects as they emerge.\n- **Full automated discovery lets users move fast**: Upon launch, K8sGateway creates a catalog of all available destinations and continuously keeps them up to date. This takes the responsibility for 'bookkeeping' away from the developers and guarantees that new features become available as soon as they are ready. K8sGateway discovers across IaaS, PaaS and FaaS providers as well as Swagger, and gRPC.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n- Join us on our Slack channel: [#k8sgateway](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C080D3PJMS4)\n- Check out the docs: [https://k8sgateway.io/docs](https://k8sgateway.io/docs)\n- Learn more about the [community](https://github.com/k8sgateway/community)\n\n## Contributing to K8sGateway\nThe [devel](devel) folder should be the starting point for understanding the code, and contributing to the product.\n\n## Thanks\n**K8sGateway** would not be possible without the valuable open-source work of projects in the community. We would like to extend a special thank-you to [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io).\n\n## Security\n*Reporting security issues* : We take K8sGateway's security very seriously. If you've found a security issue or a potential security issue in K8sGateway, please DO NOT file a public Github issue, instead follow the directions laid out in the [k8sgateway/community respository](https://github.com/k8sgateway/community/blob/main/CVE.md).\n"
