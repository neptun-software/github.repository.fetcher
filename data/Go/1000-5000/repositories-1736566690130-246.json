([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5304))\n\n## 0.18.1 (2024/11/21)\n### New and Improved\n\n* Delete terminated sessions in batches to avoid long running jobs.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5201))\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n* Fix an issue where users would lose access to managed groups if\n  there are more than 10,000 managed groups in the auth method used.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5242))\n* Fix an issue where only the first 10,000 members of a managed group\n  are returned when getting the managed group, and a similar issue where\n  only the first 10,000 managed groups an account is part of is included\n  when getting the account.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5245))\n\n## 0.18.0 (2024/10/01)\n### New and Improved\n\n* Add support for dynamic host catalog plugins running in Boundary workers:\n  Boundary plugins that handle dynamic host catalog operations (such as the\n  [AWS](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws/tree/main/plugin/service/host)\n  and [Azure](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-azure) plugins) can\n  now run on workers. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5137))\n\n* Dynamic host catalogs worker filter support (Enterprise and HCP Boundary\n  only): Operators can now set a worker filter when creating a dynamic host\n  catalog. When set, all of the plugin requests will be sent to the matching\n  worker for processing. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5137))\n\n* AWS dynamic host catalogs `AssumeRole` authentication support: Operators can\n  now set-up AWS dynamic host catalogs using Amazon's `AssumeRole`\n  authentication paradigm by providing a valid Role ARN when creating the host\n  catalog. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5137) and\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws/pull/49))\n\n* Improved MinIO storage plugin compatibility with other services by dropping\n  the checksum headers in `PutObject`.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-minio/pull/23))\n\n* ui: Add UI support for searching and pagination of aliases.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2498))\n\n* ui: Add UI support for filtering and pagination of session recordings.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2502))\n\n* ui: Improve multi-scope grants select/deselect process.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2435))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Prevented a data-race in Boundary's event logging system.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5139))\n\n* Update Storage Bucket type icon in Target view.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2503))\n\n* Allow user to retry with authentication is pending with OIDC.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2512))\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* Remove deprecated `controllers` field from the worker config, which was deprecated in 0.9.0 for\n`initial_upstreams`([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5125))\n\n## 0.17.2 (2024/09/25)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Improve performance of grants query by reducing the number of rows that need\n  to be returned.

([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5066))\n\n## 0.17.1 (2024/08/21)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Add `GetDownstreamWorkersTimeout` config option which represents the period of\n  time (as a duration) timeout for GetDownstreamWorkers call in\n  DownstreamWorkerTicker. This is currently not documented and considered\n  internal. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5007))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Fixed issue where storage policies were not deleted when scopes are deleted\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5014))\n* Contains Bug Fixes from 0.16.3\n\n### Security\n\n* Contains Security Fixes from 0.16.3\n\n## 0.16.3 (2024/08/21)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Add `GetDownstreamWorkersTimeout` config option which represents the period of\n  time (as a duration) timeout for GetDownstreamWorkers call in\n  DownstreamWorkerTicker. This is currently not documented and considered\n  internal. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5007))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Minio large file support: Disable multipart uploads via minio to fix an issue\n  where the file checksum is set incorrectly on each part of the upload, causing\n  it to fail. This change fixes file uploads larger than 16MB and limits upload\n  sizes to 5GB. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5013)) and\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-minio/pull/21))\n* Resolved an issue where session authorization was returning a `401` if the\n  alias is non-existent or the alias does not resolve to anything. A `404`\n  status code is now returned.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/5006)))\n\n### Security\n\n* curl (enterprise): The curl binary is no longer included in the published\n  Docker container images for Boundary Enterprise to address the CVE-2024-7264\n  vulnerability.\n  [CVE-2024-7264](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-97c4-2w4v-c7r8)  \n\n## 0.17.0 (2024/07/17)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* SBC (Storage Bucket Credential): This release introduces, SBC, a resource that\nrepresents credentials for authentication and authorization with an external\nobject store. There are two SBC types, managed secret and environmental.\n([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4933)),\n([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-minio/pull/18)) and\n([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws/pull/46))\n  * SBC State: This release introduces, SBC State, which represents the ability\n  for a worker to perform a specific action using the storage bucket. SBC\n  permission types (write, read, & delete) represent an action that is required\n  for the storage bucket to do as a routine task on an external object store.\n  Each permission type has a permission state (ok, error, unknown). \n  * SBC Worker Filtering: For protocol aware workers that require interaction\n  with an external storage service, the workers will be filtered by the SBC\n  state depending on the action and permission required.\n* ui: Add multiple grant scope support for roles\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2388))\n* ui: Add API tags support for workers and improve worker filtering for targets\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2393))\n* Updated grpc to 1.61.1([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4983))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n## 0.16.2 (2024/06/10)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Updated Minio plugin to allow for potential use with other S3-compatible\nstorage providers.\n([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-minio/pull/16)) and\n([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-minio/pull/17))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Fixed a bug where a worker credential rotation request suceeded on the\ncontroller but the response to the worker was lost. This resulted in the\ncontroller using a separate set of credentials than the worker, causing the\nworker to be unable to connect to the controller. The fix implements the new\nnodeenrollment library NodeIdLoader interface, which ensures that on store, if\nworker NodeInformation has a previous key set, the worker will check and correct\nits stored credential set to match. LodeNodeInformation was also updated to fix\na bug where in this split credential scenario, the current credential key was\nassumed to be the incoming worker key, which caused the wrong key information to\nbe populated for the key id.\n([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4870))\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Allow descriptions to contain newlines and other whitespace\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2599))\n* Listed roles contain grant scope ID information\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4893))\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* The `grant_scope_id` field on roles, which was deprecated in 0.15.0, has been removed.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4886))\n\n## 0.16.1 (2024/05/30)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* The observation tag was added to session recording and storage bucket proto messages for telemetry purposes. If you enable telemetry and observation events, Boundary will now collect data about session recording and storage buckets.\n([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4824)) and ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4825))\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* The `boundary daemon` command has been deprecated in favor of the new\n  `boundary cache` command. The behavior remains the same. The `boundary search`\n  command is unchanged.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4808))\n* The include_terminated field in the list sessions request will be removed\n  in an upcoming release. After the deprecation process is complete and the\n  field is removed terminated sessions will be returned\n  in all list session responses unless filtered out using the filter field.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4602))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Fix a dead lock issue where the controller could get stuck with all of its\n  available database connections being stuck in `idle in transaction`.\n  If a controller is configured to have a `max_open_connections`, and was under\n  sufficient load in the form of requests from workers interacting with\n  sessions, like in the form of authorizing new session connections, the\n  controller could get stuck after consuming all of the database connections,\n  leaving them in the `idle in transaction` state. This was due to a\n  combination of issues, including the lack of a request timeout for worker to\n  controller grpc requests, and the session repository attempting to use a\n  separate database connection to retrieve a kms.Wrapper after already starting\n  a database transaction. The fixes move these kms operations outside of the\n  transaction and set a max request duration for the grpc requests based on\n  the cluster's listener configuration.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4803) and\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4805))\n* LDAP account attribute maps. Account attribute maps have been supported since\n  the introduction of LDAP authentication, however a bug was present where we\n  wouldn't take those into account upon authenticating (when receiving the\n  information from the LDAP server). This is now resolved\n  ([PR]((https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4788))).\n\n## 0.16.0 (2024/04/30)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Target aliases have been added: You can now create an alias for a target. In\n  most situations where you would use a target id, you can now instead use the\n  alias value. Create an alias with `boundary aliases create target -value\n  example.boundary -destination-id ttcp_1234567890` and connect to a target\n  using an alias using `boundary connect example.boundary`\n* Worker local storage state: Self managed workers that are configured to be\n  used for session recordings will report the state of the its disk space. To\n  learn more about this new feature, refer to the\n  [documentation](http://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/create-storage-bucket#local-storage).\n* MinIO storage plugin: You can now create a storage bucket that allows Boundary\n  to interoperate with a MinIO cluster for Session Recording storage. This\n  includes some added functionality such as credential rotation and credential\n  management. To learn more about the plugin, refer to the\n  [readme](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-minio?tab=readme-ov-file#minio-plugin-for-hashicorp-boundary).\n  *Note:* Due to a library incompatibility, this release is not yet compatible\n  with the `netbsd` operating system. Please refer to the following\n  [documentation](http://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording/create-storage-bucket)\n  to learn how to create a storage bucket.\n* ui: Add UI support for filtering and pagination\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2237))\n* ui: Add UI support for MinIO (Enterprise and HCP Boundary only)\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2248))\n\n### Added dependency\n\n* postgres `citext` dependency added to enable aliases to be globally unique in\n  a case insensitive way.\n\n## 0.15.4 (2024/04/09)\n\n### Security\n\n* Go version bumped to 1.22.2 to address\n  [CVE-2023-45288](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m)\n\n## 0.15.3 (2024/03/21)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Fix a nil pointer error in the client cache daemon when a refresh was forced\n  performing a boundary search.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4503))\n* workers: Workers connecting over high latency connections, or to controllers\n  with high latency between the controller and the database, could time out and\n  throw errors that may not have been recoverable if it was during initial\n  registration ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4535))\n* Resolved an issue introduced in 0.14 where, after successfully deleting an AWS S3\n  Storage Bucket with credential rotation enabled, Boundary could not delete the\n  associated IAM Access Key resource\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* templating: A new templating function `coalesce` can be used to match a\n  template against multiple possible values, returning the first non-empty\n  value. As an example, this can be used in a credential library to allow a\n  username value that might be comprised of a name or login name depending on\n  the auth method, e.g. `{{ coalesce .Account.Name .Account.LoginName}}`\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4492)))\n\n## 0.15.2 (2024/03/11)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Go version bump 1.21.8 to address (CVE-2024-24783, CVE-2023-45290,\n  CVE-2023-45289, CVE-2024-24785, CVE-2024-24784)\n\n* Protobuf Go update to address [CVE-2024-24786](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8r3f-844c-mc37)\n\n## 0.15.1 (2024/02/28)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* cli: Update proxy listener to not close when the number of connections left\n  for the session is zero. The listener will refuse new connections when the\n  number of connections left is zero but existing connections will be active.\n  This fixes a CLI client issue where sessions with max connection count\n  configured were closed when the number of connections left hit 0.\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/4364),\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4389)))\n* Fix issue where the websocket connection was throwing closing errors during\n  the session teardown.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4389))\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* feat: support added for tracking and reporting monthly active users for\n  the purpose of billing. It adds a new API endpoint,\n  `/v1/billing:monthly-active-users` and new cli command,\n  `boundary billing monthly-active-users` that can be used to view the monthly\n  active user counts.\n\n## 0.15.0 (2024/01/30)\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* Per the note in Boundary 0.13.0, the previous `kms` worker method has been\n  removed. Since 0.13.0, unless the `use_deprecated_kms_auth_method` value was\n  set on the worker config, the new `kms` mechanism was already being used; this\n  is simply no longer an available option.\n* Per the notes in Boundary 0.12.0 and 0.14.0, it is now an error if an address\n  on a host or target contains a port. As of this release, this restriction also\n  affects existing addresses (not just creation/updating via the API) so any\n  existing addresses containing a port will not be able to be used as part of a\n  target's session authorization call.\n* The `grant_scope_id` field on roles is now deprecated in favor of the multiple\n  grant scope support.\n* Per the note in Boundary 0.13.1, the `id` field in grants has changed to `ids`\n  which allows multiple ids to be included; existing grants submitted to\n  Boundary will continue to work, but grants using \"id\" can no longer be added\n  to or set on a role.\n* All list endpoints except workers now return the first 1000 items instead\n  of all items if no parameters are provided. The number of items returned can\n  be configured through the new controller configuration value `max_page_size`.\n  The Admin UI, CLI and api package automatically paginate results.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Multiple grant scopes in roles: Roles now support multiple grant scopes, along\n  with the special values `this`, `children` (global/org only) to apply to all\n  direct children of a scope, and `descendants` (global only) to apply to all\n  descendants of a scope. These use the new actions `add-grant-scopes`,\n  `set-grant-scopes`, and `remove-grant-scopes` on roles. For now the\n  `grant_scope_id` field on roles will continue to be able to be set, which will\n  set a single grant scope, but this capability is now deprecated.\n* Policies (Enterprise and HCP Boundary only): This release introduces Policies, a\n  Boundary resource that represents a Governance Policy to enforce. The first\n  implementation targets Storage Policies, which enables administrators to automate\n  the process of retention and deletion of Session Recordings, ensuring that they're only\n  retaining data that is explicitly required from a security/compliance perspective.\n  * ui: Add full UI support for Storage Policies managing the lifecycle of Session Recordings.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/2089))\n* New generic commands `read`, `update`, and `delete` have been added. These\n  allow operating on resources by directly specifying the ID of the resource as\n  the next parameter (e.g. `boundary update ttcp_1234567890`). Subtypes do not\n  need to be specified (e.g. that command is equivalent to `boundary targets\n  update tcp -id ttcp_1234567890`), and any flags given after the ID are passed\n  through to the type-specific subcommand. Once the ID has been entered,\n  autocomplete is also supported.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3992))\n* The `key_id` parameter within SSH Certificate Credential Libraries now accepts\n  the use of templated parameters\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4215))\n* List endpoint pagination: All list endpoints except workers now support pagination.\n  * api: All list endpoints except workers have added support for pagination.\n    The api package automatically paginates until the end of the results. The new\n    `WithListToken`` option can be used to request a list of updated and deleted resources\n    relative to the last result received.\n  * config: add new controller field `max_page_size` for controlling the default and max size\n    of pages when paginating through results.\n* New command `search` has been added allowing quick searching of targets or\n  sessions. It utilizes a client side cache also added in this release. The\n  client side cache starts itself automatically in the background when successfully\n  executing any command that communicates with a Boundary controller. To disable\n  the client cache from starting automatically set the\n  `BOUNDARY_SKIP_CACHE_DAEMON` environment variable or pass the\n  `-skip-cache-daemon` flag when running a command that may start it.\n  Commands `daemon start`, `daemon stop`, `daemon status`, and `daemon add-token`\n  were added to help manage the cache. The cache does not currently work with\n  Boundary instances that require the use of client side certs.\n\n## 0.14.3 (2023/12/12)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Added the ability to enforce rate limits on the Controller API. This version\n  enables rate limits by default. For details on the default rate limits,\n  how to configure rate limits, and how to disable rate limiting see the\n  noted PR. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4092))\n* Add support for OIDC prompts. Using prompts, the Relying Party (RP) can\n  customize the authentication and authorization flow to suit their specific\n  needs and improve the user experience. [OIDC Authentication request]\n  (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest) server.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4053))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* Update go-kms-wrapping/extras/kms dependency to allow external wrappers\n  without a key id to be used within a KMS config stanza.  Note: this fix allows\n  GCP KMS keys to be again with Boundary, which had stopped working in v0.13.0.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/4058))\n\n* Two Vault client settings were not being properly used when constructing a\n  Vault client. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3973))\n\n  The `TLS Skip Verify` setting was only being set if a `CA Cert` was also\n  configured. This fix sets the `TLS Skip Verify` when configured regardless of\n  other settings.\n\n  The `TLS Server Name` setting was never being set. Bad programmers. This fix\n  now sets it on the Vault client if the Vault Credential Store has been\n  configured to use a value for this setting.\n\n### Security\n\n* deps: Bump Go version to v1.21.5. This is to address multiple security\n  vulnerabilities. Most notable for boundary is a fix in net/http to limit\n  chunked data overhead. See https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/iLGK3x6yuN\n\n## 0.14.2 (2023/11/2)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Expose Valid Principals for Vault SSH Signed Certs: Allow users to add\n  additional valid principals when creating a vault ssh signed cert credential\n  library ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3791)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* High CPU consumption: A background GRPC connection state check caused high CPU\n  utilization. This was caused by a long running loop that was checking for GRPC\n  connection state changes between a worker and an upstream connection address.\n  The loop was not correctly waiting for GRPC connection state changes before\n  running. The issue was fixed by correctly updating the state that determines\n  when the loop in GRPC connection state check should run.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3884))\n* LDAP auth methods: Fix encoding of mTLS client key which prevented Boundary\n  from making mTLS connections to an LDAP server\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/3927),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3929)).\n\n## 0.14.1 (2023/10/17)\n\n### Security\n\n* deps: Bump Go version to v1.21.3; gRPC to v1.58.3; golang.org/x/net to\n  v0.17.0. This is to address a security vulnerability in the HTTP stack where a\n  malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets\n  them can cause excessive server resource consumption.\n\n## 0.14.0 (2023/10/10)\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* Per the note in Boundary 0.12.0, the `vault` credential library subtype has\n  now been removed in favor of `vault-generic`. For example, instead of\n  `boundary credential-libraries create vault`, you must use `boundary\n  credential-libraries create vault-generic`.\n* Per the note in Boundary 0.12.0, errors returned from the cli when using the\n  `-format=json` option will now only use the `status_code` field. The `status`\n  field has been removed.\n* Per the note in Boundary 0.12.0, targets require a default port value. Ports\n  defined as part of a host address were ignored but allowed as part of a target\n  definition; from 0.14.0 onwards, any port defined on a host address will now\n  become an error.\n* Targets: Per the note in Boundary 0.10.10, target Application Credentials has\n  been renamed to Brokered Credentials. `application-credential-source` has been\n  removed as a field. `brokered-credential-source` should be used instead.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3728), [deprecated\n  changelog](#0100-20220810)).\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* cli: Add support for specifying a command that will be executed on the remote host when\n  using the `boundary connect ssh` subcommand.\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/3631),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3633)).\n* feat: add API support for additional LDAP auth method fields:\n  `maximum_page_size` and `dereference_aliases`\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3679)).\n* feat: add worker upstream connection status to ops health check\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3650)).\n* feat: allow HCP cluster id to be sourced from file or env variable\n    ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3709)).\n* feat: add support for telemetry events via flag or Boundary configuration\n  (requires observation events to be enabled). Deny filter now filters\n  coordination worker status from observation events by default. (This behavior\n  is overridden by any user specified allow or deny filters)\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3753)).\n* ui: Add full UI support for LDAP auth method\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1782))\n* ui: Add new attribute fields to storage bucket to support the assume role service in AWS.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1901))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* LDAP auth methods: allow bind-dn and bind-password to be updated\n  independently. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3511))\n* targets: Fix address field not being populated if the number of targets on a\n  list returns more than 10000 entries\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3644))\n* cli: Fix issue when using the `authenticate` command against a password auth\n  method on Windows where the password would be swallowed when the login name is\n  submitted ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3800))\n* worker: Fix an issue that could cause intermittent startup issues on slow\n  systems ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3803))\n* cli: Remove websocket max message size. This fixes issues where large message\n  sizes are sent to the client from a worker which resulted in the connection\n  being terminated, as is the case with an scp download when using an SSH\n  Target. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3808))\n\n## 0.13.5 (2023/12/12) (Enterprise and HCP Boundary only)\n\n### Security\n\n* deps: Bump Go version to v1.21.5. This is to address multiple security\n  vulnerabilities. Most notable for boundary is a fix in net/http to limit\n  chunked data overhead. See https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/iLGK3x6yuN\n\n## 0.13.1 (2023/07/10)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* roles: In grants, the `id` field has been changed to `ids` (but `id` will\n  still be accepted for now, up until 0.15.0). In the `ids` field, multiple IDs\n  can now be specified in a grant, either via commas (text format) or array\n  (JSON format). ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3263)).\n* dev environment: When running `boundary dev` the initial LDAP auth-method with an\n  ID of `amldap_1234567890` is now in a public-active state, so it will be returned\n  in the response from `boundary auth-methods list`\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* Grants can now accept more than one ID per grant string (or entry in JSON) via\n  the `ids` parameter. In 0.15.0 the ability to add new grants via the `id`\n  parameter will be removed.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* PKI worker authentication: A worker authentication record can be stored more than once, if it matches the\n  existing record for that worker auth key ID. Fixes an edge case where a worker attempted authorization\n  and the controller successfully stored the worker auth record but went down before returning authorization\n  details to the worker. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3389))\n* LDAP managed groups: adding/setting/removing a principal to a role now works\n  properly when it's an LDAP managed group.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3361) and\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3363))\n\n## 0.13.0 (2023/06/13)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* SSH Session Recordings (Enterprise and HCP Boundary only): SSH targets can now\n  be configured to record sessions. Recordings are signed and stored in a\n  Storage Bucket. Recordings can be played back in the admin UI.\n  * Storage Buckets: This release introduces Storage Buckets, a Boundary\n    resource that represents a bucket in an external object store. Storage\n    Buckets can be defined at the global or org scope. When associated with an\n    SSH target, the storage bucket is used to store session recordings. This\n    release includes support for AWS S3 only.\n  * BSR (Boundary Session Recording) file format: BSR is a new specification\n    that defines a hierarchical directory structure of files and a binary file\n    format. The contents of a BSR include all data transmitted between a user\n    and a target during a single session, relevant session metadata and summary\n    information. The BSR also includes checksum and signature files for\n    cryptographically verifying BSR contents, and a set of KMS wrapped keys for\n    use in BSR verification. The BSR format is intended to be extensible to\n    support various protocols. With this release BSR supports the SSH protocol.\n    It also supports converting an SSH channel recording into an\n    [asciicast](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/doc/asciicast-v2.md)\n    format that is playable by asciinema.\n  * To learn more about this new feature, refer to the\n    [documentation](http://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/configuration/session-recording).\n* KMS workers: KMS workers now have feature parity with PKI workers (they\n  support multi-hop and Vault private access) and support separate KMSes for\n  authenticating downstreams across different networks. See the [worker\n  configuration\n  documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/configuration/worker)\n  for more information. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3101))\n* roles: Perform additional validity checking on grants at submission time\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3081))\n* targets: The new `default_client_port` field allows specifying the default\n  port to use on the client side when connecting to a target, unless overridden\n  by the client via `-listen-port`\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2767))\n* cli/api/sdk: New LDAP auth method type added with support for create, read,\n  update, delete, and list (see new cli `ldap` subcommands available on CRUDL\n  operations for examples), as well as the ability to authenticate against it\n  via the SDK, CLI, admin UI, and desktop client.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2912))\n* ui: Display external names when listing dynamic hosts ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1664))\n* ui: Add support for LDAP authentication ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1645))\n* Dynamic Host Catalog: You can now view the AWS or Azure host name when listing hosts in CLI,\n  admin console, and desktop client. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3074))\n* Add configuration for license reporting (Enterprise only)\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* With the introduction of the new KMS variant for worker registration (as\n  described below), using the deprecated behavior requires opting-in. This is\n  only recommended if compatibility with pre-0.13 workers using the KMS auth\n  method is required. Requiring opting in removes some potentially confusing\n  behavior for deciding when to use the old versus new mechanism. To opt in, add\n  `use_deprecated_kms_auth_method = true` to the `worker` config block. Note\n  that if a 0.13+ worker using KMS connects to a 0.13+ controller using KMS, the\n  transition to the new method will happen automatically. To go back to the old\n  method after that will require the worker to be deleted and re-added with the\n  `use_deprecated_kms_auth_method` config field specified.\n* When grants are added to roles additional validity checking is now performed.\n  This extra validity checking is designed to reject grants that are not\n  [documented grant\n  formats](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions/permission-grant-formats)\n  or are for combinations of IDs and types that cannot actually be used\n  together. These previously would have been accepted without error but would\n  never result in permissions being granted, causing confusion. As a result,\n  attempting to write such grants into roles may now result in an error; the\n  error message gives hints for resolution.\n* `WithAutomaticVersioning` for auth tokens in Go SDK: this option was\n  incorrectly being generated for auth token resources, which do not support\n  versioning. This is technically a breaking change, but it was a no-op option\n  anyways that there was no reason to be using. It has now been removed.\n* Plugins: With the introduction of the storage plugin service, the Azure and AWS Host plugin\n  repositories have been renamed to drop the `host` element of the repository name:\n\n   - https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-host-aws -> https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws\n   - https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-host-azure -> https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-azure\n\n  Similarly the `plugins/host` package has been renamed to `plugins/boundary`\n  ([PR1](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3262),\n  [PR2](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws/pull/24),\n  [PR3](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-azure/pull/12),\n  [PR4](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3266)).\n* PostgreSQL 12 or greater is now required. PostgreSQL 11 is no longer\n  supported.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* targets: `authorize-session` now works properly when using a target's name as\n  the identifier and the target name contains one or more slashes\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3249))\n* resource listing: API requests to list a resource (targets, sessions, users,\n  etc) now properly return all resources the callers has appropriate permission\n  to list ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3278))\n* sessions: Fix a bug that contributed to slow response times when listing\n  sessions that had a large number of connections\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3280))\n* ui: Fix `client secret` bug for OIDC authentication methods([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1698))\n* ui: Fix linking to a Host from the Host Set screen of a Dynamic Host Catalog ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1659))\n\n## 0.12.3 (2023/05/26)\n\nNote: As this issue currently only affected HCP Boundary customers, there is no\nopen-source release of 0.12.3; the same fixes will be in 0.13.0 OSS.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* workers: A bug in PKI worker auth rotation could mean that after a rotation\n  the controller (or upstream worker) and downstream worker side could pick\n  different certificate chains for authentication, with the only remedy being to\n  re-authorize the workers. This has been fixed. If this bug was previously hit,\n  in some specific cases updating only the worker to 0.12.3 will fix it;\n  otherwise reauthorization will be necessary.\n\n## 0.12.2 (2023/04/04)\n\n### Security\n\n* Boundary now uses Go 1.19.8 to address CVE-2023-24536. See the\n  [Go announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8) for\n  more details.\n\n## 0.12.1 (2023/03/13)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* cli: Fix fallback parsing of un-typed credentials for `boundary connect`.\n  When using a vault credential library with no credential type set, boundary\n  will perform a best effort attempt to parse any brokered credentials. If the\n  credentials are successfully parsed, they can be used by the subprocess\n  spawned when using the connect subcommands, i.e. `ssh` or `psql`. With the\n  change to the vault credential library subtype, this fallback parsing would\n  fail. Note that if the credential library has a credential type, by using\n  `-credential-type` when creating the credential library, the credential was\n  correctly parsed. This fallback parsing is now fixed, but in order to support\n  older clients, credential libraries will need to be recreated with a\n  credential type. [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2989)\n* ui: Fix credential library not saving correctly when trying to save it as a\n  generic secrets type. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1640))\n* sessions: Fix tofu token retrieval. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/3064))\n\n## 0.12.0 (2023/01/24)\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* In Boundary 0.9.0, targets were updated to require a default port value. This\n  had been the original intention; it was a mistake that it was optional.\n  Unfortunately, due to a separate defect in the update verification logic for\n  static hosts, it was possible for a host to be updated (but not created) with\n  a port. This meant that targets could use ports attached to host addresses,\n  which was not the intention and leads to confusing behavior across different\n  installations. In this version, updating static hosts will no longer allow\n  ports to be part of the address; when authorizing a session, any port on such\n  a host will be ignored in favor of the default port on the target. In Boundary\n  0.14.0, this will become an error instead. As a consequence, it means that the\n  fallback logic for targets that did not have a default port defined is no\n  longer in service; all targets must now have a default port defined.\n* With the introduction of `vault-ssh-certificate` credential libraries, the\n  `vault` credential library subtype is being renamed to `vault-generic` to\n  denote it as a credential library that can be used in a generalized way to\n  issue credentials from vault. Existing credential libraries with the\n  subtype of `vault` will be updated to `vault-generic`. The subtype of\n  `vault` will still be accepted as a valid subtype in API requests to the\n  credential libraries endpoints, but is deprecated. Instead `vault-generic`\n  should be used. In addition the `boundary credential-libraries create\n  vault` and `boundary credential-libraries update vault` subcommands will\n  still function, but are deprecated. Instead `boundary credential-libraries\n  create vault-generic` and `boundary credential-libraries update\n  vault-generic` should be used. Also note that any credential library created\n  using the subtype of `vault`, either via the API or via the deprecated\n  subcommand, will have the subtype set to `vault-generic`. The deprecated\n  subtype and subcommands will be removed in boundary 0.14.0, at which point\n  `vault-generic` must be used.\n* In Boundary 0.1.8 using the `-format=json` option with the cli would provide\n  a `status_code` for successful API requests from the cli. However, in the\n  case where an error was returned, the JSON would use `status` instead. This\n  inconsistency has been fixed, with `status_code` being used in both cases.\n  For error cases `status` will still be populated, but is deprecated and will\n  be removed in 0.14.0.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Direct Address Targets: You can now set an address directly on a target,\n  bypassing the need for host catalogs, host sets and hosts.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2613))\n* Custom Response Headers: Adds ability to set api and ui response headers based\n  on status code. Includes default secure CSP and other headers.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2587))\n* metrics: Adds accepted connections and closed connections counters to keep track\n  downstream connections for worker and controller servers.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2668))\n* Egress and Ingress worker filters: The target `worker_filter` field has been deprecated and\n replaced with egress and ingress worker filters. Egress worker filters determine which workers are\n used to access targets. Ingress worker filters (HCP Boundary only) determine which workers are\n used to connect with a client to initiate a session. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2654))\n* Multi-Hop Sessions (HCP Boundary only): Multi-hop PKI workers can communicate with each other to serve\n 2 primary purposes: authentication and session proxying. This results in the ability to chain\n multiple workers together to access services hidden under layers of network security. Multi-hop\n workers can also establish a TCP session through multiple workers, with the ability to reverse\n proxy and establish a connection.\n* Vault SSH certificate credential library: A new credential library that uses\n  the vault ssh secret engine to generate ssh private key and certificates. The\n  library can be used as an injected application credential source for targets\n  that support credential injection. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2860))\n* ui: Add support for managed groups in add-principals list.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1548))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* plugins: Ignore `SIGHUP` sent to parent process; some init systems, notably\n  `dumb-init`, would pass them along to the child processes and cause the\n  plugin to exit ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2677))\n* data warehouse: Fix bug that caused credential dimensions to not get\n    associated with session facts ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2787)).\n* sessions: Fix two authorizeSession race conditions in handleProxy. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2795))\n* cli: When using `-format=json` the JSON was inconsistent in how it reported\n  status codes. In successful cases it would use `status_code`, but in error\n  cases it would use `status`. Now `status_code` is used in both cases. In\n  error cases `status` is still populated, see the deprecations above for\n  more details. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2887))\n* database: Add job that automatically cleans up completed runs in the `job_run` table.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2866))\n* core: Linux packages now have vendor label and set the default label to HashiCorp.\n  This fix is implemented for any future releases, but will not be updated for historical releases.\n\n## 0.11.2 (2022/12/09)\n\n### Security\n\n* Boundary now uses Go 1.19.4 to address security vulnerability (CVE-2022-41717) See the\n  [Go announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/L_3rmdT0BMU) for\n  more details.\n\n## 0.11.1 (2022/11/30)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Vault Parameter Templating: In `vault` credential libraries, the paths and any\n  POST bodies can contain templated parameters using Go template syntax (similar\n  to Consul-Template). The following template parameters are supported (note\n  that account values are tied to the account associated with the token making\n  the call):\n    * `{{ .User.Id }}`: the user's ID\n    * `{{ .User.Name }}`: the user's name (from the user resource)\n    * `{{ .User.FullName }}`: the user's name (from the account corresponding to\n    the primary auth method in the user's scope; this may not be populated or\n    maybe different than the account name in the template)\n    * `{{ .User.Email }}`: the user's email address (same caveat as `FullName`)\n    * `{{ .Account.Id }}`: the account's ID\n    * `{{ .Account.Name }}`: the account's name (from the account resource)\n    * `{{ .Account.LoginName }}`: the account's login name (if used by that type\n    of account)\n    * `{{ .Account.Subject }}`: the account's subject (if used by that type\n    of account)\n    * `{{ .Account.Email }}`: the account's email (if used by that type\n    of account)\n\n    Additionally, there is currently a single function that strips the rest of a\n    string after a specified substring; this is useful for pulling an user/account name from an email address. In the following example it uses the account email can be any other parameter:\n\n    * `{{ truncateFrom .Account.Email \"@\" }}`: this would turn `foo@example.com` into `foo`\n* Per-scope key lifecycle management: You can now manage the lifecycles of both Key\n  Encryption Keys (KEKs) and Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) using the new key rotation\n  and key version destruction functionality. To learn more about this new feature,\n  refer to the\n  [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/security/data-encryption).\n\n  Upgrade notice: If the Database purpose DEK for a scope is destroyed, you must use\n  the API to cancel any sessions that predate the upgrade.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2477))\n* session: The amount of bytes received and transmitted over a session\n  is now recorded and persisted. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2503))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* accounts: Deleted auth accounts would still show up as being associated with a\n  User when reading the User\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2528))\n* sessions: Fix workers not being in random order when returned to clients at\n  `authorize-session` time, which could allow one worker to bear the majority of\n  sessions ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2544))\n* workers: In some error conditions when sending status to controllers, errors\n  could be written to stdout along with a message that they could not\n  successfully be evented instead of being written to the event log\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2544))\n* workers: Fixed a panic that can happen in certain situations\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2553))\n* sessions: Fixed a panic in a controller when a worker is deleted while\n  sessions are ongoing ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2612))\n* sessions: Fixed a panic in a worker when a user with an active\n  session is deleted ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2629))\n* sessions: Fixed a bug where reading a session after its associated project\n  had been deleted would result in an error\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2615))\n* config: Fixed a bug where supplying multiple KMS blocks with the same purpose\n  would silently ignore all but the last block\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2639))\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* In order to standardize on the templating format, [templates in\n  grants](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions/permission-grant-formats#templates)\n  now are documented to use the new capitalization and format; however, the\n  previous style will continue to work.\n\n## 0.11.0 (2022/09/27)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* PKI workers in past versions did not store a prior encryption key, and a bug\n  prior to 0.11.0 meant that auth rotations could happen more frequently than\n  expected. This could cause some race issues around rotation time. However,\n  there was another issue where a past worker authentication record could be\n  looked up for some operations instead of the current one, made more likely by\n  the too-frequent rotations. In 0.11.0 we attempt to ensure that the record\n  that remains on upgrade is the most current one, but it is possible that the\n  wrong one is chosen, leading to a failure for the worker to authenticate or\n  for some operations to consistently fail. In this case, the worker will need\n  to be deleted and re-authorized. We apologize for any issues this causes and\n  this should be remedied going forward.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* scopes: Organizations could be prevented from being deleted if some resources\n  remained ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2465))\n* workers: Authentication rotation could occur prior to the expected time\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2484))\n* workers: When looking up worker authentication records, an old record could be\n  returned instead of the new one, leading to errors for encryption or\n  decryption operations ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2495))\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* vault: (HCP Boundary only): Private Vault clusters can be used with HCP Boundary by using PKI workers\n  deployed in the same network as a private cluster. Tags are used to control which PKI workers can manage private Vault\n  requests by specifying a `worker_filter` attribute when configuring a Vault credential store.\n* credentials: There is now a `json` credential type supported by `static`\n  credential stores that allows submitting a generic JSON object to Boundary for\n  use with credential brokering workflows\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2423))\n* ui: Add support for worker management\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1229))\n* ui: Add support for PKI worker registration\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1244))\n* ui: Add support for Static Credential Stores\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1193))\n* ui: Add support for Username & Password Credentials\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1205))\n* ui: Add support for Username & Key Pair Credentials\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1266))\n* ui (HCP Boundary only): SSH Target creation along with injected application\n  credential support ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1027))\n* ui (HCP Boundary only): Update vault credential stores to support private\n  vault access ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1318))\n* ui: Improve quick setup wizard onboarding guide resource names\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1328))\n* ui: Updates to host catalog and host set forms and “Learn More” links\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1342))\n* workers: Added the ability to read and reinitialize the Worker certificate\n  authority ([PR1](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2312),\n  [PR2](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2387))\n* workers: Return the worker Boundary binary version on worker list and read\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2377))\n* workers: Addition of worker graceful shutdown, triggered by an initial\n  `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2455))\n* workers: Retain one previous encryption/decryption key after authentication\n  rotation ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2495))\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* In 0.5.0, the `add-host-sets`, `remove-host-sets`, and `set-host-sets` actions\n  on targets were deprecated in favor of `add-host-sources`,\n  `remove-host-sources`, and `set-host-sources`. Originally these actions and\n  API calls were to be removed in 0.6, but this was delayed to give extra time\n  for clients to switch over. This has now been fully switched over. A database\n  migration will modify any grants in roles to have the new actions. This same\n  changeover has been made for `add-/remove-/set-credential-libraries` to\n  `add-/remove-/set-credential-sources`, although those actions would only be in\n  grant strings in very rare circumstances as the `-sources` actions replaced\n  the `-libraries` actions very quickly.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2393))\n\n## 0.10.5 (2022/09/13)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* There is bug that prevents deleting an org in some circumstances. This can be\n  worked around by first deleting all projects in the org, then deleting the\n  org. This will be fixed in 0.11.0.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* grants: Properly resolve \"only self\" for permissions. When generating\n  permissions from grants, if a single grant was limited only to a set of \"self\"\n  actions and that was the last grant parsed (which would be semi-random\n  depending on a number of factors), the overall set of permissions would be\n  marked as only-self. This would result in the generated permissions being more\n  limiting then they should be based on the grants. This only impacts the\n  sessions list endpoint. It would result in users that have been granted access\n  to list other user's sessions to be unable to see these sessions in the list\n  results ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2448)).\n\n## 0.10.4 (2022/09/13)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* There is bug that prevents deleting an org in some circumstances. This can be\n  worked around by first deleting all projects in the org, then deleting the\n  org. This will be fixed in 0.11.0.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Controller-led worker authorization: This is a second authorization option for\n  the workers using PKI-based authentication that was introduced in Boundary\n  0.10.0. In 0.10.0, the only mode available was \"worker-led\", in which a worker\n  generates an authorization request which can be submitted to a controller to\n  authorize the worker. With this new controller-led flow, a worker can be\n  created via the controller API first and return a one-time-use authorization\n  token. This token can then be made available to the worker at startup time via\n  its configuration file, env var, or a file with the value. If the worker is\n  not authorized and this token is provided, it will use the token to authorize\n  itself to the controller and set up PKI-based authentication.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2413))\n* Initial upstreams reloading on `SIGHUP`: Workers will now re-read the\n  `initial_upstreams` value from the configuration file when given a SIGHUP.\n  This allows a worker to reconnect to controllers if the full set of\n  controllers has been changed over at the same time, without having to restart\n  the worker. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2417))\n* Database URL reloading on `SIGHUP`: Controllers will now re-read the database\n    url value from the configuration file when given a SIGHUP. This is\n    particularly useful for allowing database credentials to rotate and\n    signaling the controller to use the new credentials without the need for a\n    restart.

This will be fixed shortly in 0.10.1.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* `ssh` Target Type With Credential Injection (HCP Boundary only): Boundary has\n  gained a new `ssh` target type. Using this type, username/password or SSH\n  private key credentials can be sourced from `vault` credential libraries or\n  `static` credentials and injected into the SSH session between a client and\n  end host. This allows users to securely SSH to remote hosts while never being\n  in possession of a valid credential for that target host.\n* SSH Private Key Credentials: There is now an `ssh_private_key` credential type\n  that allows submitting a username/private key (and optional passphrase) to\n  Boundary for use with credential injection or brokering workflows.\n* `boundary connect ssh` Credential Brokering Enhancements: we have extended\n  support into the `boundary connect ssh` helper for brokered credentials of\n  `ssh_private_key` type; the command will automatically pass the credentials to\n  the `ssh` process ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2267)).\n* `boundary authenticate`, `boundary accounts`: Enables use of `env://` and\n  `file://` syntax to specify location of a password\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2325))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* cli: Correctly cleanup plugins after exiting `boundary dev`, `boundary server`\n  and `boundary database init`\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/2332),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2333)).\n* `boundary accounts change-password`: Fixed being prompted for confirmation of\n  the current password instead of the new one\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2325))\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* API Module: Changed the return types that reference interfaces into their\n  expected typed definition. Type casting is only allowed against interface\n  types, therefore to mitigate compiler errors please remove any type casting\n  done against the return values.\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/2122),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2238))\n* Targets: Rename Application credentials to Brokered credentials\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2260)).\n* Host plugins: Plugin-type host catalogs/sets/hosts now use typed prefixes for\n  any newly-created resources. Existing resources will not be affected.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2256))\n* Credential stores: Static-type credential stores/credentials now use typed\n  prefixes for any newly-created resources. Existing resources will not be\n  affected. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2256))\n* Change of behavior on `-token` flag in CLI: Passing a token this way can\n  reveal the token to any user or service that can look at process information.\n  This flag must now reference a file on disk or an env var. Direct usage of the\n  `BOUNDARY_TOKEN` env var is also deprecated as it can show up in environment\n  information; the `env://` format now supported by the `-token` flag causes the\n  Boundary process to read it instead of the shell so is safer.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2327))\n* Change of behavior on `-password` flag in CLI: The same change made above for\n  `-token` has also been applied to `-password` or, for supporting resource\n  types, `-current-password` and `-new-password`.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2327))\n\n## 0.9.1 (2022/07/06)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* `azure` host plugin: Support multiple MSI identities\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-kms-wrapping/pull/97))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* scheduler: Fix regression causing controller names of less than 10 characters\n  to fail to register jobs\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2226)).\n* sessions: Fix an additional case from the changes in the 0.8.x series that\n  could result in sessions never moving from `canceling` state to terminated.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2229))\n* The plugin execution_dir configuration parameter is now respected by kms plugins too\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2239)).\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* sessions: The default connect limit for new sessions changed from 1 to unlimited (-1).\n  Specific connection limits is an advanced feature of Boundary and this setting is\n  more friendly for new users.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2234))\n\n## 0.9.0 (2022/06/20)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* If a controller's defined name in a configuration file is less than 10\n  characters, errors may be seen on startup related to registration of jobs.\n  This is a regression in this version and will be fixed in the next release.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* PKI Workers: This release introduces a new worker type `pki` which\n  authenticates to Boundary using a new certificate-based method, allowing for\n  worker deployment without using a shared KMS.\n* Credentials: This release introduces a new credential store type `static`,\n  which simply takes in a user-supplied credential and stores it (encrypted)\n  directly in Boundary. Currently, the `static` credential store can hold\n  credentials of type `username_password`. These credentials can act as\n  credential sources for targets, similar to credential libraries from the\n  `vault` credential store, and thus can be brokered to users at session\n  authorization time. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2174))\n* `boundary connect` Credential Brokering Integration: we have extended integration\n  into the `boundary connect` helpers. A new `sshpass` style has been added to the\n  `ssh` helper, when used, if the credential contains a username/password and `sshpass`\n  is installed, the command will automatically pass the credentials to the `ssh` process.\n  Additionally, the default `ssh` helper will now use the `username` of the brokered credential.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2191)).\n* controller: Improve response time for listing sessions.\n  This also creates a new periodic job that will delete terminated\n  sessions after 1 hour.\n  See Deprecations/Changes for some additional details.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2160)).\n* event filtering: Change event filters to use lowercase and snake case for data\n  elements like the rest of Boundary filters do.\n* ui: Use include_terminated flag for listing sessions.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1126)).\n* ui: Add Quick Setup onboarding guide.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1140)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* The plugin execution_dir configuration parameter is now respected.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2183)).\n* ui: Fix Users page not updating fields correctly.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui/pull/1105)).\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* Targets: Removes support for `credential libraries` with respect to Target resources.\n  The `library` `fields` and `actions` were deprecated in [Boundary 0.5.0](#050-20210802),\n  please use `credential sources` instead. See changelog referenced above for\n  more details ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1533)).\n* Credential Libraries: The `user_password` credential type has been renamed to\n  `username_password` to remove any inconsistency over what the credential type is.\n  All existing `user_password` typed credential libraries will be migrated to\n  `username_password` ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2154)).\n* controller: Change the default behavior of the session list endpoint\n  to no longer include sessions in a terminated state and introduces\n  a new query parameter/cli flag to include the terminated sessions.\n  This also removes the connection information from the list response.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/2160)).\n* Anonymous user permissions: In order to reduce the risk of accidental and\n  unintended granting of permissions to anonymous users, the permissions system\n  now only allows certain actions on certain resources to be assigned to the\n  anonymous user; currently these are the same permissions as assigned in\n  Boundary's default role permissions. If other use-cases arise this list can be\n  expanded.

Note\n  that these are not affecting the resources themselves, only the fields on\n  Target resources that map them to targets:\n* * _Credential Libraries_: In Target definitions, the field referring to\n    attached credential libraries is being renamed to the more abstract\n    _credential sources_. In the future Boundary will gain the ability to\n    internally store static credentials that are not generated or fetched\n    dynamically, and the _sources_ terminology better reflects that the IDs\n    provided are a source of credentials, whether via dynamic generation or via\n    the credentials themselves. This will allow a paradigm similar to\n    `principals` with roles, where the principal IDs can be a users, groups, and\n    managed groups, rather than having them split out, and should result in an\n    easier user experience once those features roll out compared to having\n    separate flags and fields. In this 0.5 release the Boundary CLI has gained\n    parallel `application-credential-source` flags to the existing\n    `application-credential-library` flags, as well as `boundary targets\n    add/remove/set-credential-sources` commands that parallel `boundary targets\n    add/remove/set-credential-libraries` commands. This parallelism extends to\n    the API actions and the grants system. In 0.6, the _library_ versions of\n    these commands, flags, and actions will be removed.\n* * _Host Sets_: Similarly, in Target definitions, the field referring to\n    attached host sets is being renamed to the more abstract _host sources_. In\n    the future Boundary will allow attaching some host types directly, and\n    possibly other mechanisms for gathering hosts for targets, so the _sources_\n    terminology better reflects that the IDs provided are a source of hosts,\n    whether via sets or via the hosts themselves. Like with credential sources,\n    in this 0.5 release the Boundary CLI and API have gained parallel API\n    actions and fields, and the _set_ versions of these will be removed in 0.6.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* OIDC Accounts: When performing a `read` on an `oidc` type account, the\n  original token and userinfo claims are provided in the output. This can make\n  it significantly easier to write filters to create [managed\n  groups](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/filtering/oidc-managed-groups).\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1419))\n* Controllers will now mark connections as closed in the database if the worker\n  has not reported its status; this can be seen as the controller counterpart to\n  the worker-side session cleanup functionality released in 0.4.0. As with the\n  worker, the timeout for this behavior is 15s.\n* Workers will shut down connections gracefully upon shutdown of the worker,\n  both closing the connection and sending a request to mark the connection as\n  closed in the database.\n* Pressing CTRL-C (or sending a SIGINT) when Boundary is already shutting\n  down due to a CTRL-C or interrupt will now cause Boundary to immediately shut\n  down non-gracefully. This may leave various parts of the Boundary deployment\n  (namely sessions or connections) in an inconsistent state.\n\n* Events: Boundary has moved from writing hclog entries to emitting events.\n  There are four types of Boundary events: `error`, `system`, `observation` and\n  `audit`. All events are emitted as\n  [cloudevents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/spec.md) and we\n  support both a `cloudevents-json` format and custom Boundary\n  `cloudevents-text` format.\n\n  **Notes**:\n  * There are still a few lingering hclog bits within Boundary. If you wish to\n    only output json from Boundary logging/events then you should specify both\n    `\"-log-format json\"` and `\"-event-format cloudevents-json\"` when starting\n    Boundary.\n  * Filtering events: hclog log levels have been replaced by optional sets\n    of allow and deny event\n    [filters](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/filtering) which are\n    specified via configuration, or in the case of \"boundary dev\" there are new\n    new cmd flags.\n  * Observation events are MVP and contain a minimal set of observations about a\n    request. Observations are aggregated for each request, so only one\n    observation event will be emitted per request. We anticipate that a rich set\n    of aggregate data about each request will be developed over time.\n  * Audit events are a WIP and will only be emitted if they are both enabled\n    and the env var `BOUNDARY_DEVELOPER_ENABLE_EVENTS` equals true.  We\n    anticipate many changes for audit events before they are generally available\n    including what data is included and different options for\n    redacting/encrypting that data.\n\n\n  PRs:\n    [hclog json,text formats](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1440),\n    [log adapters](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1434),\n    [unneeded log deps](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1433),\n    [update eventlogger](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1411),\n    [convert from hclog to events](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1409),\n    [event filtering](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1404),\n    [cloudevents node](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1390),\n    [system events](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1360),\n    [convert errors to events](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1358),\n    [integrate events into servers](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1355),\n    [event pkg name](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1284),\n    [events using ctx](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1277),\n    [add eventer](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1276),\n    [and base event types](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1275)\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* config: Fix error when populating all `kms` purposes in separate blocks (as\n  well as the error message)\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/1305),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1384))\n* server: Fix panic on worker startup failure when the server was not also\n  configured as a controller\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1432))\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* docker: Add support for muti-arch docker images (amd64/arm64) via Docker buildx\n\n## 0.4.0 (2021/06/29)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Credential Stores: This release introduces Credential Stores, with the first\n  implementation targeting Vault. A credential store can be created that accepts\n  a Vault periodic token (which it will keep refreshed) and connection\n  information allowing it to make requests to Vault.\n* Credential Libraries: This release introduces Credential Libraries, with the\n  first implementation targeting Vault. Credential libraries describe how to\n  make a request to fetch a credential from the credential store. The first\n  credential library is the `generic` type that takes in a user-defined request\n  body to send to Vault and thus can work for any type of Vault secrets engine.\n  When a credential library is used to fetch a credential, if the credential\n  contains a lease, Boundary will keep the credential refreshed, and revoke the\n  credential when the session that requested it is finished.\n* Credential Brokering: Credential libraries can be attached to targets; when a\n  session is authorized against that target, a credential will be fetched from\n  the library that is then relayed to the client. The client can then use this\n  information to make a connection, allowing them to gain the benefit of dynamic\n  credential generation from Vault, but without needing their own Vault\n  login/token (see NOTE below).\n* `boundary connect` Credential Brokering Integration: Additionally, we have\n  started integration into the `boundary connect` helpers, starting in this\n  release with the Postgres helper; if the credential contains a\n  username/password and `boundary connect postgres` is the helper being used,\n  the command will automatically pass the credentials to the `psql` process.\n* The worker will now close any existing proxy connections it is handling when\n  it cannot make a status request to the controller. The timeout for this\n  behavior is currently 15 seconds.\n\nNOTE: When using credential brokering, remember that if the user can connect\ndirectly to the end resource, they can use the brokered username and password\nvia that direct connection to skip Boundary. This isn't any different from\nnormal Boundary behavior (if a user can directly connect, they can bypass\nBoundary) but it's worth repeating.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* scheduler: removes a Postgres check constraint, on the length of the controller name,\n  causing an error when the scheduler attempts to run jobs\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/1309),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1310)).\n* Docker: update entrypoint script to handle more Boundary subcommands for\n  better UX\n\n## 0.3.0 (2021/06/08)\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* `password` account IDs: When the `oidc` auth method came out, accounts were\n  given the prefix `acctoidc`. Unfortunately, accounts in the `password` method\n  were using `apw`...oops. We're standardizing on `acct` and have updated the\n  `password` method to generate new IDs with `acctpw` prefixes.\n  Previously-generated prefixes will continue to work.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* oidc: The new Managed Groups feature allows groups of accounts to be created\n  based on an authenticating user's JWT or User Info data. This data uses the\n  same filtering syntax found elsewhere in Boundary to provide a rich way to\n  specify the criteria for group membership. Once defined, authenticated users\n  are added to or removed from these groups as appropriateds each time they\n  authenticate. These groups are treated like other role principals and can be\n  added to roles to provide grants to users.\n* dev: Predictable IDs in `boundary dev` mode now extend to the accounts created\n  in the default `password` and `oidc` auth methods.\n* mlock: Add a Docker entrypoint script and modify Dockerfiles to handle mlock\n  in a fashion similar to Vault\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1269))\n\n## 0.2.3 (2021/05/21)\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* The behavior when `cors_enabled` is not specified for a listener is changing\n  to be equivalent to a `cors_allowed_origins` value of `*`; that is, accept all\n  origins. This allows Boundary, by default, to have the admin UI and desktop\n  client work without further specification of origins by the operator. This is\n  only affecting default behavior; if `cors_enabled` is explicitly set to\n  `true`, the behavior will be the same as before. This had been changed in\n  v0.2.1 due to a bug found in v0.2.0 that caused all origins to always be\n  allowed, but fixing that bug exposed that the default behavior was difficult\n  for users to configure to simply get up and running.\n* If a `cancel` operation is run on a session already in a canceling or\n  terminated state, a `200` and the session information will be returned instead\n  of an error.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* sessions: Return a `200` and session information when canceling an\n  already-canceled or terminated session\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1243))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* cors: Change the default allowed origins when `cors_enabled` is not specified\n  to be `*`. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1249))\n\n## 0.2.2 (2021/05/17)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* Inline OIDC authentication flow:  when the OIDC authentication flow succeeds,\n  the third-party provider browser window is automatically closed and the user\n  is returned to the admin UI.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* oidc: If provider returns an `aud` claim as a `string` or `[]string`,\n  Boundary will properly parse the claims JSON.\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/cap/issues/37),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1231))\n* sessions: Clean up connections that are dangling after a worker dies (is\n  restarted, powered off, etc.) This fixes some cases where a session never goes\n  to `terminated` state because connections are not properly marked closed.\n  ([Issue 1](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/894), [Issue\n  2](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/1055),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1220))\n* sessions: Add some missing API-level checks when session cancellation was\n  requested. It's much easier than interpreting the domain-level check failures.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1223))\n* authenticate: When authenticating with OIDC and `json` format output, the\n  command will no longer print out a notice that it's opening your web browser\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/1193),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1213))\n\n## 0.2.1 (2021/05/05)\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* API `delete` actions now result in a `204` status code and no body when\n  successful. This was not the case previously due to a technical limitation\n  which has now been solved.\n* When using a `delete` command within the CLI we now either show success or\n  treat the `404` error the same as any other `404` error, that is, it results\n  in a non-zero status code and an error message. This makes `delete` actions\n  behave the same as other commands, all of which pass through errors to the\n  CLI. Given `-format json` capability, it's relatively easy to perform a check\n  to see whether an error was `404` or something else from within scripts, in\n  conjunction with checking that the returned status code matches the API error\n  status code (`1`).\n* When outputting from the CLI in JSON format, the resource information under\n  `item` or `items` (depending on the action) now exactly matches the JSON sent\n  across the wire by the controller, as opposed to matching the Go SDK\n  representation which could result in some extra fields being shown or fields\n  having Go-specific types. This includes `delete` actions which previously\n  would show an object indicating existence, but now show no `item` on success\n  or the API's `404` error.\n* Permissions in new scope default roles have been updated to include support\n  for `list`, `read:self`, and `delete:self` on `auth-token` resources. This\n  allows a user to list and manage their own authentication tokens. (As is the\n  case with other resources, `list` will still be limited to returning tokens on\n  which the user has authorization to perform actions, so granting this\n  capability does not automatically give user the ability to list other users'\n  authentication tokens.)\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* permissions: Improving upon the work put into 0.2.0 to limit the fields that\n  are returned when listing as the anonymous user, grants now support a new\n  `output_fields` section. This takes in a comma-delimited (or in JSON format,\n  array) set of values that correspond to the JSON fields returned from an API\n  call (for listing, this will be applied to each resource under the `items`\n  field). If specified for a given ID or resource type (and scoped to specific\n  actions, if included), only the given values will be returned in the output.\n  If no `output_fields` are specified, the defaults are used. For authenticated\n  users this defaults to all fields; for `u_anon` this defaults to the fields\n  useful for navigating to and authenticating to the system. In either case,\n  this is overridable. See the [permissions\n  documentation](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/security/permissions)\n  for more information on why and when to use this. This currently only applies\n  to top-level fields in the response.\n* cli/api/sdk: Add support to request additional OIDC claims scope values from\n  the OIDC provider when making an authentication request.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1175)).\n\n  By default, Boundary only requests the \"openid\" claims scope value. Many\n  providers, like Okta and Auth0 for example, will not return the standard claims\n  of email and name when you request the default claims scope (openid).\n\n  Boundary uses the standard email and name claims to populate an OIDC\n  account's `Email` and `FullName` attributes. If you'd like these account\n  attributes populated, you'll need to reference your OIDC provider's documentation\n  to learn which claims scopes are required to have these claims returned during\n  the authentication process.\n\n  Boundary now provides a new OIDC auth method parameter `claims_scopes` which\n  allows you to add multiple additional claims scope values to an OIDC auth\n  method configuration.\n\n  For information on claims scope values see: [Scope Claims in the OIDC\n  specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims)\n\n* cli: Match JSON format output with the across-the-wire API JSON format\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1155))\n* api: Return `204` instead of an empty object on successful `delete` operations\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1155))\n* actions: The new `no-op` action allows a grant to be given to a principals\n  without conveying any actionable result. Since resources do not appear in list\n  results if the principal has no actions granted on that resource, this can be\n  used to allow principals to see values in list results without also giving\n  `read` or other capabilities on the resources. The default scope permissions\n  have been updated to convey `no-op,list` instead of `read,list`.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1138))\n* cli/api/sdk: User resources have new attributes for:\n  * Primary Account ID\n  * Login Name\n  * Full Name\n  * Email\n\n  These new user attributes correspond to attributes from the user's primary\n  auth method account. These attributes will be empty when the user has no\n  account in the primary auth method for their scope, or there is no designated\n  primary auth method for their scope.\n* cli: Support for reading and deleting the user's own token via the new\n  `read:self` and `delete:self` actions on auth tokens. If no token ID is\n  provided, the stored token's ID will be used (after prompting), or `\"self\"`\n  can be set as the value of the `-id` parameter to trigger this behavior\n  without prompting. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1162))\n* cli: New `logout` command deletes the current token in Boundary and forgets it\n  from the local system credential store, respecting `-token-name`\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1134))\n* config: The `name` field for workers and controllers now supports being set\n  from environment variables or a file on disk\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1181))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* cors: Fix allowing all origins by default\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1134))\n* cli: It is now an error to run `boundary database migrate` on an uninitalized db.\n  Use `boundary database init` instead.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1184))\n* cli: Correctly honor the `-format` flag when running `boundary database init`\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1204))\n\n## 0.2.0 (2021/04/14)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* By default, CORS support will allow all origins. This is due to a bug in how\n  the set of allowed origins was processed, in conjunction with changes to CORS\n  behavior to automatically include the origin of the Desktop Client. This will\n  be fixed in 0.2.1. In the meantime, this can be worked around by either\n  explicitly disabing CORS with `cors_enabled = false` in the `listener` config\n  block with purpose `api`; or setting a `cors_allowed_origins` field to have\n  values other than `serve://boundary` (including values that do not map to any\n  real origin).\n\n### Deprecations/Changes\n\n* The `auth-methods/<id>:authenticate:login` action is deprecated and will be\n  removed in a few releases. (Yes, this was meant to deprecate the\n  `authenticate` action; apologies for going back on this!) To better support\n  future auth methods, and especially the potential for plugins, rather than\n  defining custom actions on the URL path the `authenticate` action will consume\n  both a map of parameters but also a `command` parameter that specifies the\n  type of command. This allows workflows that require multiple steps, such as\n  OIDC, to not require custom subactions. Additionally, the `credentials` map in\n  the `authenticate` action has been renamed `attributes` to better match other\n  types of resources. `credentials` will still work for now but will be removed\n  in a few releases. Finally, in the Go SDK, the `Authenticate` function now\n  requires a `command` value to be passed in.\n* Related to the above change, the output of an API\n  `auth-methods/<id>:authenticate` call will return the given `command` value\n  and a map of attributes that depend on the given command. On the SDK side, the\n  output of the `Authenticate` function returns a map, from which a concrete\n  type can be easily umarshaled (see the updated `authenticate password` command\n  for an example).\n* Anonymous scope/auth method listing: When listing auth methods and scopes\n  without authentication (that is, as the anonymous user `u_anon`), only\n  information necessary for navigation to an auth method and authenticating to\n  the auth method is now output. Granting `u_anon` list access to other resource\n  types will not currently filter any information out.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* cli/api/sdk: New OIDC auth method type added with support for create, read,\n  update, delete, and list (see new cli `oidc` subcommands available on CRUDL\n  operations for examples), as well as the ability to authenticate against it\n  via the SDK, CLI, admin UI, and desktop client.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1090))\n* server: When performing recursive listing, `list` action is no longer required\n  to be granted to the calling user. Instead, the given scope acts as the root\n  point (so only results under that scope will be shown), and `list` grant is\n  evaluated per-scope. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1016))\n* database init: If the database is already initialized, return 0 as the exit\n  code. This matches how the `database migrate` command works.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1033))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* server: Roles for auto generated scopes are now generated at database init.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/996))\n* cli: Don't panic on certain commands when outputting in `json` format\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/992),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/1095))\n\n## 0.1.8 (2021/03/10)\n\n### Known Issues\n\nThese are specific known issues in the release that we feel are impactful enough\nto call out in this changelog. The full set of open issues is on GitHub.\n\n* cli: When authenticating, changing a password, or a couple of other specific\n  actions on the CLI, if the output format is specified as `json`, the command\n  will panic (after the API call executes). This is due to a preexisting bug\n  that was exposed by the JSON changes described in the changes section below.\n  Although most of our CLI-level tests operate on `json`-format output, because\n  our CLI-level tests use the token helper during execution, the authentication\n  test was using the normal table output since the output was ignored anyways.\n  As a result, our CLI tests did not catch this panic. Our apologies, and we\n  will fix this in the next release.\n* Initially Created Scopes: Starting in 0.1.6, When initial scopes are created\n  when executing `boundary database init`, the associated admin roles aren't\n  created. The intended behavior is to have a role which granted the auto\n  created admin the grant `\"id=*;type=*;actions=*\"` for each auto generated\n  scope.  To set your data to the intended state you can add a role for the\n  admin user in the generated scopes.  An outline of the steps to do this can\n  be found in this\n  [gist](https://gist.github.com/talanknight/98492dc68d894f67742086eb41fdb506).\n  This will be fixed in the next release.\n\n### Changes/Deprecations\n\n* sdk (Go API library): A few functions have changed places. Notably, instead of\n  `ResponseMap()` and `ResponseBody()`, resources simply expose `Response()`.\n  This higher-level response object contains the map and body, and also exposes\n  `StatusCode()` in place of indivdidual resources.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/962))\n* cli: In `json` output format, a resource item is now an object under the\n  top-level key `item`; a list of resource items is now an list of objects under\n  the top-level key `items`. This preserves the top level for putting in other\n  useful information later on (and the HTTP status code is included now).\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/962))\n* cli: In `json` output format, errors are now serialized as a JSON object with\n  an `error` key instead of outputting normal text\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/962))\n* cli: All errors, including API errors, are now written to `stderr`. Previously\n  in the default table format, API errors would be written to `stdout`.\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/962))\n* cli: Error return codes have been standardized across CLI commands. An error\n  code of `1` indicates an error generated from the actual controller API; an\n  error code of `2` is an error encountered due to the CLI command's logic; and\n  an error code of `3` indicates an error that was caused due to user input to\n  the command. (There is some nuance sometimes whether an error is really due to\n  user input or not, but we attempt to be consistent.)\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/976))\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* list filtering: Listing now supports filtering results before being returned\n  to the user. The filtering takes place server side and uses boolean\n  expressions against the JSON representation of returned items. See [the\n  documentation](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/filtering/resource-listing)\n  for more details. ([PR 1](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/952))\n  ([PR 2](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/957))\n  ([PR 3](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/967))\n* server: Officially support reloading TLS parameters on `SIGHUP`. (This likely\n  worked before but wasn't fully tested.)\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/959))\n* server: On `SIGHUP`, [worker\n  tags](https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/configuration/worker#tags) will be\n  re-parsed and new values used\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/959))\n* server: In addition to the existing `tls_min_version` listener configuration\n  value, `tls_max_version` is now supported. This should generally be left blank\n  but can be useful for situations where e.g. a load balancer has broken TLS 1.3\n  support, or does not support TLS 1.3 and flags it as a disallowed value.\n\n## 0.1.7 (2021/02/16)\n\n*Note:* This release fixes an upgrade issue affecting users on Postgres 11\nupgrading to 0.1.5 or 0.1.6 and makes a modification to the `boundary dev`\nenvironment. It is otherwise identical to 0.1.6; see the entry for that version\nfor more details.\n\n### Changes/Deprecations\n\n* `boundary dev` now uses Postgres 11 by default, rather than Postgres 12.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* server: Fix an issue with migrations affecting Postgres 11\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/940))\n\n## 0.1.6 (2021/02/12)\n\n### Changes/Deprecations\n\n* authentication: The `auth-methods/<id>:authenticate` action is deprecated and\n  will be removed in a few releases. Instead, each auth method will define its\n  own action or actions that are valid. This is necessary to support multi-step\n  authentication schemes in upcoming releases. For the `password` auth method,\n  the new action is `auth-methods/<id>:authenticate:login`.\n* permissions: Update some errors to make them more descriptive, and disallow\n  permissions in some forms where they will never take effect, preventing\n  possible confusion (existing grants already saved to the database will not be\n  affected as this is only filtered when grants are added/set on a role):\n  * `id=<some_id>;actions=<some_actions>` where one of the actions is `create`\n    or `list`. By definition this format operates only on individual resources\n    so `create` and `list` will never work\n  * `type=<some_type>;actions=<some_actions>` where one of the actions is _not_\n    `create` or `list`. This format operates only on collections so assigning\n    more actions this way will never work\n* CORS: CORS is now turned on by default when running with `boundary server`\n  with a `cors_allowed_origins` value of `serve://boundary`. You can disable it\n  with `cors_enabled = false`, or if you want to change parameters, set\n  `cors_enabled = true` and the other related configuration values.\n\n### New and Improved\n\n* server: When running single-server mode and `controllers` is not specified in\n  the `worker` block, use `public_cluster_addr` if given\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/904))\n* server: `public_cluster_addr` in the `controller` block can now be specified\n  as a `file://` or `env://` URL to read the value from a file or env var\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/907))\n* server: Add `read` action to default scope grant\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/913))\n* server: `public_cluster_addr` in the `controller` block can now be specified\n  as a `file://` or `env://` URL to read the value from a file or env var\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/907))\n* sessions: Add `read:self` and `cancel:self` actions and enable them by default\n  (in new project scopes) for all sessions. This allows a user to read or cancel\n  any session that is associated with their user ID. `read` and `cancel` actions\n  are still available that allow performing these actions on sessions that are\n  associated with other users.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* api: Fix nil pointer panic that could occur when using TLS\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/902),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/901))\n* server: When shutting down a controller release the shared advisory lock with\n  a non-canceled context.\n  ([Issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/909),\n  [PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/918))\n* targets: If a worker filter references a key that doesn't exist, treat it as a\n  non-match rather than an error\n  ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/900))\n\n## 0.1.5 (2021/01/29)\n\n*NOTE*: This version requires a database migration via the new `boundary\ndatabase migrate` command.\n\n### Security\n\n* Boundary now uses Go's new execabs package for execution of binaries in\n  `boundary connect`. This is for defense-in-depth rather than a specific\n  issue. See the [Go blog post](https://blog.golang.org/path-security) for more\n  details. ([PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/pull/873))\n\n### Changes/Deprecations\n\n* controller/worker: Require names to be all lowercase. This removes ambiguity\n  or accidental mismatching when using upcoming filtering features.\n* api/cli: Due to visibility changes on collection listing, a list will not\n  include any resources if the user only has `list` as an authorized action.

Here you can find common questions around reporting issues and opening\npull requests to our project.\n\nWhen contributing in any way to the Boundary project (new issue, PR, etc), please be aware that our team identifies with many gender pronouns. Please remember to use nonbinary pronouns (they/them) and gender neutral language (\"Hello folks\") when addressing our team. For more reading on our code of conduct, please see the [HashiCorp community guidelines](https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines). \n\n## Issue Reporting\n### Reporting Security Related Vulnerabilities\n\nWe take Boundary's security and our users' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue \nin Boundary, please responsibly disclose by contacting us at security@hashicorp.com. Do not open an issue on \nour GitHub issue tracker if you believe you've found a security related issue, thank you!\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\nIf you believe you found a bug with Boundary, please:\n\n1. Build from the latest `main` HEAD commit to attempt to reproduce the issue. It's possible we've already fixed\nthe bug, and this is a first good step to ensuring that's not the case.\n1. Take a look at the [Boundary Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/boundary/50) to see if other folks have had\nsimilar issues.\n1. Ensure a similar ticket is not already opened by searching our opened issues on GitHub.\n\n\nOnce you've verified the above, feel free to open a bug fix issue template type from our [issue selector](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/new/choose)\nand we'll do our best to triage it as quickly as possible. \n\n## Pull Requests\n\n### New Features & Improvements\n\nBefore writing a line of code, please ask us about a potential improvement or feature that you want to write into Boundary. We may already be working on it; even if we aren't, we need to ensure that both the feature and its proposed implementation is aligned with our road map, vision, and standards for the project. We're happy to help walk through that via a [feature request issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/new/choose).\n\nYou can see a public [road map for Boundary](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/issues/new/choose) on our docs site and we encourage\neveryone to look this over to understand at a high level what we're working on with Boundary.\n\n### Submitting a New Pull Request\n\nWhen submitting a pull request, please ensure:\n\n1. You've added a changelog line clearly describing the new addition under the correct changelog sub-section.\n1. You've followed the above guidelines for contributing to Boundary.\n\nOnce you open your PR, our auto-labeling will add labels to help us triage and prioritize your contribution. Please\nallow us a couple of days to comment, request changes, or approve your PR. Thank you for your contribution!\n\n## Changelog\n\nThe changelog is updated by PR contributors. Each contribution to Boundary should include a changelog update at the contributor or reviewer discretion. \nThe changelog should be updated when the contribution is large enough to warrant it being called out in the larger release cycle. Enhancements, bug fixes,\nand other contributions that practitioners might want to be aware of should exist in the changelog. \n\nWhen contributing to the changelog, follow existing patterns for referencing PR's, issues or other ancillary context.\n\nThe changelog is broken down into sections:\n\n### vNext\n\nThe current release cycle. New contributions slated for the next release should go under this heading. If the contribution is being backported,\nthe inclusion of the feature in the appropriate release during the backport process is handled on an as-needed basis. \n\n### New and Improved\n\nAny enhancements, new features, etc fall into this section. \n\n### Bug Fixes\n\nAny bug fixes fall into this section.\n\n## Testing\n\nMost tests require a postgres database instance to successfully run.\nThis is provided via docker\nby running a customized postgres image that is optimized for boundary tests.\n\nBefore running the test suite, this docker container must be started:\n\n```\n$ make test-database-up\n```\n\nThis can take a few seconds to initialize as it will\ncreate a template database with the boundary migrations.\nThe progress can be checked b running:\n\n```\n$ docker logs -f boundary-sql-tests\n```\n\nOnce a log line like the following is seen, the container is ready for running\ntests:\n\n```\nPostgreSQL init process complete; ready for start up.\n```\n\nAlternatively if the `pg_isready` command is installed, it can be used to\ndetermine if the container is ready, i.e.:\n\n```\n$ until pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1; do sleep 1; done\n```\n\nTo run the entire test suite run this command in the root of the project\nonce the test database is ready:\n\n```\n$ make test\n```\n\nBefore running any test please ensure that Docker is started. Boundary uses a Docker container to initiate a database for testing.\nIf a test is interrupted check to make certain that all Docker containers have been properly destroyed. \n\n### Running individual tests\n\nIf you don't want to run the entire test suite, you can just run a single test\nwith go. For example, if you wanted to run the tests TestAuthTokenAuthenticator, you would\nrun:\n\n```\n$ go test -run TestAuthTokenAuthenticator -v ./internal/auth\n```\n\n### Stopping the test database container\n\nThe test database container can be shutdown using:\n\n```\n$ make test-database-down\n```\n\nNote that the container does *not* need to be shutdown between each run of\n`make test` or `go test`.\n\n### Test database container options\n\nBy default the container uses the host port of 5432.\nThis can changed using an environment variable:\n\n```\n$ export TEST_DB_PORT=5433\n$ make test-database-up\n$ make test\n```\n\nBy default the container name is `boundary-sql-tests`.\nThis can be changed in the same way as the port:\n\n```\n$ export TEST_CONTAINER_NAME=\"custom-name\"\n$ make test-database-up\n$ docker logs custom-name\n```\n\nThe default docker image is built using the `postgres:12` base image.\nThe image can be changed using a make option to test against other versions:\n\n```\n$ make IMAGE_TAG=docker.io/hashicorpboundary/postgres:12-alpine test-database-up\n$ make IMAGE_TAG=docker.io/hashicorpboundary/postgres:13-alpine test-database-up\n$ make IMAGE_TAG=docker.io/hashicorpboundary/postgres:alpine test-database-up\n```\n\nAdditional options can be passed to postgres to customize and override the\nconfiguration in the config file of the docker image.\nSee the troubleshooting section below for more details.\n\n### Troubleshooting test database container\n\nThe postgres configuration file included in the image\nis optimized to support running the full test suite in parallel in CI.\nAs such, there may be issues starting the container locally,\nespecially in cases where the container has less then 4GB of memory.\n\nThis is likely the case if the output of `docker logs boundary-sql-tests` shows:\n\n```\npg_ctl: could not start server\n```\n\nIn this case adjust the\n[max_connections](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS)\nand/or\n[shared_buffers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS):\n\n```\nmake PG_OPTS=\"-c max_connections=1000\" test-database-up\n```\n\nNote that if `max_connections` is set too low, it may result in sporadic test\nfailures if a connection cannot be established. In this case, reduce the number\nof concurrent tests via `GOMAXPROCS` or selectively run tests.\n\n### SDK and API tests\n\nTests for the SDK and API modules can also be run. These do not require a test\ndatabase:\n\n```\n$ make test-api\n$ make test-sdk\n```\n\nOr all of the test can be run with a single target:\n\n```\n$ make test-all\n```\n\n## Performance\n### Database Indexes\n\nMost of the indexes in the database are for enforcing data constraints.\nWe have not added indexes for improving performance because we do not have a way\nto measure and test these types of indexes.\nWe want a way to test and verify that indexes added to improve performance are actually being used by the system.\nAnd we want these same tests to fail when an index stops being used as we evolve the system.\nThis is on our roadmap but we have not started work on it yet.\n\n## Additional docs\n\n* [Adding fields to the API](internal/adding-a-new-field-readme.md)\n"

In addition, Products that \n                      are not provided on a paid basis are not competitive.\n\n                      \"Product\" means software that is offered to end users to manage \n                      in their own environments or offered as a service on a hosted \n                      basis.\n\n                      \"Embedded\" means including the source code or executable code \n                      from the Licensed Work in a competitive offering. \"Embedded\" \n                      also means packaging the competitive offering in such a way \n                      that the Licensed Work must be accessed or downloaded for the \n                      competitive offering to operate.\n\n                      Hosting or using the Licensed Work(s) for internal purposes \n                      within an organization is not considered a competitive \n                      offering. HashiCorp considers your organization to include all \n                      of your affiliates under common control.\n\n                      For binding interpretive guidance on using HashiCorp products \n                      under the Business Source License, please visit our FAQ. \n                      (https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq)\nChange Date:          Four years from the date the Licensed Work is published.\nChange License:       MPL 2.0\n\nFor information about alternative licensing arrangements for the Licensed Work,\nplease contact licensing@hashicorp.com.\n\nNotice\n\nBusiness Source License 1.1\n\nTerms\n\nThe Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative\nworks, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work.

It can run in clouds, on-prem, secure enclaves and more, and does not require\nan agent to be installed on every end host, making it suitable for access to managed/cloud services and container-based workflows in addition to traditional host systems and services.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.boundaryproject.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F58478%2F1664218843-boundary-illustration-option2-1.png&w=3840&q=75\" alt=\"Watch the video\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\">\n\nFor more information, refer to \"[What is Boundary?](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/overview/what-is-boundary)\" on the Boundary website.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBoundary consists of two server components: \n\n* **Controller**, which serves the API and coordinate session requests\n* **Workers**, which perform session handling\n\nA real-world Boundary installation will likely consist of one or more\ncontrollers paired with one or more workers. A single Boundary binary can act\nin either, or both, of these two modes.\n\nAdditionally, Boundary provides a Desktop client and CLI for end-users to request and establish \nauthorized sessions to resources across a network.\n\n<img src=\"boundary_desktop_example.gif\" alt=\"Boundary Desktop GIF\" width=\"66%\" height=\"66%\" loop=\"true\">\n\nBoundary does _not_ require software to be installed on your hosts and services.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBoundary has two external dependencies: \n- A SQL database\n- At least one KMS\n\n### SQL database\nThe database contains Boundary's configuration and session information. The \ncontroller nodes must be able to access the database. \n\nValues that are secrets (e.g credentials) are encrypted in the database. Currently, PostgreSQL is supported as a database and has been tested with Postgres 12 and above.\n\nBoundary uses only common extensions and both hosted and self-managed instances are supported. In most instances, all that you need is a database endpoint and the appropriate credentials.\n\n### KMS \nBoundary uses KMS keys for various purposes, such as protecting secrets, authenticating workers, recovering data, encrypting values in Boundary’s configuration, and more. Boundary uses key derivation extensively to avoid key sprawl of these high-value keys.\n\nYou can use [any cloud KMS or Vault's Transit Secrets Engine to satisfy the KMS requirement](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/configuration/kms). \n\n## Trying out Boundary\n\nRunning Boundary in a more permanent context requires a few more steps, such\nas writing some simple configuration files to tell the nodes how to reach their\ndatabase and KMS. The steps below, along with the extra information needed\nfor permanent installations, are detailed in our [Installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/install-boundary/install).\n\n> ⚠️  Do _not_ use the `main` branch except for dev or test cases. Boundary 0.10 introduced release branches which should be safe to track, however, migrations in `main` may be renumbered if needed. The Boundary team will not be able to provide assistance if running `main` over the long term results in migration breakages or other bugs.\n\n### Download and Run from Release Page\n\nDownload the latest release of the server binary and appropriate desktop\nclient(s) from our [downloads page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/downloads)\n\n## Quickstart with Boundary Dev\n\nBoundary has a `dev` mode that you can use for testing. In `dev` mode, you can start both a\ncontroller and worker with a single command, and they have the\nfollowing properties:\n\n* The controller starts a PostgreSQL Docker container to use as storage.\n  This container will be shut down and removed, if possible, when the\n  controller is shut down gracefully.\n* The controller uses an internal KMS with ephemeral keys\n\n### Building from Source\nIf you meet the following local requirements, you can quickly get up and running with Boundary:\n- Go v1.21 or greater\n- Docker\n- Either the [Boundary UI dependencies](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-ui#prerequisites)\n  for locally building the ui assets\n  or [gh cli](https://cli.github.com) for downloading pre-built ui assets.\n\nSimply run:\n\n  ```make install```\n\nThis will build Boundary. (The first time this is run it will fetch and compile\nUI assets; which will take a few extra minutes.) Once complete, run Boundary in\n`dev` mode:\n\n  ```$GOPATH/bin/boundary dev```\n\nPlease note that development may require other tools; to install the set of\ntools at the versions used by the Boundary team, run:\n\n  ```make tools```\n\nWithout doing so, you may encounter errors while running `make install`. It is important\nto also note that using `make tools` will install various tools used for Boundary\ndevelopment to the normal Go binary directory; this may overwrite or take precedence\nover tools that might already be installed on the system.\n\n### Start Boundary\n\nStart the server binary with:\n\n  ```boundary dev```\n\nThis will start a Controller service listening on `http://127.0.0.1:9200` for\nincoming API requests and a Worker service listening on `http://127.0.0.1:9202`\nfor incoming session requests. It will also create various default resources and\ndisplay various useful pieces of information, such as a login name and password\nthat can be used to authenticate.\n\n### Configuring Resources\n\nFor a simple test of Boundary in `dev` mode you don't generally need to\nconfigure any resources at all! But it's useful to understand what `dev` mode\ndid for you so you can then take further steps. By default, `dev` mode will\ncreate:\n\n* The `global` Scope for initial authentication, containing a Password-type\n  Auth Method, along with an Account for login.\n* An organization Scope under `global`, and a project Scope inside the\n  organization.\n* A Host Catalog with a default Host Set, which itself contains a Host with the\n  address of the local machine (`127.0.0.1`)\n* A Target mapping the Host Set to a set of connection parameters, with a\n  default port of `22` (e.g. SSH)\n\nYou can go into Boundary's web UI or use its API to change these\ndefault values, for instance if you want to connect to a different host or need\nto modify the port on which to connect.\n\n### Making the Connection\n\nNext, let's actually make a connection to your local SSH daemon via Boundary:\n\n1. Authenticate to Boundary; using default `dev` values, this would be `boundary\n   authenticate password -auth-method-id ampw_1234567890 -login-name admin\n   -password password`. (Note that if you do not include the `password` flag you\n   will be prompted for it.)\n2. Run `boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_1234567890`. If you want to adjust\n   the username, pass `-username <name>` to the command.\n\nCheck out the possibilities for target configuration to test out limiting (or increasing) the\nnumber of connections per session or setting a maximum time limit; try canceling\nan active session from the sessions page or via `boundary sessions`, make your\nown commands with `boundary connect -exec`, and so on.\n\n### Going Further\n\nThis example is a simple way to get started but omits several key steps that\ncould be taken in a production context:\n\n* Using a firewall or other means to restrict the set of hosts allowed to\n  connect to a local service to only Boundary Worker nodes, thereby making\n  Boundary the _only_ means of ingress to a host\n* Using the [Boundary Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest) to easily integrate Boundary with your\n  existing code-based infrastructure\n* Pointing a BI tool (PowerBI, Tableau, etc.) at Boundary's data warehouse to\n  generate insights and look for anomalies with respect to session access\n\n----\n\n**Please note**: We take Boundary's security and our users' trust very\nseriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in Boundary,\n_please responsibly disclose_ by contacting us at\n[security@hashicorp.com](mailto:security@hashicorp.com).\n\n----\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing!

          "content": "# SQL Style Guide\n\nThis guide establishes the standards for SQL in Boundary.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThese guidelines are designed to make our SQL more readable, maintainable, and greppable.\n\n## Rules\n\n### Formatting\n\n- No tabs. 2 spaces per indent.\n- No trailing whitespace.\n- No more than two blank lines between statements.\n- No empty lines in the middle of a single statement.\n- Do not SHOUTCASE or \"Sentence case\" SQL keywords (e.g., use `select`, not `SELECT` or `Select`).\n- Use \"river\" formatting for [DML](#data-manipulation-statements).\n\n### Data Definition Statements\n\nKeep the object of `create`, `alter`, `drop`, and `comment on` statements on the\nsame line as the statement.\n\n### Tables\n\n```sql\ncreate table imaginary_basket (\n  public_id wt_public_id primary key,\n  store_id wt_public_id not null\n    constraint imaginary_store_fkey\n      references imaginary_store (public_id)\n      on delete cascade\n      on update cascade,\n  basket_name text not null\n    constraint basket_name_must_not_be_empty\n      check(\n        length(trim(basket_name)) > 0\n      ),\n  basket_type text not null default 'fruit_basket'\n    constraint basket_type_enm_fkey\n      references basket_type_enm (name)\n      on delete restrict\n      on update cascade,\n  constraint imaginary_basket_store_id_basket_name_uq\n    unique(store_id, basket_name)\n);\ncomment on table imaginary_basket is\n  'imaginary_basket is a table where each row is a resource that represents an imaginary shopping basket.';\n```\n\nFor `create table` statements:\n\n- Keep the `create table` statement and the name of the table on the same line.\n- For columns, keep the column name, column type, `not null` (if applicable),\n  and default value (if applicable) on the same line.\n- Put the `primary key` declaration at the start of the `create table` statement.\n- If the `primary key` is a single column, put the `primary key` declaration on\n  the same line as the column name and column type.\n- Put constraints for a single column on a new line indented under the column declaration.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Name all constraints.\n- Give `check` constraints a name that describes what rule the constraint is enforcing.\n- The naming pattern for foreign key constraints is `reftable_fkey` where\n  `reftable` is the name of the referenced table.\n- The naming pattern for unique constraints is `tablename_col1_colx_uq` where\n  `tablename` is the name of the table and `col1_colx` is the name of each\n  column in the unique constraint.\n- The naming pattern for unique constraint names which would be over 63 characters\n  in length is to prioritize keeping the full `tablename_uq` pattern intact and\n  abbreviate the names of the columns.\n\n### Functions\n\n```sql\ncreate or replace function colorize_basket(basket_id wt_public_id, basket_color text) returns void\nas $$\nbegin\n  ....\nend;\n$$ language plpgsql;\ncomment on function colorize_basket is\n  'colorize_basket is a function ....';\n```\n\nFor `create function` and `create or replace function` statements:\n\n- Keep the `create function` statement, function name, function parameters and `returns` statement on the same line.\n\n### Triggers\n\n```sql\ncreate trigger update_version_column after update of version, termination_reason, key_id, tofu_token, server_id, server_type on session\n  for each row execute procedure update_version_column();\n```\n\nFor `create trigger` statements:\n- Keep the `create trigger` statement, trigger name, `before | after`, event\n  name, and `on table_name` statement on the same line.\n- Put the remaining statements on a new indented line.\n\n### Domains\n\n```sql\ncreate domain wt_private_id as text not null\ncheck(\n  length(trim(value)) > 10\n);\ncomment on domain wt_private_id is\n  'Random ID generated with github.com/hashicorp/go-secure-stdlib/base62';\n```\n\nFor `create domain` statements:\n- Keep the `create domain` statement, domain name, `as data_type`, `not null`\n  (if applicable), and default value (if applicable) on the same line.\n- Put check constraints on new lines.\n\n### `comment on` statements\n\nFor `comment on` statements:\n\n- Keep the `comment on` statement, object type, object name, and `is`\n  statement on the same line.\n- Put `comment on` statements directly below the database object the comment is on.\n- Do not put any blank lines between the `comment on` statement and the database\n  object declaration block that comment is for.\n- Put the text of the `comment on` a new indented line.\n\n### Data Manipulation Statements\n\nData manipulation statements should align SQL keywords in a column to form a\n[river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_(typography))\nbetween the keywords and the rest of the statement.\nThis makes it easier to scan the statement.\nIt can also help identify keywords in cases where syntax\nhighlighting might not be available,\nsuch as when statements are written in go string literals.\n\n```sql\n   select b.public_id,\n          b.basket_name,\n          b.basket_type,\n          s.store_name,\n          s.store_descrption\n     from imaginary_basket as b\nleft join imaginary_store  as s\n       on b.store_id = s.public_id\n    where basket_type = $1;\n```\n\n```sql\nupdate imaginary_basket\n   set basket_name = basket_name || '(' || basket_type || ')'\n where basket_type = $1;\n```\n\n```sql\ndelete\n  from imaginary_basket\n where basket_type = $1;\n```\n\nFor insert statements, align the spacing of the column names and values.\n\n```sql\ninsert into imaginary_basket\n            (public_id,     store_id,      basket_type,    basket_name)\n     values ('b_123456789', 's_123456789', 'fruit_basket', 'my fruit basket'),\n            ('b_234567891', 's_123456789', 'toy_basket',   'my toy basket');\n```\n\nFor more complex queries,\nthere can be multiple rivers,\nlike when a query includes sub-queries,\nor when using a common table expression (CTE):\n\n```sql\nwith baskets as (\n  select public_id\n    from basket\n   where (create_time, public_id) < ($1, $2)\norder by create_time desc,\n         public_id   desc\n   limit 1000\n),\nimaginary_baskets as (\n  select *\n    from imaginary_basket\n   where public_id in (select public_id\n                         from baskets)\n),\nreal_baskets as (\n  select *\n    from real_basket\n   where public_id in (select public_id\n                         from baskets)\n),\nfinal as (\n   select public_id,\n          basket_name,\n          basket_type,\n          'imaginary' as type\n     from imaginary_baskets\n    union\n   select public_id,\n          basket_name,\n          basket_type,\n          'real' as type\n     from real_baskets\n)\n  select *\n    from final\norder by create_time desc,\n         public_id   desc;\n```\n"
