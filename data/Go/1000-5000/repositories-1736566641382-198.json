Simple and easy to use, powerful, with rich plug-in mechanism and high scalability.\n\n> HttpRunner [用户调研问卷][survey] 持续收集中，我们将基于用户反馈动态调整产品特性和需求优先级。\n\n![flow chart](https://httprunner.com/image/hrp-flow.jpg)\n\n[CHANGELOG] | [中文]\n\n## Key Features\n\n### API Testing\n\n- [x] Full support for HTTP(S)/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests.\n- [ ] Support more protocols, WebSocket, TCP, RPC etc.\n- [x] Testcases can be described in multiple formats, `YAML`/`JSON`/`Golang`, and they are interchangeable.\n- [x] Use Charles/Fiddler/Chrome/etc to record HTTP requests and generate testcases from exported [`HAR`][HAR].\n- [x] Supports `variables`/`extract`/`validate`/`hooks` mechanisms to create extremely complex test scenarios.\n- [x] Data driven with `parameterize` mechanism, supporting sequential/random/unique strategies to select data.\n- [ ] Built-in 100+ commonly used functions for ease, including md5sum, max/min, sleep, gen_random_string etc.\n- [x] Create and call custom functions with `plugin` mechanism, support [hashicorp plugin] and [go plugin].\n- [x] Generate html reports with rich test results.\n- [x] Using it as a `CLI tool` or a `library` are both supported.\n\n### Load Testing\n\nBase on the API testing testcases, you can run professional load testing without extra work.\n\n- [x] Inherit all powerful features of [`locust`][locust] and [`boomer`][boomer].\n- [x] Report performance metrics to [prometheus pushgateway][pushgateway].\n- [x] Use `transaction` to define a set of end-user actions that represent the real user activities.\n- [x] Use `rendezvous` points to force Vusers to perform tasks concurrently during test execution.\n- [x] Load testing with specified concurrent users or constant RPS, also supports spawn rate.\n- [ ] Support mixed-scenario testing with custom weight.\n- [ ] Simulate browser's HTTP parallel connections.\n- [ ] IP spoofing.\n- [ ] Run in distributed mode to generate unlimited RPS.\n\n### Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM)\n\nYou can also monitor online services for digital experience assessments.\n\n- [ ] HTTP(S) latency statistics including DNSLookup, TCP connections, SSL handshakes, content transfers, etc.\n- [ ] `ping` indicators including latency, throughput and packets loss.\n- [ ] traceroute\n- [ ] DNS monitoring\n\n## Install\n\nYou can install HttpRunner via one curl command.\n\n```bash\n$ bash -c \"$(curl -ksSL https://httprunner.com/script/install.sh)\"\n```\n\nThen you will get a `hrp` CLI tool.\n\n```text\n$ hrp -h\n\n██╗  ██╗████████╗████████╗██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗   ██╗███╗   ██╗███╗   ██╗███████╗██████╗\n██║  ██║╚══██╔══╝╚══██╔══╝██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██║   ██║████╗  ██║████╗  ██║██╔════╝██╔══██╗\n███████║   ██║      ██║   ██████╔╝██████╔╝██║   ██║██╔██╗ ██║██╔██╗ ██║█████╗  ██████╔╝\n██╔══██║   ██║      ██║   ██╔═══╝ ██╔══██╗██║   ██║██║╚██╗██║██║╚██╗██║██╔══╝  ██╔══██╗\n██║  ██║   ██║      ██║   ██║     ██║  ██║╚██████╔╝██║ ╚████║██║ ╚████║███████╗██║  ██║\n╚═╝  ╚═╝   ╚═╝      ╚═╝   ╚═╝     ╚═╝  ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝  ╚═══╝╚═╝  ╚═══╝╚══════╝╚═╝  ╚═╝\n\nHttpRunner is an open source API testing tool that supports HTTP(S)/HTTP2/WebSocket/RPC\nnetwork protocols, covering API testing, performance testing and digital experience\nmonitoring (DEM) test types.
