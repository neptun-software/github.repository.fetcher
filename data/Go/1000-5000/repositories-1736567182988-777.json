The list of organizations and users who consider themselves as SuperMQ adopters and that **publicly/officially** shared information and/or details of their adoption journey(optional).\nWhere users themselves directly maintain the list.\n\n## Adding yourself as an adopter\nIf you are using SuperMQ, please consider adding yourself as an adopter with a brief description of your use case by opening a pull request to this file and adding a section describing your adoption of SuperMQ technology.\n\n**Please send PRs to add or remove organizations/users**\n\n### Format\n\n```\nN: Name of user (company or individual)\nD: Short Use Case Description (optional)\nL: Link with further information (optional)\nT: Type of adaptation: Evaluation, Core Technology, Production Usage (optional)\n```\n\n## Requirements\n* You must represent the user or organization listed. Do NOT add entries on behalf of other organizations or individuals.\nPull request commit must be [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits) and auto-checked with [ Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/)\n* There is no minimum requirement or adaptation size, but we request to list permanent deployments only, i.e., no demo or trial deployments. Commercial or production use is not required. A well-done home lab setup can be equally impressive as a large-scale commercial deployment.\n\n\n**The list of organizations/users that have publicly shared the usage of SuperMQ:**\n\n**Note**: Several other organizations/users couldn't publicly share their usage details but are active project contributors and SuperMQ Community members.\n\n\n## Adopters list (alphabetical)\n\n\n**Note:** The list is maintained by the users themselves. If you find yourself on this list, and you think it's inappropriate. Please contact [project maintainers](https://github.com/absmach/supermq/blob/main/MAINTAINERS) and you will be permanently removed from the list.\n"

Please report unacceptable behavior to\n[abuse@abstractmachines.fr](mailto:abuse@abstractmachines.fr).\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nReporting issues are a great way to contribute to the project. We are perpetually grateful about a well-written,\nthorough bug report.\n\nBefore raising a new issue, check [our issue\nlist](https://github.com/absmach/supermq/issues) to determine if it already contains the\nproblem that you are facing.\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you for more information. Please be as detailed as possible. The following questions might serve as a template for writing a detailed\nreport:\n\n- What were you trying to achieve?\n- What are the expected results?\n- What are the received results?\n- What are the steps to reproduce the issue?\n- In what environment did you encounter the issue?\n\n## Pull requests\n\nGood pull requests (e.g. patches, improvements, new features) are a fantastic help. They should\nremain focused in scope and avoid unrelated commits.\n\n**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing new features,\nrefactoring code etc.), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the\nmaintainers might not want to merge into the project.\n\nPlease adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project. If in doubt, consult the\n[Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) style guide.\n\nTo contribute to the project, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) it,\nclone your fork repository, and configure the remotes:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/<your-username>/supermq.git\ncd supermq\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/absmach/supermq.git\n```\n\nIf your cloned repository is behind the upstream commits, then get the latest changes from upstream:\n\n```\ngit checkout main\ngit pull --rebase upstream main\n```\n\nCreate a new topic branch from `main` using the naming convention `SMQ-[issue-number]`\nto help us keep track of your contribution scope:\n\n```\ngit checkout -b SMQ-[issue-number]\n```\n\nCommit your changes in logical chunks. When you are ready to commit, make sure\nto write a Good Commit Message™. Consult the [Erlang's contributing guide](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages)\nif you're unsure of what constitutes a Good Commit Message™. Use [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase)\nto group your commits into logical units of work before making it public.\n\nNote that every commit you make must be signed. By signing off your work you indicate that you\nare accepting the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).\n\nUse your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). If you set your `user.name`\nand `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.\n\nLocally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:\n\n```\ngit pull --rebase upstream main\n```\n\nPush your topic branch up to your fork:\n\n```\ngit push origin SMQ-[issue-number]\n```\n\n[Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title\nand detailed description.\n"

It is a planetarily distributed, highly scalable, and secure platform that serves as a robust foundation for building advanced real-time and reactive systems.\n\n## Why SuperMQ Stands Out 🚀\n\nSuperMQ bridges the gap between various network protocols (HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP, and more) to provide a seamless messaging experience. Whether you're working on IoT solutions, real-time data pipelines, or event-driven systems, SuperMQ has you covered. 🌐✨\n\n## Key Features 🌟\n\n- **Multi-Protocol Connectivity**: HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket, CoAP, and more! 🌉\n- **Secure by Design**: Mutual TLS (mTLS) with X.509 Certificates, JWT support, and multi-protocol authorization. 🔒\n- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Support for ABAC and RBAC policies. 📜\n- **Multi-Tenant**: Manage multiple domains seamlessly. 🏢\n- **Multi-User**: Unlimited organizational hierarchies for user management. 👥\n- **Application Management**: Group and share messaging clients for streamlined operations. 📱\n- **Ease of Use**: Simple and powerful communication channel management, grouping, and sharing. ✨\n- **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**: Scoped and revocable tokens for enhanced security. 🔑\n- **Observability**: Integrated logging and instrumentation with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry. 📈\n- **Event Sourcing**: Build robust and scalable architectures. ⚡\n- **Edge and IoT Ready**: Supports MQTT and CoAP protocols for seamless IoT gateway and sensor communication and management. 🌍\n- **Developer-Friendly**: SDKs, CLI tools, and comprehensive documentation to get you started. 👩‍💻👨‍💻\n- **Production-Ready**: Container-based deployment using Docker and Kubernetes. 🐳☸️\n\n## Installation 🛠️\n\nClone the repository and start SuperMQ services:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/absmach/supermq.git\ncd supermq\ndocker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file docker/.env up\n```\n\nOr use the [Makefile](Makefile) for a simpler command:\n\n```bash\nmake run\n```\n\nFor production deployments, check our [Kubernetes guide](https://docs.supermq.abstractmachines.fr/kubernetes). ⚙️\n\n### Usage 📤📥\n\n#### Using the CLI:\n\n```bash\nmake cli\n./build/supermq-cli status\n```\n\nThis command retrieves the status of the SuperMQ server and outputs it to the console.\n\n#### Using HTTP with Curl:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8080/status\n```\n\nThis request fetches the server status over HTTP and provides a JSON response.\n\nSee our [CLI documentation](https://docs.supermq.abstractmachines.fr/cli) for more details.\n\n## Documentation 📚\n\nThe official documentation is hosted at [SuperMQ docs page](https://docs.supermq.abstractmachines.fr).\n\nDocumentation is auto-generated, check out the instructions in the [docs repository](https://github.com/absmach/supermq-docs).\nIf you spot an error or a need for corrections, please let us know - or even better: send us a PR! 💌\n\n## Community and Contributing 🤝\n\nThank you for your interest in SuperMQ and the desire to contribute!\n\n1. Take a look at our [open issues](https://github.com/absmach/supermq/issues).
