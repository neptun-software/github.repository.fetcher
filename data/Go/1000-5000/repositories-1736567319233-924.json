The flag can be set to `rbac` which will configure KIC to verify the token\n  sent with the request.\n  For more information on this migration please consult\n  [kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder#3907][kubebuilder_3907].\n  [#6861](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6861)\n\n[kubebuilder_3907]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/discussions/3907\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Custom Prometheus metrics (e.g. `ingress_controller_configuration_push_count`,\n  `ingress_controller_configuration_push_broken_resource_count`, etc.) were not\n  collected properly when the Konnect integration was enabled (only Konnect-related\n  metrics were collected, omitting regular DP metrics). This has been fixed.\n  [#6881](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6881)\n\n## [3.4.1]\n\n> Release date: 2025-01-03\n\n**NOTE**:\nThis release addresses the security advisory [GHSA-58mg-ww7q-xw3p][sec_advisory_58mg].\n\n## [3.4.0]\n\n> Release date: 2024-12-18\n\n**NOTE**:\nThis release has been affectd by the security advisory [GHSA-58mg-ww7q-xw3p][sec_advisory_58mg].\nThe images for this release have been removed and are no longer available for use.\nPlease use [3.4.1] or later instead.\n\n[sec_advisory_58mg]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/security/advisories/GHSA-58mg-ww7q-xw3p\n\n### Highlights\n\n- 🎂 New LTS version.\n- 🔒 Added Upstream TLS verification, both via `Service` annotations and Gateway\n  API `BackendTLSPolicy`. By using this feature, it is now possible to set up encrypted\n  communication between Kong and the backends.\n- 🎓 `KongCustomEntity` API has been promoted from beta to GA.\n- 🔎 Added `/debug/config/diff-report` diagnostic endpoint. It returns the latest\n  diff information for the controller's last configuration sync along with config\n  hash and sync timestamp metadata. It's only supported with Gateways running in DB mode.\n- 📊 Added the `--secret-label-selector` and `--configmap-label-selector` to\n  limit the number of `Secret`s and `ConfigMap`s ingested by the controller. By\n  setting this flag, the `Secret`s and `ConfigMap`s that are ingested will be limited\n  to those having the flag's value as a label set to \"true\". This can reduce the\n  memory usage in scenarios with a large number of big `Secret`s and `ConfigMap`s.\n\n### Added\n\n- Added Prometheus metrics `ingress_controller_configuration_push_size`\n  and `ingress_controller_fallback_configuration_push_size` to record size of\n  the config sent to a Kong DataPlane by the controller in DB-less mode.\n  [#6664](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6664)\n- Added support for `ControlPlaneRef` in `KongConsumer`, `KongConsumerGroup`,\n  and `KongVault` reconcilers. From now, objects that have `ControlPlaneRef`\n  of type other than `kic` will be ignored by the reconcilers. KIC will still\n  reconcile objects with `ControlPlaneRef` of type `kic` or without an explicit\n  `ControlPlaneRef`.\n  [#6690](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6690)\n- Combine Kong gateway services from rules of `HTTPRoute` sharing the same\n  backends (same combination of group, kind, namespace, name, port and weight)\n  from different `HTTPRoute` in the same namespace.\n  The feature is enabled when feature gate `CombinedServicesFromDifferentHTTPRoutes`\n  is enabled. The feature gate is disabled by default.\n  The name of translated Kong gateway service is changed to\n  `httproute.<namespace>.svc.<backend_ns>.<backend_name>.<backend_port>.[backend_weight]_[next_backends]...`\n  when the feature is enabled, like:\n  `httproute.default.svc.default.svc1.80.90_default.svc2.80.10`.\n  If the calculated service name is longer than 511 characters\n  (maximum allowed by Kong or Konnect), the name will be trimmed to the format\n  with only the first backend reserved in the name:\n  `httproute.<namespace>.svc.<backend_ns>.<backend_name>.<backend_port>.[backend_weight]_combined.<hash>`\n  where `<hash>` is the hash result of the calculated name, like\n  `httproute.default.svc.default.a-long-long-long-service-name.80_combined.00001111222233334444aaaabbbbcccc`.\n  [#6711](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6711)\n  [#6766](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6766)\n- The new tag `k8s-named-route-rule` is added to a Kong Route, in the case when\n  mapped `HTTPRoute`, `GRPCRoute`, `TCPRoute`, `TLSRoute` or `UDPRoute` has one\n  or many route rules named (filled `spec.rules[*].name` field), those names will\n  be propagated to one or many instances of aforementioned tag.\n  [#6759](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6759)\n  [#6780](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6780)\n- Added `/debug/config/diff-report` diagnostic endpoint. This endpoint is\n  available in DB mode when the `--dump-config` and `--dump-sensitive-config`\n  are enabled. It returns the latest diff information for the controller's last\n  configuration sync along with config hash and sync timestamp metadata. The\n  controller maintains the last 5 diffs in cache. You can retrieve older diffs\n  by appending a `?hash=<hash>` query string argument. Available config hashes\n  and their timestamps are listed under the `available` section of the\n  response.\n  [#6131](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6131)\n- Added schema validation for `KongCustomEntity`. Kubernetes event will be created\n  for each validation error for `KongCustomEntity` objects.\n  [#6802](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6802)\n- Added support for upstream TLS verification with new Kubernetes `Service`\n  annotations:\n  - `konghq.com/tls-verify`: set to `true` to enable TLS verification for\n    upstream connections of a `Service`.\n  - `konghq.com/tls-verify-depth`: set to an integer to specify the maximum\n    depth of the certificate chain that will be verified.\n  - `konghq.com/ca-certificates-secrets`: set to a comma-delimited list of CA\n    certificate Secrets' names to use for verification.\n  - `konghq.com/ca-certificates-configmaps`: set to a comma-delimited list of CA\n    certificate ConfigMaps' names to use for verification.\n  [#6707](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6707)\n- Added Support for upstream TLS verification with the Gateway API `BackendTLSPolicy`\n  API. The user can reference any Kubernetes `Service` in the `BackendTLSPolicy`\n  spec, and in case the service is used as a backend by `HTTPRoute`s that reference\n  a Kong Gateway as parent, such Backend TLS configuration is applied to the service\n  section of the Kong configuration. The `BackendTLSPolicies` CA Certificates can\n  be set in `Secret`s or `ConfigMap`s.\n  [#6712](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6712)\n  [#6753](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6753)\n  [#6837](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6837)\n  [#6853](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6853)\n- Added the flag `--secret-label-selector` to set the label selector for `Secrets`\n  to ingest. By setting this flag, the secrets that are ingested will be limited\n  to those having the flag's value as a label set to \"true\". This can reduce the\n  memory usage in scenarios with a large number of giant secrets.\n  [#6795](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6795)\n- Added the flag `--configmap-label-selector` to set the label selector for `ConfigMap`s\n  to ingest. By setting this flag, the `ConfigMap`s that are ingested will be limited\n  to those having the flag's value as a label set to \"true\". This limits the amount\n  of resources that are kept in memory. The default value is `konghq.com/configmap`.\n  [#6753](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6753)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Bump version of Gateway API to `1.2.0`.\n  [#6571](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6571)\n- Set SNI's certificate ID ref in the generated config.\n  [#6660](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6660)\n- Improved robustness of extracting comma-delimited annotations by trimming whitespace\n  in every value and discarding empty values. Affects following annotations:\n  - `konghq.com/protocols`\n  - `konghq.com/methods`\n  - `konghq.com/snis`\n  - `konghq.com/host-aliases`\n  - `konghq.com/publish-service`\n  - `konghq.com/tags`\n  [#6729](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6729)\n- Log `Object requested backendRef to target, but it does not exist, skipping...`\n  as `DEBUG` instead of `ERROR`, enhance `HTTPRoute` status with detailed message.\n  [#6746](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6746)\n- Logs related to misconfiguration of objects like `object failed to apply...`\n  and `resource processing failed` are logged as `DEBUG` instead of `ERROR`,\n  any needed information is reported in the status of the affected object or\n  with Kubernetes events.\n  [#6790](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6790)\n- Do not log `ERROR` when referenced `KongPlugin` or `KongClusterPlugin` does not exist\n  or there is no grant that allows referencing it, instead generate a Kubernetes Event\n  `KongConfigurationTranslationFailed` for object that references it.\n  [#6814](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6814)\n  [#6841](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6841)\n- From now on, upstreams produced by KIC from `Service`s that are configured as\n  upstream services (either by `ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream` annotation\n  or through `IngressClassNamespacedParameters`'s `serviceUpstream` field), will use\n  a FQDN with a default cluster domain of `\"\"`.\n  Users can override the default by setting the `--cluster-domain` flag.\n  [#6697](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6697)\n- Translate `RequestRedirect` HTTPRoute filter to `redirect` plugin if supported\n  by Kong gateway (versions >= 3.9.0).\n  This satisfies the Gateway API specification of preserving paths in redirect\n  response from the request.\n  The target port of redirect is set to empty when the `port` of the filter is\n  not given for remaining the port in the request for the conformance with\n  gateway API specification. This changed the behavior from previous versions\n  of using port `80` as the redirect target when `port` is not given. It will\n  break some uncommon use cases of using `https` scheme and empty `port` in the\n  filter while intending to redirect the requests to HTTPS service in port 80.\n  For such usage, please explicitly specify the `port` to `80` in the filter.\n  [#6804](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6804)\n- Promote `KongCustomEntity` feature gate to GA.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed annotation `konghq.com/rewrite` that was not being applied sometimes\n  when `Ingress` without annotation and a different `Ingress` with annotation\n  pointed to the same `Service`.\n  [#6626](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6626)\n- Fix panic in `KongUpstreamPolicyReconciler` when using with Ingress having a nil HTTP rule.\n  [#6651](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6651)\n- `KongConsumer`s with conflicting credentials will not be translated in Kong\n  configuration to prevent invalid Kong configuration generated. A warning\n  kubernetes event with `KongConfigurationTranslationFailed` will be reported\n  for each involved `KongConsumer`.\n  [#6585](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6585)\n- Fix panic when handling `KongConsumer` without `username` specified.\n  [#6665](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6665)\n- Get rid of redundant log `info  No targets found to create upstream ...` because\n  such misconfiguration is reported to user with Kubernetes events or in the `status`\n  field of an affected object.\n  [#6781](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6781)\n- Fixed Kong client status check causing unnecessary `config update failed` errors\n  and `KongConfigurationApplyFailed` events being generated.\n  [#6689](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6689)\n- Do not emit error logs when group and kind of `parentRef` in a route does not\n  point to a `Gateway` as they can point to other kinds of resources like\n  `Service` when used in service mesh solutions.\n  [#6692](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6692)\n- Set `creationTimestamp` of ancestor in ancestor status of `KongUpstreamPolicy`\n  to make sure the order of ancestors in the status is deterministic to fix\n  the issue where the status of `KongUpstreamPolicy` is continuously updated.\n  [#6767](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6767)\n- Fixed an issue where `KongPlugin` used as `HTTPRoute`'s `ExtensionRef` filter\n  would produce an invalid configuration.\n  [#6762](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6762)\n- Fixed an issue of assigning duplicated instance names to plugins where\n  `KongPlugin`s would be bound to multiple entities, e.g.:\n  - route R1 and consumer group CG\n  - route R2 and consumer group CG\n  [#6786](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6786)\n- Check referenced `KongCustomEntity`'s `parentRef` and verify if referenced\n  `KongPlugin` or `KongClusterPlugin` exists.\n  [#6791](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6791)\n- Fixed validation of JWT credentials using non HMAC algorithms where `secret`\n  field was incorrectly required.\n  [#6848](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6848)\n- There is no redundant space in header `Location` when `HTTPRoute` with\n  requestRedirect filter is used.\n  [#6855](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6855)\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- CRD type bindings under `/pkg` and clientsets under `/pkg/clientset` are deprecated\n  and will be removed in the next major release. Until then, they won't be updated.\n  They were migrated to a new dedicated [repository][kconf]. If you depend on them,\n  please update your dependencies to use the new repository.\n\n[kconf]: https://github.com/kong/kubernetes-configuration\n\n## [3.3.1]\n\n> Release date: 2024-08-28\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `KongUpstreamPolicy` reconciler to not index `HTTPRoute` when Gateway API\n  CRDs are not installed.\n  [#6454](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6454)\n\n## [3.3.0]\n\n> Release date: 2024-08-26\n\n### Highlights\n\n- 📊 **Observability of Konnect Requests**: Instrumented tracing headers for B3\n  propogation and datadog in requests sent to Konnect APIs. When error happens in\n  requests to Konnect APIs, logs with error level are printed with status code\n  and returned tracing data from Konnnect side.\n- 🏗️ **KongCustomEntitty Promoted to Beta**: With multiple improvements of using\n  custom entities in KIC: supporting custom entities in last valid configurations,\n  generating one entity per each referenced foreign entity of `KongCustomEntity`,\n  and allowing `KongCustomEntity` to be referenced in `KongPlugin`s in other\n  namespaces, `KongCustomEntity` feature gate is promoted to beta and enabled by\n  default. This makes using custom entities easier.\n\n### Added\n\n- `KongCustomEntity` is now supported by the `FallbackConfiguration` feature.\n  [#6286](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6286)\n- It is now possible to disable synchronization of consumers to Konnect through the\n  flag `--konnect-disable-consumers-sync`.\n  [#6313](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6313)\n- Allow `KongCustomEntity` to refer to plugins in another namespace via \n  `spec.parentRef.namespace`. The reference is allowed only when there is a\n  `ReferenceGrant` in the namespace of the `KongPlugin` to grant permissions\n  to `KongCustomEntity` of referring to `KongPlugin`.\n  [#6289](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6289)\n- Konnect configuration updates are now handled separately from gateway\n  updates. This allows the controller to handle sync errors for the gateway and\n  Konnect speparately, and avoids one blocking the other.\n  The period of uploading configuration to Konnect changed to 30 seconds by\n  default. The period can be set by the added flag\n  `--konnect-upload-config-period`, with a minimum period of 10 seconds.\n  [#6341](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6341)\n  [#6349](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6349)\n  [#6352](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6352)\n- Added `duration` field in logs after successfully sent configuration to Kong\n  gateway or Konnect.\n  [#6360](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6360)\n- `KongCustomEntity` is now included in last valid configuration retrieved from\n  Kong gateways.\n  [#6305](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6305)\n- Added Prometheus metrics `ingress_controller_translation_duration_milliseconds`\n  and `ingress_controller_fallback_translation_duration_milliseconds` to\n  record duration of translating Kubernetes resources to Kong state in normal\n  state and fallback mode.\n  [#6366](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6366)\n- Instrumented Konnect APIs clients (license, nodes, CP admin) with trace logging.\n  On responses with error status codes, downstream tracing headers are logged with\n  Error level to enable correlating Konnect-side logs and traces with customer-side\n  KIC logs. Successful responses are logged with Trace level.\n  [#6420](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6420)\n- Added flags `--gateway-discovery-readiness-check-interval` and\n  `--gateway-discovery-readiness-check-timeout` to configure interval of\n  reconciliation to check readiness of gateways and timeouts of readiness\n  checks of a gateway instance.\n  Their default values are `10s` and `5s` and the readiness check timeout must\n  be less than the reconciliation interval.\n  [#6434](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6434)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Services using `Secret`s containing the same certificate as client certificates\n  by annotation `konghq.com/client-cert` can be correctly translated.\n  [#6228](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6228)\n- Generate one entity for each attached foreign entity if a `KongCustomEntity`\n  resource is attached to multiple foreign Kong entities.\n  [#6280](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6280)\n- Only reconcile `KongUpstreamPolicy` referenced by `Services` or\n  `KongServiceFacades`(If `KongServiceFacade` features gate enabled) that are\n  used as backends of any `Ingress` or `HTTPRoute` reconciled by current\n  controller.\n  [#6421](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6421)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Promote `KongCustomEntity` feature gate to beta thus it is enabled by default.\n  [#6387](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6387)\n\n## [3.2.4]\n\n> Release date: 2024-08-20\n\n### Changed\n\n- Check Kong Gateway readiness concurrently. This greatly reduces the time which\n  is required to check all Gateway instances readiness, especially when there's many\n  of them. Increased individual readiness check timeout from 1s to 5s.\n  [#6347](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6347)\n  [#6357](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6357)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Do not update `Programmed` condition in status of resources to `Unknown` when\n  there are existing `Programmed` condition.\n  [#6395](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6395)\n\n## 3.2.3\n\n> Release date: 2024-07-23\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the reference checker in checking permission of remote plugins to use\n  the correct namespace of `ReferenceGrant` required. Add trace logging to\n  `ReferenceGrant` check functions.\n  [#6295](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6295)\n  [#6302](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6302)\n\n## 3.2.2\n\n> Release date: 2024-07-01\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where new gateways were not being populated with the current configuration when\n  `FallbackConfiguration` feature gate was turned on. Previously, configuration updates were skipped\n  if the Kubernetes config cache did not change, leading to inconsistencies. Now, the system ensures\n  that all gateways are populated with the latest configuration regardless of cache changes.\n  [#6271](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6271)\n\n## 3.2.1\n\n> Release date: 2024-06-28\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Do not try recovering from gateways synchronization errors with fallback configuration\n  (either generated or the last valid one) when an unexpected error (e.g. 5xx or network issue) occurs.\n  [#6237](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6237)\n- Admission webhook will accept multiple plugins of the same type associated with a single route-like,\n  Service, KongConsumer, KongConsumerGroup object to allow plugins to be associated with combinations\n  of those objects.\n  [#6252](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6252)\n  \n### Added\n- Add `INFO` log when admission result is not allowed\n  [#6084](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/6084)\n\n## 3.2.0\n\n> Release date: 2024-06-12\n\n### Highlights\n\n- 🚀 **Fallback Configuration**: New `FallbackConfiguration` feature enables isolating configuration failure domains so\n  that one broken object no longer prevents the entire configuration from being applied. See [Fallback Configuration guide]\n  to learn more.\n- 🏗️ **Custom Kong Entities**: New `KongCustomEntity` CRD allows defining Kong custom entities programmatically in KIC.\n  See [Using Custom Entities guide] to learn more.\n- 📨 **GRPCRoute v1 support**: Following the GA graduation in the Gateway API, KIC now supports the v1 version of the GRPCRoute.\n  See [GRPCRoute reference] to learn more. _Requires upgrading the Gateway API's CRDs to v1.1._\n\n[Fallback Configuration guide]: https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/high-availability/fallback-config/\n[Using Custom Entities guide]: https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/services/custom-entity\n[GRPCRoute reference]: https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/grpcroute/\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Removed support for the deprecated `kongCredType` Secret field. If you have\n  not previously [updated to the credential label](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/migrate/credential-kongcredtype-label/)\n  you must do so before upgrading to this version. This removal includes an\n  update to the webhook configuration that checks only Secrets with\n  `konghq.com/credential` or `konghq.com/validate` labels (for Secrets that\n  contain plugin configuration). This filter improves performance and\n  reliability by not checking Secrets the controller will never use. Users that\n  wish to defer adding `konghq.com/validate` to Secrets with plugin\n  configuration can set the `ingressController.admissionWebhook.filterSecrets`\n  chart values.yaml key to `false`. Doing so does not benefit from the\n  performance benefits, however, so labeling plugin configuration Secrets and\n  enabling the filter is recommended as soon as is convenient.\n  [#5856](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5856)\n- Dynamically set the proxy protocol of GRPCRoute to `grpc` or `grpcs` based on the port listened by Gateway.\n  If you don't set the protocol for Service via `konghq.com/protocol` annotation, Kong will use `grpc` instead of `grpcs`.\n  [#5776](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5776)\n- The `/debug/config/failed` and `/debug/config/successful` diagnostic\n  endpoints now nest configuration dumps under a `config` key. These endpoints\n  previously returned the configuration dump at the root. They now return\n  additional metadata along with the configuration. This change should not\n  impact normal usage, but if you scrape these endpoints, be aware that their\n  output format has changed.\n  [#6101](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6101)\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `FallbackConfiguration` feature gate to enable the controller to generate a fallback configuration\n  for Kong when it fails to apply the original one. The feature gate is disabled by default.\n  [#5993](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5993)\n  [#6010](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6010)\n  [#6047](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6047)\n  [#6071](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6071)\n- Added `--use-last-valid-config-for-fallback` CLI flag to enable using the last valid configuration cache\n  to backfill excluded broken objects when the `FallbackConfiguration` feature gate is enabled.\n  [#6098](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6098)\n- Added `FallbackKongConfigurationSucceeded`, `FallbackKongConfigurationTranslationFailed` and\n  `FallbackKongConfigurationApplyFailed` Kubernetes Events to report the status of the fallback configuration.\n  [#6099](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6099)\n- Added Prometheus metrics covering `FallbackConfiguration` feature:\n  - `ingress_controller_fallback_translation_count`\n  - `ingress_controller_fallback_translation_broken_resource_count`\n  - `ingress_controller_fallback_configuration_push_count`\n  - `ingress_controller_fallback_configuration_push_last`\n  - `ingress_controller_fallback_configuration_push_duration_milliseconds`\n  - `ingress_controller_fallback_configuration_push_broken_resource_count`\n  - `ingress_controller_fallback_cache_generating_duration_milliseconds`\n  - `ingress_controller_processed_config_snapshot_cache_hit`\n  - `ingress_controller_processed_config_snapshot_cache_miss`\n    [#6105](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6105)\n- Added a `GET /debug/config/fallback` diagnostic endpoint to expose the fallback configuration\n  details (currently broken, excluded and backfilled objects, as well as the overall status).\n  [#6184](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6184)\n- Added the CRD `KongCustomEntity` to support custom Kong entities that are not\n  defined in KIC yet. The current version only supports translating custom\n  entities into declarative configuration in DBless mode, and cannot apply\n  custom entities to DB backed Kong gateways.\n  Feature gate `KongCustomEntity` is required to set to `true` to enabled the\n  `KongCustomEntity` controller.\n  **Note**: The IDs of Kong services, routes and consumers referred by custom\n  entities via `foreign` type fields of custom entities are filled by the `FillID`\n  method of the corresponding type because the IDs of these entities are required\n  to fill the `foreign` fields of custom entities. So the `FillIDs` feature gate\n  is also required when `KongCustomEntity` is enabled.\n  [#5982](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5982)\n  [#6006](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6006)\n  [#6055](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6055)\n- Add support for Kubernetes Gateway API v1.1:\n  - add a flag `--enable-controller-gwapi-grpcroute` to control whether enable or disable GRPCRoute controller.\n  - add support for `GRPCRoute` v1, which requires users to upgrade the Gateway API's CRD to v1.1.\n    [#5918](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5918)\n- Add a `/debug/config/raw-error` endpoint to the config dump diagnostic\n  server. This endpoint outputs the original Kong `/config` endpoint error for\n  failed configuration pushes in case error parsing fails. Attempt to log the\n  `message` field of errors that KIC cannot fully parse.\n  [#5773](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/5773), [#5846](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5846)\n- Add constraint to limit items in `Credentials` and `ConsumerGroups` in\n  `KongConsumer`s to be unique by defining their `x-kubernetes-list-type` as `set`.\n  Please note that if you're using `helm` as the installation method, upgrading alone\n  won't make this change take effect until you manually update the CRD manifests in your\n  cluster to the current version. See [Updates to CRDs] for more details.\n  [#5894](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5894)\n- Add support in `HTTPRoute`s for `URLRewrite`:\n  - `FullPathRewrite` [#5855](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5855)\n  - `ReplacePrefixMatch` for both router modes:\n    - `traditional_compatible` [#5895](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5895)\n    - `expressions` [#5940](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5940)\n  - `Hostname` [#5952](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5952)\n- DB mode now supports Event reporting for resources that failed to apply.\n  [#5785](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5785)\n- Improve validation - reject `Ingresses`, `Services`, `HTTPRoutes`, `KongConsumers` or `KongConsumerGroups`\n  that have multiple instances of the same type plugin attached.\n  [#5972](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5972)\n  [#5979](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5979)\n- Added support for `konghq.com/headers-separator` that allows to set custom separator (instead of default `,`)\n  for headers specified with `konghq.com/headers.*` annotations. Moreover parsing a content of `konghq.com/headers.*`\n  is more robust - leading and trailing whitespace characters are discarded.\n  [#5977](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5977)\n- The `konghq.com/plugins` annotation supports a new `<namespace>:<name>`\n  format. This format requests a KongPlugin from a remote namespace. Binding\n  plugins across namespaces requires a ReferenceGrant from the requesting\n  resource to KongPlugins in the target namespace. This approach is useful for\n  some plugins bound to different types of entities, such as a set of\n  rate-limiting plugins applied to a service and various consumers. The\n  cross-namespace grant allows the service manager to define different limits\n  for consumers managed by other users without requiring those users to create\n  consumers in the Service's namespace.\n  [#5965](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5965)\n- The last valid configuration no longer omits licenses and vaults.\n  [#6048](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6048)\n- Add support for Gateway API GRPCRoute and pass related Gateway API conformance test.\n  [#5776](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5776)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Set proper User-Agent for request made to Kong and Konnect.\n  [#5753](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5753)\n- Reconcile Secrets with `konghq.com/credential` label instead of waiting for other\n  object to contain a reference to that Secrets\n  [#5816](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5816)\n- Support to apply licenses to DB backed Kong gateway from `KongLicense`.\n  [#5648](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5648)\n- Do not generate invalid duplicate upstream targets when routes use multiple\n  Services with the same endpoints.\n  [#5817](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5817)\n- Remove the constraint of items of `parentRefs` can only be empty or \n  `gateway.network.k8s.io/Gateway` in validating `HTTPRoute`s.

Now users can create a `KongVault` to\n  create a custom Kong vault and reference the values in configurations of\n  plugins. Reference of using Kong vaults: [Kong vault](kong-vault). Since the prefix of\n  Kong vault is restrained unique, the `spec.prefix` field is set to immutable,\n  and only one of multiple `KongVault`s with the same `spec.prefix` will get\n  translated. Translation failiure events will be recorded for others with\n  duplicating `spec.prefix`.\n  [#5354](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5354)\n  [#5384](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5384)\n  [#5435](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5435)\n  [#5412](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5412)\n- New CRD `KongLicense` to represent a Kong enterprise license to apply to\n  managed Kong gateway enterprise instances. The `Enabled` field of `KongLicense`\n  (set to `True` if not present) need to be set to true to get reconciled.\n  If there are multiple `KongLicense`s in the cluster, the newest one\n  (with latest `metadata.creationTimestamp`) is chosen. The `KongLicense`\n  controller is disabled when synchoroniztion of license with Konnect is turned\n  on. When sync license with Konnect is turned on, licenses from Konnect are used.  \n  [#5487](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5487)\n  [#5514](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5514)\n- Added `configPatches` field to KongPlugin and KongClusterPlugin to\n  support populating configuration fields from Secret values. An item in\n  `configPatches` defines a JSON patch to add a field on the path in its `path`\n  and value from the value in the secret given in `valueFrom`. The JSON patches\n  are applied to the raw JSON in `config`. Can only be specified when\n  `configFrom` is not present.\n  [#5158](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5158)\n  [#5208](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5208)\n- Added `SanitizeKonnectConfigDumps` feature gate allowing to enable sanitizing\n  sensitive data (like TLS private keys, Secret-sourced Plugins configuration, etc.)\n  in Konnect configuration dumps. It's turned on by default.\n  [#5489](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5489)\n  [#5573](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5573)\n- Kong Plugin's `config` field now is sanitized when it contains sensitive data\n  sourced from a Secret (i.e. `configFrom` or `configPatches` is used).\n  [#5495](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5495)\n- `KongServiceFacade` CRD allowing creating Kong Services directly from Kubernetes using\n  Kubernetes Services as their backends. `KongServiceFacade` can be used as a backend in\n  Kubernetes Ingress. This API is highly experimental and is not distributed by default.\n  It can be installed with `kubectl kustomize \"github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/config/crd/incubator/?ref=v3.1.0\"`\n  When installed, it has to be enabled with `ServiceFacade` feature gate.\n  [#5220](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5220)\n  [#5234](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5234)\n  [#5290](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5290)\n  [#5282](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5282)\n  [#5298](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5298)\n  [#5302](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5302)\n- Added support for GRPC over HTTP (without TLS) in Gateway API.\n  [#5128](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5128)\n  [#5283](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5283)\n- Added `--init-cache-sync-duration` CLI flag. This flag configures how long the\n  controller waits for Kubernetes resources to populate at startup before\n  generating the initial Kong configuration. It also fixes a bug that removed\n  the default 5 second wait period.\n  [#5238](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5238)\n- Added `--emit-kubernetes-events` CLI flag to disable the creation of events\n  in translating and applying configurations to Kong.\n  [#5296](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5296)\n  [#5299](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5299)\n- Added validation on `Secret`s to reject the change if it will generate\n  invalid confiugration of plugins for `KongPlugin`s or `KongClusterPlugin`s\n  referencing to the secret.\n  [#5203](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5203)\n- Validate `HTTPRoute` in admission webhook and reject it if the spec uses\n  the following features that we do not support:\n  - `parentRefs` other than `gatewayapi.networking.k8s.io/Gateway`\n  - using `timeouts` in rules\n  - `URLRewrite`, `RequestMirror` filters\n  - using filters in backendRefs of rules\n  [#5312](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5312)\n- Added functionality to the `KongUpstreamPolicy` controller to properly set and\n  enforce `KongUpstreamPolicy` status. \n  The controller will set an ancestor status in `KongUpstreamPolicy` status for \n  each of its ancestors (i.e. `Service` or `KongServiceFacade`) with the `Accepted`\n  and `Programmed` condition.\n  [#5185](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5185)\n  [#5428](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5428)\n  [#5444](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5444)\n- Added flag `--gateway-to-reconcile` to set KIC to only reconcile\n  the specified Gateway resource in Kubernetes.\n  [#5405](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5405)\n- Added support for `HTTPRouteTimeoutBackendRequest` in Gateway API.\n  Due to only one field being available in the Gateway API to control this behavior,\n  when users set `spec.rules[].timeouts` in HTTPRoute,\n  KIC will set `connect_timeout`, `read_timeout` and `write_timeout` for the service to this value.\n  It's only possible to set the same timeout for each rule in a single `HTTPRoute`. Other settings\n  will be rejected by the admission webhook validation.\n  [#5243](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5243)\n- Log the details in response from Konnect when failed to push configuration\n  to Konnect.\n  [#5453](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5453)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Validators of `KongPlugin` and `KongClusterPlugin` will not return `500` on\n  failures to parse configurations and failures to retrieve secrets used for\n  configuration. Instead, it will return `400` with message to tell the\n  validation failures.\n  [#5208](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5208)\n- Fixed an issue that prevented the controller from associating admin API\n  errors with a GRPCRoute.\n  [#5267](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5267)\n  [#5275](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5275)\n- Restore the diagnostics server functionality, which was accidentally disabled.\n  [#5270](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5270)\n- Allow configuring a GRPCRoute without hostnames and matches that catch all\n  requests.\n  [#5303](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5303)\n- Allow the `ws` and `wss` Enterprise protocol values for protocol annotations.\n  [#5399](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5399)\n- Add a `workspace` parameter in filling IDs of Kong entities to avoid\n  duplicate IDs cross different workspaces.\n  [#5401](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5401)\n- Support properly ConsumerGroups when fallback to the last valid configuration.\n  [#5438](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5438)\n- When specifying Gateway API Routes' `backendRef`s with namespace specified, those\n  refs are checked for existence and allowed if they exist.\n  [#5392](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5392)\n- Unmanaged Gateway mode honors the `--publish-status-address(-udp)` flags. If\n  set, the controller will set these addresses in the Gateway status addresses\n  instead of the proxy service/publish service addresses. The controller _no\n  longer sets addresses in the Gateway spec addresses_. Review of the official\n  specification indicated that the spec addresses are for user address\n  requests, and that implementations can and should set status addresses to a\n  different set of addresses if they assign addresses other than the requested\n  set.\n  [#5445](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5445)\n- Fixed a potential race condition that could occur when fetching the last applied\n  or failed-to-be-applied config from the diagnostics server. The race could occur\n  if the config was being updated while the HTTP endpoint was being hit at the same\n  time.\n  [#5474](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5474)\n- Stale `HTTPRoute`'s parent statuses are now removed when the `HTTPRoute` no longer\n  defines a parent `Gateway` in its `spec.parentRefs`.\n  [#5477](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5477)\n- `expressions` router flavor can now successfully be used with Konnect synchronization\n  turned on. The controller will no longer populate disallowed `regex_priority` and `path_handling`\n  Kong Route's fields when the router flavor is `expressions` that were causing Konnect to reject\n  the configuration.\n  [#5581](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5581)\n\n### Changed\n\n- `SecretKeyRef` of `ConfigFrom` field in `KongPlugin` and `KongClusterPlugin`\n  are `Required`. When `ConfigFrom` is specified, the validation of there CRDs\n  will require `SecretKeyRef` to be present.\n  [#5103](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5103)\n- CRD Validation Expressions\n  - `KongPlugin` and `KongClusterPlugin` now enforce only one of `config` and `configFrom`\n    to be set.\n    [#5119](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5119)\n  - `KongConsumer` now enforces that at least one of `username` or `custom_id` is provided.\n    [#5137](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5137)\n  - `KongPlugin` and `KongClusterPlugin` now enforce `plugin` to be immutable.\n    [#5142](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5142)\n- `HTTPRoute` does no longer get rejected by the admission webhook when:\n  - There's no `Gateway`'s `Listener` with `AllowedRoutes` matching the `HTTPRoute`.\n  - There's no `Gateway`'s `Listener` with `Protocol` matching the `HTTPRoute`.\n  - There's no `Gateway`'s `Listener` matching `HTTPRoute`'s `ParentRef`'s `SectionName`.\n  All of these are validated by the controller and the results are reported in a `HTTPRoute`'s\n  `Accepted` condition reported for a `Gateway`.\n  [#5469](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5469)\n\n[kong-vault]: https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/secrets-management/\n\n## [3.0.2]\n\n> Release date: 2024-01-11\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `--emit-kubernetes-events` CLI flag to disable the creation of events\n  in translating and applying configurations to Kong.\n  [#5296](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5296)\n  [#5299](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5299)\n- Added `-init-cache-sync-duration` CLI flag. This flag configures how long the controller waits for Kubernetes resources to populate at startup before generating the initial Kong configuration. It also fixes a bug that removed the default 5 second wait period.\n  [#5238](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5238)\n\n## [3.0.1]\n\n> Release date: 2023-11-22\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Using an Ingress with annotation `konghq.com/rewrite` and another Ingress without it pointing to the same Service,\n  will no longer cause synchronization loop and random request failures due to incorrect routing.\n  [#5218](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5218)\n- Using the same Service in one Ingress as a target for ingress rule and default backend works without issues.\n  [#5219](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5219)\n\n## [3.0.0]\n\n> Release date: 2023-11-03\n\n### Highlights\n\n- 🚀 Support for [Gateway API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateways/) is now GA!\n  - You only need to install Gateway API CRDs to use GA features of Gateway API with KIC.\n  - Check the [Ingress to Gateway migration guide] to learn how to start using Gateway API already.\n- 📈 Gateway Discovery feature is enabled by default both in DB-less and DB mode, allowing for scaling\n  your gateways independently of the controller.\n- 📖 Brand-new docs: [The KIC docs] have been totally revamped to be Gateway API first, and every single guide\n  is as easy as copying and pasting your way down the page.\n\n[Ingress to Gateway migration guide]: https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/migrate/ingress-to-gateway/\n[The KIC docs]: https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Only Kong Gateway in version >= 3.4.1 is supported. The controller will refuse to start\n  if the version is lower, also won't discover such Kong Gateways.\n  [#4766](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4766)\n- Removed feature gates: \n  - `CombinedServices`: The feature is enabled and it can't be changed.\n    [#4743](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4743)\n  - `CombinedRoutes`: The feature is enabled and it can't be changed.\n    [#4749](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4749)\n  - `ExpressionRoutes`: The feature is enabled and it can't be changed.\n    KIC now translates to expression based Kong routes when Kong's router flavor `expressions`.\n    [#4892](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4892)\n- Removed Knative support.\n  [#4748](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4748)\n- The \"text\" logging format has changed. \"json\" should be used for\n  machine-parseable logs.\n  [#4688](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4688)\n- The \"warn\", \"fatal\", and \"panic\" log levels are no longer available. \"error\"\n  is now the highest log level. \"warn\" logs are now logged at \"error\" level.\n  [#4688](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4688)\n- Removed support for deprecated `KongIngress` fields: `Proxy` and `Route`. Respective\n  `Service` or `Ingress` annotations should be used instead. See [KIC Annotations reference].\n  [#4760](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4760)\n- Removed previously deprecated CLI flags:\n  - `sync-rate-limit`\n  - `stderrthreshold`\n  - `update-status-on-shutdown`\n  - `kong-custom-entities-secret`\n  - `leader-elect`\n  - `enable-controller-ingress-extensionsv1beta1`\n  - `enable-controller-ingress-networkingv1beta1`\n    [#4770](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4770)\n  - `debug-log-reduce-redundancy`\n    [#4688](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4688)\n- `--konnect-runtime-group-id` CLI flag is now deprecated. Please use `--konnect-control-plane-id`\n  instead.\n  [#4783](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4783)\n- All manifests from `deploy/single` are no longer supported as installation\n  method and were removed, please use Helm chart or Kong Gateway Operator instead.\n  [#4866](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4866)\n  [#4873](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4873)\n  [#4970](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4970)\n- Credentials now use a `konghq.com/credential` label to indicate\n  credential type instead of the `kongCredType` field. This allows controller\n  compontents to avoid caching unnecessary Secrets. The `kongCredType` field is\n  still supported but is now deprecated.\n  See the [Migrate Credential Type Labels] guide to see how to update your `Secrets` smoothly.\n- `KongIngress` is now entirely deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n  Its fields that were previously deprecated (`proxy` and `route`) are now not allowed to be set.\n  They must be migrated to annotations. `upstream` field is deprecated - it's recommended\n  to migrate its settings to the new `KongUpstreamPolicy` resource.\n  See the [KongIngress to KongUpstreamPolicy migration guide] for details.\n  [#5022](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5022)\n- Fixed `HTTPRoute` and `KongConsumer` admission webhook validators to properly\n  signal validation failures, resulting in returning responses with `AdmissionResponse`\n  filled instead of 500 status codes. It will make them work as expected in cases where\n  the `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` has `failurePolicy: Ignore`.\n  This will enable validations of `HTTPRoute` and `KongConsumer` that were previously only\n  accidentally effective with `failurePolicy: Fail`, thus it can be considered a breaking change.\n  [#5063](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5063)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- No more \"log.SetLogger(...) was never called...\" log entry during shutdown of KIC\n  [#4738](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4738)\n- Changes to referenced Secrets are now tracked independent of their referent.\n  [#4758](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4758)\n- When Kong returns a flattened error related to a Kong entity, the entity's type and name\n  will be included in the message reported in `KongConfigurationApplyFailed` Kubernetes event\n  generated for it.\n  [#4813](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4813)\n- Fixed an incorrect watch, set in UDPRoute controller watching UDProute status updates.\n  [#4835](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4835)\n- Fixed setting proper destination port for TCPRoute and UDPRoute, now field `SectionName`\n  for `TCPRoute` and `UDPRoute` works as expected. It **breaks** some configurations that\n  relied on matching multiple Gateway's listener ports to ports of services automatically.\n  [#4928](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4928)\n- Fixed a panic when receiving broken configuration from Kong Gateway.\n  [#5003](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5003)\n- Use 46 bits in values of priorities of generated Kong routes when expression\n  rotuer is enabled to limit the priorities to be less than `1e14`. This\n  prevents them to be encoded into scientific notation when dumping \n  configurations from admin API that brings precision loss and type \n  inconsistency in decoding JSON/YAML data to `uint64`. \n  This change will limit number of `HTTPRoute`s that can be \n  deterministically sorted by their creation timestamps, names and internal\n  rule orders to `2^12=4096` and number of `GRPCRoutes` can be sorted to `2^8=256`.\n  [#5024](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5024)\n- Error logs emitted from Gateway Discovery readiness checker that should be\n  logged at `debug` level are now logged at that level.\n  [#5029](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5029)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Update paths of Konnect APIs from `runtime_groups/*` to `control-planes/*`.\n  [#4566](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4566)\n- Docker images now use UID and GID 1000 to match Kong images. This should have\n  no user-facing effect.\n  [#4911](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4911)\n- Bump version of gateway API to `1.0.0` and support `Gateway`, `GatewayClass`\n  and `HTTPRoute` in API version `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1`.\n  [#4893](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4893)\n  [#4981](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4981)\n  [#5041](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5041)\n- Update `Gateway`s, `GatewayClass`es and `HTTPRoute`s in examples to API\n  version `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1`.\n  [#4935](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4935)\n- Controller to admin API communications are exempted from mesh proxies when\n  the controller resides in a separate Deployment. This allows the controller\n  to manage its own mTLS negotiation.\n  [#4942](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4942)\n- Remove `Gateway` feature flag for Gateway API.\n  [#4968](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4968)\n\n  It was enabled by default since 2.6.0 so the default behavior doesn't change.\n  If users want to disable related functionality, they still can by disabling\n  related Gateway API controllers via setting the following flags to `false`:\n  - `--enable-controller-gwapi-gateway`\n  - `--enable-controller-gwapi-httproute`\n  - `--enable-controller-gwapi-reference-grant`\n- Count `HTTPRoute` to gateway's number of attached route if the gateway is\n  present in its `status.parents`, even if the gateway has unresolved refs.\n  [#4987](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4987)\n- The default value for `--kong-admin-svc-port-names` is now `\"admin-tls,kong-admin-tls\"`\n  instead of `\"admin,admin-tls,kong-admin,kong-admin-tls\"`. HTTP port names\n  have been removed as discovery does not support plaintext HTTP connections.\n  Instances configured with both HTTP and HTTPS admin ports resulted in\n  discovery unsuccessfully trying to use HTTPS to talk to HTTP ports.\n  [#5043](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5043)\n- The log format has been standardized to start with uppercase letters.\n  [#5033](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5033)\n  [#5035](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5035)\n  [#5037](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5037)\n  [#5038](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5038)\n  [#5049](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5049)\n  [#5050](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5050)\n  [#5065](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5065)\n\n### Added\n\n- Added support for expression-based Kong routes for `TLSRoute`. This requires\n  Kong installed with `KONG_ROUTER_FLAVOR=expressions` set in the environment.\n  [#4574](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4574).\n- The `FillIDs` feature gate is now enabled by default.\n  [#4746](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4746)\n- Get rid of deprecation warning in logs for unsupported label `global: true` for `KongPlugin`,\n  it'll be treated as any other label without a special meaning.\n  [#4737](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4737)\n- Telemetry now reports the router flavor.\n  [#4762](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4762)\n- Support Query Parameter matching of `HTTPRoute` when expression router enabled.\n  [#4780](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4780)\n- Support `ExtensionRef` HTTPRoute filter. It is now possibile to set a KongPlugin\n  reference in the `HTTPRoute`s' `ExtensionRef` filter field.\n  [#4838](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4838)\n- Added `--kong-admin-token-file` flag to provide the Kong admin token via a\n  file. This is an alternative to the existing `--kong-admin-token` for users\n  that prefer to mount a file over binding a Secret to an environment variable\n  value. Only one of the two options can be used.\n  [#4808](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4808)\n- New `KongUpstreamPolicy` CRD superseding `KongIngress.Upstream` was introduced.\n  It allows overriding Kong Upstream settings generated for a specific `Service` used\n  in an `Ingress` or Gateway API `Route`. A policy can be applied to a `Service` by\n  setting `konghq.com/upstream-policy: <policy-name>` annotation on the `Service` object.\n  Read more in [KIC CRDs reference].\n  [#4880](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4880)\n  [#4943](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4943)\n  [#4955](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4955)\n  [#4957](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4957)\n  [#4969](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4969)\n  [#4979](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4979)\n  [#4989](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4989)\n- KIC now specifies its `UserAgent` when communicating with kube-apiserver\n  as `kong-ingress-controller/${VERSION}` where version is the version of KIC.\n  [#5019](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5019)\n- Allow Gateway Discovery with database backed Kong. KIC will send Kong \n  configurations to one of the backend pods of the service specified by the\n  flag `--kong-admin-svc` if Kong gateway is DB backed.\n  [#4828](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4828)\n\n[KIC Annotations reference]: https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/references/annotations/\n[KIC CRDs reference]: https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/references/custom-resources/\n[KongIngress to KongUpstreamPolicy migration guide]: https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/migrate/kongingress/\n[Migrate Credential Type Labels]: https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/migrate/credential-kongcredtype-label/\n\n## [2.12.7]\n\n> Release date: 2024-11-25\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Bump go-kong to v0.56.0 to fix [#6703](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/6703) \n  This way, the OTEL plugin can work properly when the Gateway is upgraded from 3.6 to 3.7.\n  Also upgraded the Go version to v1.22.\n  [#6657](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6657)\n\n## [2.12.6]\n\n> Release date: 2024-08-20\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Do not update `Programmed` condition in status of resources to `Unknown` when\n  there are existing `Programmed` condition.\n  [#6395](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6395)\n- Reconcile `Secret`s with `kongCredType` in data implying that the secrets are\n  used as Kong credentials.\t  used as Kong credentials.\n  [#6400](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6400)\t  [#6400](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6400)\n\n## [2.12.5]\n\n> Release date: 2024-06-25\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Services using `Secret`s containing the same certificate as client certificates\n  by annotation `konghq.com/client-cert` can be correctly translated.\n  [#6228](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/6228)\n\n## [2.12.4]\n\n> Release date: 2024-04-30\n\n- Bump golang version to 1.21.9 to fix CVE [GO-2024-2687](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687).\n  [#5916](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5916)\n- Bump `golang.org/x/net` to `0.23.0` and `google.golang.org/protobuf` to `1.33.0`\n  To fix [GO-2024-2687](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687) and [GO-2024-2611](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2611).\n  [#5947](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5947)\n\n## [2.12.3]\n\n> Release date: 2023-12-19\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix(manager): set InitCacheSyncDuration to 5s by default and allow it to be configured via `--init-cache-sync-duration` CLI flag\n  [#5238](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5238)\n- Don't set `instance_name` of plugin if Kong version is below 3.2.0.\n  [#5250](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5250)\n- Added `--emit-kubernetes-events` CLI flag to disable the creation of events\n  in translating and applying configurations to Kong.\n  [#5296](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5296)\n  [#5299](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5299)\n\n## [2.12.2]\n\n> Release date: 2023-11-22\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Using an Ingress with annotation `konghq.com/rewrite` and another Ingress without it pointing to the same Service,\n  will no longer cause synchronization loop and random request failures due to incorrect routing.\n  [#5215](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5215)\n- Using the same Service in one Ingress as a target for ingress rule and default backend works without issues.\n  [#5217](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5217)\n\n### Known issues\n\n- **Only when combined routes are not enabled**, generated Kong routes may have conflicting names, that leads to\n  incorrect routing.

[#2813](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2813)\n- `KongIngress` for `Service` and `Route` parameters has been deprecated since KIC 2.8 and will be removed in KIC 3.0.\n    - We expect to eventually deprecate `KongIngress` also for `Upstream` parameters as described in [#3174](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/3174)\n- Existing Kustomize (`deploy/manifests/`) and `deploy/single/` YAML manifests as a method of installing KIC.\n    - The `deploy/single/` and `deploy/manifests/` directories will no longer work with KIC 3.0+. You should use the [Helm chart](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/deployment/k4k8s/#helm) or [Kong Gateway Operator](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-operator/latest/) instead.\n- DB-less deployments of Kong running with KIC as a sidecar. The [Gateway Discovery](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/using-gateway-discovery/) feature added in KIC 2.9 should be used instead.\n    - The mode where Kong runs with a database (Postgres) is not affected by the migration to Gateway Discovery yet, but likely will in the future [#4751](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4751)\n\n### Added\n\n- `konghq.com/rewrite` annotation has been introduced to manage URI rewriting.\n  This feature requires enabling the `RewriteURIs` feature gate.\n  [#4360](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4360), [#4646](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4646)\n- Provide validation in admission webhook for `Ingress` paths (validate regex expressions).\n  [#4647](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4647)\n  [#4360](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4360)\n- Added support for expression-based Kong routes for `TCPRoute`, `UDPRoute`,\n  `TCPIngress`, and `UDPIngress`. This requires the `ExpressionRoutes` feature\n  gate and a Kong 3.4+ install with `KONG_ROUTER_FLAVOR=expressions` set in the\n  environment.\n  [#4385](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4385)\n  [#4550](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4550)\n  [#4612](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4612)\n- `KongIngress` CRD now supports `latency` algorithm in its `upstream.algorithm`\n  field. This can be used with Kong Gateway 3.2+.\n  [#4703](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4703)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Generate wildcard routes to match all `HTTP` or `GRPC` requests for rules\n  in `HTTPRoute` or `GRPCRoute` if there are no matches in the rule and no\n  hostnames in their parent objects.\n  [#4526](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4528)\n- The Gateway API has been bumped to 0.8.1.\n  [#4700](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4700)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Allow regex expressions in `HTTPRoute` configuration and provide validation in admission webhook.\n  Before this change admission webhook used to reject entirely such configurations incorrectly as not supported yet.\n  [#4608](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4608)\n- Do not parse error body when failed to get response from reloading declarative\n  configurations to produce proper error log in such situations,\n  [#4666](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4666)\n- Set type meta of objects when adding them to caches and reference indexers\n  to ensure that indexes of objects in reference indexers have correct object\n  kind. This ensures referece relations of objects are stored and indexed\n  correctly.\n  [#4663](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4663)\n- Display Service ports on generated Kong services, instead of a static default\n  value. This change is cosmetic only.\n  [#4503](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4503)\n- Create routes that match any service and method for `GRPCRoute` rules with no\n  matches.\n  [#4512](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4512)\n- KongPlugins used on multiple resources will no longer result in\n  `instance_name` collisions.\n  [#4588](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4588)\n- Fix `panic` when last known configuration fetcher gets a `nil` Status when requesting\n  `/status` from Kong Gateway.\n  This happens when Gateway is responding with a 50x HTTP status code.\n  [#4627](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4627)\n- Ensure the API server is available at startup and do not disable CRD\n  controllers if Kong CRDs are unavailable. Do not disable the Ingress\n  controller if the Ingress API is unavailable. This avoids incorrectly\n  deleting existing configuration during an API server restart.\n  [#4641](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4641)\n  [#4643](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4643)\n- Fix `Licenses` and `ConsumerGroups` missing in sanitized copies of Kong configuration.\n  [#4710](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4710)\n\n## [2.11.1]\n\n> Release date: 2023-08-29\n\n### Changed\n\n- Bumped the default Kong version to 3.4 in example manifests.\n  [#4534](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4534)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Disable KongPlugin and KongClusterPlugin Programmed statuses. These were\n  introduced in 2.11.0 and caused excessively frequent status updates in\n  clusters with multiple KIC instances installed.\n  [#4584](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4584)\n\n## [2.11.0]\n\n> Release date: 2023-08-09\n\n### Added\n\n- Introduce `KongConsumerGroup` CRD (supported by Kong Enterprise only)\n  [#4325](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4325)\n  [#4387](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4387)\n  [#4419](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4419)\n  [#4437](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4437)\n  [#4452](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4452)\n- The ResponseHeaderModifier Gateway API filter is now supported and translated\n  to the proper set of Kong plugins.\n  [#4350](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4350)\n- The `CombinedServices` feature gate is now enabled by default.\n  [#4138](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4138)\n- Plugin CRDs now support the `instance_name` field introduced in Kong 3.2.\n  [#4174](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4174)\n- Gateway resources no longer use the _Ready_ condition following changes to\n  the upstream Gateway API specification in version 0.7.\n  [#4142](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4142)\n- Prometheus metrics now include counts of resources that the controller cannot\n  send to the proxy instances and the last successful configuration push time.\n  [#4181](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4181)\n- Store the last known good configuration. If Kong rejects the latest\n  configuration, send the last good configuration to Kong instances with no\n  configuration. This allows newly-started Kong instances to serve traffic even\n  if a configuration error prevents the controller from sending the latest\n  configuration.\n  [#4205](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4205)\n- Telemetry reports now include the OpenShift version, if any.\n  [#4211](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4211)\n- Assign priorities to routes translated from Ingresses when parser translate\n  them to expression based Kong routes. The assigning method is basically the\n  same as in Kong gateway's `traditional_compatible` router, except that\n  `regex_priority` field in Kong traditional route is not supported. This\n  method is adopted to keep the compatibility with traditional router on\n  maximum effort.\n  [#4240](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4240)\n- Assign priorities to routes translated from HTTPRoutes when parser translates\n  them to expression based Kong routes. The assigning method follows the\n  [specification on priorities of matches in `HTTPRoute`][httproute-specification].\n  [#4296](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4296)\n  [#4434](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4434)\n- Assign priorities to routes translated from GRPCRoutes when the parser translates\n  them to expression based Kong routes. The priority order follows the\n  [specification on match priorities in GRPCRoute][grpcroute-specification].\n  [#4364](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4364)\n- When a translated Kong configuration is empty in DB-less mode, the controller\n  will now send the configuration with a single empty `Upstream`. This is to make\n  Gateways using `/status/ready` as their health check ready after receiving the\n  initial configuration (even if it's empty).\n  [#4316](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4316)\n- Fetch the last known good configuration from existing proxy instances. If\n  KIC restarts, it is now able to fetch the last good configuration from a running\n  proxy instance and store it in its internal cache.\n  [#4265](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4265)\n- Gateway Discovery feature was adapted to handle Gateways that are not ready yet\n  in terms of accepting data-plane traffic, but are ready to accept configuration\n  updates. The controller will now send configuration to such Gateways and will\n  actively monitor their readiness for accepting configuration updates.\n  [#4368](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4368)\n- `KongConsumer`, `KongConsumerGroup` `KongPlugin`, and `KongClusterPlugin` CRDs were extended with\n  `Status.Conditions` field. It will contain the `Programmed` condition describing\n  whether an object was successfully translated into Kong entities and sent to Kong.\n  [#4409](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4409)\n  [#4412](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4412)\n  [#4423](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4423)\n- `KongConsumer`, `KongConsumerGroup`, `KongPlugin`, and `KongClusterPlugin`'s `additionalPrinterColumns`\n  were extended with `Programmed` column. It will display the status of the\n  `Programmed` condition of an object when `kubectl get` is used.\n  [#4425](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4425)\n  [#4423](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4423)\n- Parser instead of logging errors for invalid `KongPlugin` or `KongClusterPlugin`\n  configuration, will now propagate a translation failure that will result\n  in the `Programmed` condition of the object being set to `False` and an\n  event being emitted.\n  [#4428](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4428)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Log message `no active endpoints` is now logged at debug instead of\n  warning level.\n  [#4161](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4161)\n- Events and logs for inconsistent multi-Service backend annotations now list\n  all involved Services, not just Services whose annotation does not match the\n  first observed value, as that value is not necessarily the desired value.\n  [#4171](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4171)\n- Use [`gojson`][gojson] for marshalling JSON when generating SHA for config.\n  This should yield some performance benefits during config preparation and\n  sending stage (we've observed around 35% reduced time in config marshalling\n  time but be aware that your mileage may vary).\n  [#4222](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4222)\n- Changed the Gateway's readiness probe in all-in-one manifests from `/status`\n  to `/status/ready`. Gateways will be considered ready only after an initial\n  configuration is applied by the controller.\n  [#4368](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4368)\n- When translating to expression based Kong routes, annotations to specify\n  protocols are translated to `protocols` field of the result Kong route,\n  instead of putting the conditions to match protocols inside expressions.\n  [#4422](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4422)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Correctly support multi-Service backends that have multiple Services sharing\n  the same name in different namespaces.\n  [#4375](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4375)\n- Properly construct targets for IPv6-only clusters.\n  [#4391](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4391)\n- Attach kubernetes events to `KongConsumer`s when the parser fails to\n  translate its credentials to Kong configuration, instead of logging thet\n  error to reduce the redundant logs.\n  [#4398](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4398)\n- `Gateway` can now correctly update `AttachedRoutes` even if there are more\n  than 100 `HttpRoute`s.\n  [#4458](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4458)\n\n[gojson]: https://github.com/goccy/go-json\n[httproute-specification]: https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.HTTPRoute\n[grpcroute-specification]:  https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2.GRPCRouteRule\n\n## [2.10.5]\n\n> Release date: 2023-08-31\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed compatibility with Kong 3.3+ when using chart versions 2.26+.\n  [#4515](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4515)\n\n## [2.10.4]\n\n> Release date: 2023-07-25\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a bug that prevented the controller from updating configuration in\n  Konnect Runtime Groups API when an existing Certificate was updated.\n  [#4384](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4384)\n\n## [2.10.3]\n\n> Release date: 2023-07-13\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Nodes in Konnect Runtime Groups API are not updated every 3s anymore.\n  This was caused by a bug in `NodeAgent` that was sending the updates\n  despite the fact that the configuration status was not changed.\n  [#4324](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4324)\n\n## [2.10.2]\n\n> Release date: 2023-07-07\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `--update-status-queue-buffer-size` allowing configuring the size of\n  the status update queue's underlying channels used to buffer updates to the\n  status of Kubernetes resources.\n  [#4267](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4267)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Translator of `GRPCRoute` generates paths without leading `~` when running\n  with Kong gateway with version below 3.0.\n  [#4238](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4238)\n- Fixed a bug where the controller sync loop would get stuck when a number of\n  updates for one of Gateway API resources kinds (`HTTPRoute`, `TCPRoute`,\n  `UDPRoute`, `TLSRoute`, `GRPCRoute`) exceeded 8192. This was caused by the\n  fact that the controller was using a fixed-size buffer to store updates for\n  each resource kind and there were no consumers for the updates. The sending\n  was blocked after a buffer got full, resulting in a deadlock.\n  [#4267](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4267)\n\n## [2.10.1]\n\n> Release date: 2023-06-27\n\n### Added\n\n- `--konnect-initial-license-polling-period` and `--konnect-license-polling-period`\n  CLI flags were added to allow configuring periods at which KIC polls license\n  from Konnect. The initial period will be used until a valid license is retrieved.\n  The default values are 1m and 12h respectively.\n  [#4178](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4178)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix KIC crash which occurred when invalid config was applied in DB mode.\n  [#4213](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4213)\n\n## [2.10.0]\n\n> Release date: 2023-06-02\n\n### Added\n\n- Gateways now track UDP Listener status when `--publish-service-udp` is set.\n  `UDPRoute`s that do not match a valid UDP Listener are excluded from\n  configuration. Previously KIC added any UDPRoute that indicated an associated\n  Gateway as its parent regardless of Listener configuration or status.\n  [#3832](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3832)\n- Added license agent for Konnect-managed instances.\n  [#3883](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3883)\n- `Service`, `Route`, and `Consumer` Kong entities now can get assigned\n  deterministic IDs based on their unique properties (name, username, etc.)\n  instead of random UUIDs. To enable this feature, set `FillIDs` feature gate\n  to `true`.\n  It's going to be useful in cases where stable IDs are needed across multiple\n  Kong Gateways managed by KIC (e.g. for the integration with Konnect and\n  reporting metrics that later can be aggregated across multiple instances based\n  on the entity's ID).\n  When `FillIDs` will be enabled, the controller will re-create all the existing\n  entities (Services, Routes, and Consumers) with the new IDs assigned. That can\n  potentially lead to temporary downtime between the deletion of the old entities\n  and the creation of the new ones.\n  Users should be cautious about enabling the feature if their existing DB-backed\n  setup consists of a huge amount of entities for which the recreation can take\n  significant time.\n  [#3933](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3933)\n  [#4075](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4075)\n- Added translator to translate ingresses under `networking.k8s.io/v1` to\n  expression based Kong routes. The translator is enabled when feature gate\n  `ExpressionRoutes` is turned on and the managed Kong gateway runs in router\n  flavor `expressions`. We assume `router_flavor` to be `traditional`\n  for versions below 3.0. If it is not available in Kong's configuration,\n  for versions 3.0 and above, abort with an error.\n  [#3935](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3935)\n  [#4076](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4076)\n- Added `CombinedServices` feature gate that prevents the controller from\n  creating a separate Kong `Service` for each `netv1.Ingress` that uses\n  the same Kubernetes `Service` as its backend when `CombinedRoutes` feature\n  is turned on. Instead, the controller will create a single Kong `Service`\n  in such circumstances.\n  The feature is disabled by default to allow users to adapt to the changed\n  Kong Services naming scheme (`<namespace>.<service-name>.<port>` instead\n  of `<namespace>.<ingress-name>.<service-name>.<port>`) - it could break\n  existing monitoring rules that rely on the old naming scheme.\n  It will become the default behavior in the next minor release with the possibility\n  to opt-out.\n  [#3963](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3963)\n- Added translator to translate `HTTPRoute` and `GRPCRoute` in gateway APIs to\n  expression based kong routes. Similar to ingresses, this translator is only\n  enabled when feature gate `ExpressionRoutes` is turned on and the managed\n  Kong gateway runs in router flavor `expressions`.\n  [#3956](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3956)\n  [#3988](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3988)\n- Configuration updates to Konnect Runtime Group's Admin API now respect a backoff\n  strategy that prevents KIC from exceeding API calls limits.\n  [#3989](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3989)\n  [#4015](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4015)\n- When Gateway API CRDs are not installed, the controllers of those are not started\n  during the start-up phase. From now on, they will be dynamically started in runtime\n  once their installation is detected, making restarting the process unnecessary.\n  [#3996](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3996)\n- Disable translation of unsupported Kubernetes objects when translating to\n  expression based routes is enabled (`ExpressionRoutes` feature enabled AND\n  kong using router flavor `expressions`), and generate a translation failure\n  event attached to each of the unsupported objects.\n  [#4022](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4022)\n- Controller's configuration synchronization status reported to Konnect's Node API\n  now accounts for potential failures in synchronizing configuration with Konnect's\n  Runtime Group Admin API.\n  [#4029](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4029)\n- Record an event attached to KIC pod after applying configuration to Kong. If\n  the applying succeeded, a `Normal` event with `KongConfigurationSucceeded`\n  reason is recorded. If the applying failed, a `Warning` event with\n  `KongConfigurationApplyFailed` reason is recorded.\n  [#4054](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4054)\n- Disable translation to expression routes when feature gate `ExpressionRoutes`\n  is enabled but feature gate `CombinedRoutes` is not enabled.\n  [#4057](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4057)\n- Added `--gateway-discovery-dns-strategy` flag which allows specifying which\n  DNS strategy to use when generating Gateway's Admin API addresses.\n  [#4071](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4071)\n\n  There are 3 options available\n  - `ip` (default): which will make KIC create Admin API addresses built out of\n    IP addresses.\n  - `pod`: will make KIC build addresses using the following template:\n    `pod-ip-address.my-namespace.pod`.\n  - `service`: will make KIC build addresses using the following template:\n    `pod-ip-address.service-name.my-namespace.svc`.\n    This is known to not work on GKE because it uses `kube-dns` instead of `coredns`.\n- Gateway's `AttachedRoutes` fields get updated with the number of routes referencing\n  and using each listener.\n  [#4052](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4052)\n- `all-in-one-postgres.yaml` and `all-in-one-postgres-enterprise.yaml` manifests'\n  migrations job now works properly when running against an already bootstrapped\n  database, allowing upgrades from one version of Kong Gateway to another without\n  tearing down the database.\n  [#4116](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4116)\n- Telemetry reports now include a count for every `gateway.networking.k8s.io` CRD.\n  [#4058](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4058)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Kong Ingress Controller no longer relies on `k8s.io.api.core.v1` `Endpoints`,\n  and instead uses `discovery.k8s.io/v1` `EndpointSlice` to discover endpoints\n  for Kubernetes `Service`s.\n  [#3997](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3997)\n- Gateway Discovery now produces DNS names instead of IP addresses\n  [#4044](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/4044)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed paging in `GetAdminAPIsForService` which might have caused the controller\n  to only return the head of the list of Endpoints for Admin API service.\n  [#3846](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3846)\n- Fixed a race condition in the version-specific feature system.\n  [#3852](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3852)\n- Fixed a missing reconciliation behavior for Admin API `EndpointSlice` reconciler\n  when the `EndpointSlice` that we receive a reconciliation request for is already\n  missing\n  [#3889](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3889)\n- Fixed leader election role manifest where `\"\"` and `\"coordination\"` API groups\n  together with the related manifest resources (`configmaps` and `leases`) might\n  become mixed up when the manifest is unmarshalled.\n  [#3932](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3932)\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- Removed support for `extensions/v1beta1` `Ingress` which was removed in kubernetes 1.22.\n  At the same time deprecate `--enable-controller-ingress-extensionsv1beta1` CLI flag.\n  [#3710](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3710)\n\n- Removed support for `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` `Ingress` which was removed in kubernetes 1.22.\n  At the same time deprecate `--enable-controller-ingress-networkingv1beta1` CLI flag.\n  [#3867](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3867)\n\n## [2.9.3]\n\n> Release date: 2023-04-17\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a missing reconciliation behavior for Admin API EndpointSlice reconciler\n  when the EndpointSlice that we receive a reconciliation request for is already\n  missing\n  [#3889](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3889)\n- Update enterprise manifests to use Kong Gateway 3.2\n  [#3885](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3885)\n\n## [2.9.2]\n\n> Release date: 2023-04-03\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a deadlock in `AdminAPIClientsManager` which could occur when Konnect integration\n  was enabled, and multiple `Notify` calls were made in parallel (e.g. when scaling Gateway\n  deployment up).\n  [#3816](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3816)\n\n## [2.9.1]\n\n> Release date: 2023-03-29\n\nThis release was intended to include a fix for a deadlock in `AdminAPIClientsManager`\n([#3816](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3816)), but it wasn't\nbackported properly. It is included in the next patch release.\n\n## [2.9.0]\n\n> Release date: 2023-03-27\n\n### Added\n\n- Konnect Runtime Group's nodes are reactively updated on each discovered Gateway clients\n  change.\n  [#3727](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3727)\n- Telemetry reports now include a number of discovered Gateways when the Gateway Discovery\n  feature is turned on.\n  [#3783](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3783)\n- Adding the `konghq.com/tags: csv,of,tags` annotation will add tags to\n  generated resources.\n  [#3778](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3778)\n- `HTTPRoute` reconciler now watches relevant `ReferenceGrant`s for changes.\n  [#3759](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3759)\n- Bumped Kong version in manifests to 3.2.\n  [#3804](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3804)\n- Store status of whether configuration succeeded or failed for Kubernetes\n  objects in dataplane client and publish the events to let controllers know\n  if the controlled objects succeeded or failed to be translated to Kong\n  configuration.\n  [#3359](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3359)\n- Added `version` command\n  [#3379](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3379)  \n- Added `--publish-service-udp` to indicate the Service that handles inbound\n  UDP traffic.\n  [#3325](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3325)\n- Added possibility to configure multiple Kong Gateways through the\n  `--kong-admin-url` CLI flag (which can be specified multiple times) or through\n  a corresponding environment variable `CONTROLLER_KONG_ADMIN_URL` (which can\n  specify multiple values separated by a comma).\n  [#3268](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3268)\n- Added a new `dbless-konnect` configuration variant to the manifests. It can\n  be used to deploy a DB-less variant of KIC that will also synchronise its\n  data-plane configuration with Konnect cloud.\n  [#3448](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3448)\n- The Gateway API has been bumped to 0.6.1. The `GatewayConditionScheduled` has\n  been replaced by the `GatewayConditionAccepted`, and the `ListenerConditionDetached`\n  condition has been replaced by the `ListenerConditionAccepted`.\n  [#3496](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3496)\n  [#3524](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3524)\n- The `ReferenceGrant` has been promoted to beta.\n  [#3507](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3507)\n- Enable `ReferenceGrant` if `Gateway` feature gate is turned on (default).\n  [#3519](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3519)\n- Experimental `--konnect-sync-enabled` feature flag has been introduced. It\n  enables the integration with Kong's Konnect cloud. It's turned off by default.\n  When enabled, it allows to synchronise data-plane configuration with\n  a Konnect Runtime Group specified by `--konnect-runtime-group-id`.\n  It requires `--konnect-tls-client-*` set of flags to be set to provide\n  Runtime Group's TLS client certificates for authentication.\n  [#3455](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3455)\n- Added Konnect client to upload status of KIC instance to Konnect cloud if\n  flag `--konnect-sync-enabled` is set to `true`.\n  [#3469](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3469)\n- Added Gateway discovery using Kong Admin API service configured via `--kong-admin-svc`\n  which accepts a namespaced name of a headless service which should have\n  Admin API endpoints exposed under a named port called `admin`. Gateway \n  discovery is only allowed to run with dbless kong gateways.\n  [#3421](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3421)\n  [#3642](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3642)\n- Added configurable port names for Gateway discovery through\n  `--kong-admin-svc-port-names`. This flag accepts a list of port names that\n  Admin API service ports will be matched against.\n  [#3556](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3556)\n- Added `dataplane` metrics label for `ingress_controller_configuration_push_count`\n  and `ingress_controller_configuration_push_duration_milliseconds`. This means\n  that all time series for those metrics will get a new label designating the\n  address of the dataplane that the configuration push has been targeted for.\n  [#3521](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3521)\n- In DB-less mode, failure to push a config will now generate Kubernetes Events\n  with the reason `KongConfigurationApplyFailed` and an `InvolvedObject`\n  indicating which Kubernetes resource was responsible for the broken Kong\n  configuration.\n  [#3446](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3446)\n- Leader election is enabled by default when Kong Gateway discovery is enabled.\n  [#3529](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3529)\n- Added flag `--konnect-refresh-node-period` to set the period of uploading \n  status of KIC instance to Konnect runtime group.\n  [#3533](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3533)\n- Replaced service account's token static secret with a projected volume in \n  deployment manifests.\n  [#3563](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3563)\n- Added `GRPCRoute` controller and implemented basic `GRPCRoute` functionality.\n  [#3537](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3537)\n- Included Konnect sync and Gateway discovery features in telemetry reports.\n  [#3588](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3588)\n- Upload the status of controlled Kong gateway nodes to Konnect when syncing with \n  Konnect is enabled by setting the flag `--konnect-sync-enabled` to true. \n  If gateway discovery is enabled via `--kong-admin-svc` flag, the hostname of a node \n  corresponding to each Kong gateway instance will use `<pod_namespace>/<pod_name>` \n  format, where `pod_namespace` and `pod_name` are the namespace and name of the Kong \n  gateway pod. If gateway discovery is disabled, the Kong gateway nodes will use `gateway_<address>` \n  as the hostname, where `address` is the Admin API address used by KIC.\n  [#3587](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3587)\n- All all-in-one DB-less deployment manifests will now use separate deployments \n  for the controller and the proxy. This enables the proxy to be scaled independently\n  of the controller. The old `all-in-one-dbless.yaml` manifest has been deprecated and \n  renamed to `all-in-one-dbless-legacy.yaml`. It will be removed in a future release.\n  [#3629](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3629)\n- The RequestRedirect Gateway API filter is now supported and translated\n  to the proper set of Kong plugins.\n  [#3702](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3702)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the issue where the status of an ingress is not updated when `secretName` is\n  not specified in `ingress.spec.tls`.\n  [#3719](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3719)\n- Fixed incorrectly set parent status for Gateway API routes\n  [#3732](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3732)\n- Disabled non-functioning mesh reporting when `--watch-namespaces` flag set.\n  [#3336](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3336)\n- Fixed the duplicate update of status of `HTTPRoute` caused by incorrect check\n  of whether status is changed.\n  [#3346](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3346)\n- Change existing `resolvedRefs` condition in status `HTTPRoute` if there is\n  already one to avoid multiple appearance of conditions with same type\n  [#3386](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3386)\n- Event messages for invalid multi-Service backends now indicate their derived\n  Kong resource name.\n  [#3318](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3318)\n- Removed a duplicated status update of the HTTPRoute, which led to a potential\n  status flickering.\n  [#3451](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3451)\n- Made Admission Webhook fetch the latest list of Gateways to avoid calling\n  outdated services set statically during the setup.\n  [#3601](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3601)\n- Fixed the way configuration flags `KongAdminSvc` and `PublishService` are\n  checked for being set. The old one was always evaluating to `true`.\n  [#3602](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3602)\n\n### Under the hood\n\n- Controller manager scheme is constructed based on the provided feature gates\n  [#3539](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3539)\n- Updated the compiler to [Go v1.20](https://golang.org/doc/go1.20)\n  [#3540](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/3540)\n- Fixed an issue with the fake clientset using the wrong group name\n  [#3517](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/3517)\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- `kong-custom-entities-secret` flag has been marked as deprecated and will be\n  removed in 3.0.\n  [#3262](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3262)\n\n## [2.8.2]\n\n> Release date: 2022-03-30\n\n### Under the hood\n\n- Updated Golang from 1.19.4 to 1.20.1 to address several CVEs.\n  [#3775](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3775)\n\n\n## [2.8.1]\n\n> Release date: 2022-01-04\n\n### Fixed\n\n- When `CombinedRoutes` is turned on, translator will replace each occurrence of\n  `*` in `Ingress`'s host to `_` in kong route names because `*` is not\n  allowed in kong route names.\n  [#3312](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3312)\n- Fix an issue with `CombinedRoutes`, which caused the controller to fail when\n  creating config for Ingress when backend services specified only port names\n  [#3313](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3313)\n- Parse `ttl` field of key-auth credentials in secrets to `int` type before filling\n  to kong credentials to fix the invalid type error.\n  [#3319](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3319)\n\n## [2.8.0]\n\n> Release date: 2022-12-19\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- The `CombinedRoutes` feature flag is enabled by default, and traditional\n  route generation is deprecated. This reduces configuration size without\n  affecting routing, but does change route names and IDs. Metrics\n  monitors or other systems that track data by route name or ID will see a\n  break in continuity. The [feature gates document](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/FEATURE_GATES.md#differences-between-traditional-and-combined-routes)\n  covers changes in greater detail. Please [comment on the deprecation\n  issue](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/3131)\n  if you have questions or concerns about the transition.\n  [#3132](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3132)\n\n### Known issues\n\n- Processing of custom entities through `--kong-custom-entities-secret` flag or\n  `CONTROLLER_KONG_CUSTOM_ENTITIES_SECRET` environment variable does not work.\n  [#3278](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/3278)\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- KongIngress' `proxy` and `route` fields are now deprecated in favor of\n  Service and Ingress annotations. The annotations will become the only\n  means of configuring those settings in 3.0 release.\n  [#3246](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3246)\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `HTTPRoute` support for `CombinedRoutes` feature. When enabled,\n  `HTTPRoute.HTTPRouteRule` objects with identical `backendRefs` generate a \n  single Kong service instead of a service per rule, and \n  `HTTPRouteRule.HTTPRouteMatche` objects using the same `backendRefs` can be \n  consolidated into a single Kong route instead of always creating a route per \n  match, reducing configuration size.\n  The following limitations apply:\n  - `HTTPRouteRule` objects cannot be consolidated into a single Kong Service \n    if they belong to different `HTTPRoute`.\n  - `HTTPRouteRule` objects cannot be consolidated into a single Kong Service \n    if they have different `HTTPRouteRule.HTTPBackendRef[]` objects. The order\n    of the backend references is not important.\n  - `HTTPRouteMatch` objects cannot be consolidated into a single Kong Route\n    if parent `HTTPRouteRule` objects cannot be consolidated into a single Kong Service.\n  - `HTTPRouteMatch` objects cannot be consolidated into a single Kong Route\n    if parent `HTTPRouteRule` objects have different `HTTPRouteRule.HTTPRouteFilter[]` filters.\n  - `HTTPRouteMatch` objects cannot be consolidated into a single Kong Route \n    if they have different matching spec (`HTTPHeaderMatch.Headers`, `HTTPHeaderMatch.QueryParams`, \n    `HTTPHeaderMatch.Method`). Different `HTTPHeaderMatch.Path` paths between \n    `HTTPRouteMatch[]` objects does not prevent consolidation.\n  This change does not functionally impact routing: requests that went to a given Service\n  using the original method still go to the same Service when `CombinedRoutes` is enabled.\n  [#3008](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3008)\n  [#3060]https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3060)\n- Added `--cache-sync-timeout` flag allowing to change the default controllers' \n  cache synchronisation timeout. \n  [#3013](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3013)\n- Secrets validation introduced: CA certificates won't be synchronized\n  to Kong if the certificate is expired.\n  [#3063](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3063)\n- Changed the logic of storing secrets into object cache. Now only the secrets\n  that are possibly used in Kong configuration are stored into cache, and the \n  irrelevant secrets (e.g: service account tokens) are not stored. This change\n  is made to reduce memory usage of the cache.\n  [#3047](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3047)\n- Services support annotations for connect, read, and write timeouts.\n  [#3121](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3121)\n- Services support annotations for retries.\n  [#3121](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3121)\n- Routes support annotations for headers. These use a special\n  `konghq.com/headers.HEADERNAME` format. For example, adding\n  `konghq.com/headers.x-example: green` to an Ingress will create routes that\n  only match requests with an `x-example: green` request header.\n  [#3121](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3121)\n  [#3155](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3155)\n- Routes support annotations for path handling.\n  [#3121](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3121)\n- Warning Kubernetes API events with a `KongConfigurationTranslationFailed` \n  reason are recorded when:\n  - CA secrets cannot be properly translated into Kong configuration\n    [#3125](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3125)\n  - Annotations in services backing a single route do not match\n    [#3130](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3130)\n  - A service's referred client-cert does not exist.\n    [#3137](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3137)\n  - One of `netv1.Ingress` related issues occurs (e.g. backing Kubernetes service couldn't \n    be found, matching Kubernetes service port couldn't be found).\n    [#3138](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3138)\n  - A Gateway Listener has more than one CertificateRef specified or refers to a Secret \n    that has no valid TLS key-pair.\n    [#3147](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3147)\n  - An Ingress refers to a TLS secret that does not exist or\n    has no valid TLS key-pair.\n    [#3150](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3150)\n  - An HTTPRoute has no backendRefs specified.\n    [#3167](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3167)\n- CRDs' validations improvements: `UDPIngressRule.Port`, `IngressRule.Port` and `IngressBackend.ServiceName`\n  instead of being validated in the Parser, are validated by the Kubernetes API now.\n  [#3136](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3136)\n- Gateway API: Implement port matching for HTTPRoute, TCPRoute and TLSRoute as defined in\n  [GEP-957](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-957/)\n  [#3129](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3129)\n  [#3226](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3226)\n- Gateway API: Matching routes by `Listener.AllowedRoutes`\n  [#3181](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3181)\n- Admission webhook will warn if any of `KongIngress` deprecated fields gets populated.\n  [#3261](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3261)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- The controller now logs an error for and skips multi-Service rules that have\n  inconsistent Service annotations. Previously this issue prevented the\n  controller from applying configuration until corrected.\n  [#2988](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2988)\n- Gateway API has been updated to 0.5.1. That version brought in some changes\n  in the conformance tests logic. Now, when the TLS config of a listener\n  references a non-existing secret, the listener ResolvedRefs condition reason\n  is set to InvalidCertificateRef. In addition, if a TLS config references a\n  secret in another namespace, and no ReferenceGrant allows that\n  reference, the listener ResolvedRefs condition reason is set to\n  RefNotPermitted.\n  [#3024](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3024)\n- The `distroless` target is now the last target in the Dockerfile. This makes\n  it the default target if `docker buildx build` is invoked without a target.\n  While custom image build pipelines _should_ specify a target, this change\n  makes the default the same target released as the standard\n  `kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller:X.Y.Z` tags in the official repo.\n  [#3043](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3043)\n- The controller will no longer crash in case of missing CRDs installation.\n  Instead, an explicit message will be logged, informing that a given resource\n  controller has been disabled.\n  [#3013](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3013)\n- Improve signal handling and cancellation. With this change broken connection to\n  Admin API and/or initial data plane sync can be cancelled properly.\n  [#3076](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3076)\n- Admin and proxy listens in the deploy manifests now use the same parameters\n  as the default upstream kong.conf.\n  [#3165](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3165)\n- Fix the behavior of filtering hostnames in `HTTPRoute` when listeners \n  of parent gateways specified hostname.\n  If an `HTTPRoute` does not specify hostnames, and one of its parent listeners\n  has not specified hostname, the `HTTPRoute` matches any hostname. \n  If an `HTTPRoute` specifies hostnames, and no intersecting hostnames \n  could be found in its parent listners, it is not accepted.\n  [#3180](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3180)\n- Matches `sectionName` in parentRefs of route objects in gateway API. Now \n  if a route specifies `sectionName` in parentRefs, and no listener can \n  match the specified name, the route is not accepted.\n  [#3230](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3230)\n- If there's no matching Kong listener for a protocol specified in a Gateway's\n  Listener, only one `Detached` condition is created in the Listener's status.\n  [#3257](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3257)\n\n## [2.7.0]\n\n> Release date: 2022-09-26\n\n2.7 patches several bugs in 2.6.0. One of these required a breaking change. The\nbreaking change is not expected to affect most configurations, but does require\na minor version bump to comply with semver. If you have not already upgraded to\n2.6, you should upgrade directly from 2.5 to 2.7, and follow the 2.6 upgrade\ninstructions and the [revised Kong 3.x upgrade instructions](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/2.7.x/guides/upgrade-kong-3x).\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Ingress paths that begin with `/~` are now treated as regular expressions,\n  and are translated into a Kong route path that begins with `~` instead of\n  `/~`. To preserve the existing translation, set `konghq.com/regex-prefix` to\n  some value. For example, if you set `konghq.com/regex-prefix: /@`, paths\n  beginning with `/~` will result in route paths beginning in `/~`, whereas\n  paths beginning in `/@` will result in route paths beginning in `~`.\n  [#2956](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2956)\n\n### Added\n\n- The controller-specific `/~` prefix translates to the Kong `~` prefix, as\n  Ingress does not allow paths that do not begin in `/`. The prefix can be\n  overriden by setting a `konghq.com/regex-prefix` annotation, for routes that\n  need their paths to actually begin with `/~`\n  [#2956](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2956)\n- Prometheus metrics now highlight configuration push failures caused by\n  conflicts. The `ingress_controller_configuration_push_count` Prometheus\n  metric now reports `success=\"false\"` with a `failure_reason=\"conflict|other\"`\n  label, distinguishing configuration conflicts from other errors (transient\n  network errors, Kong offline, Kong reported non-conflict error, etc.).\n  [#2965](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2965)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- The legacy regex heuristic toggle on IngressClassParameters now works when\n  the combined routes feature flag is enabled.\n  [#2942](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2942)\n- Handles Kubernetes versions that do not support namespaced\n  IngressClassParameters without panicking. Although the controller will run on\n  clusters without the `IngressClassNamespacedParams` feature gate enabled\n  (1.21) or without it available (<1.21), these clusters do not support the\n  legacy regular expression heuristic IngressClassParameters option. These\n  versions are EOL, and we advise users to upgrade to Kubernetes 1.22 or later\n  before upgrading to KIC 2.6+ or Kong 3.0+.\n  [#2970](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2970)\n\n## [2.6.0]\n\n> Release date: 2022-09-14\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Kong 3.x changes regular expression configuration and the controller does not\n  handle these changes automatically. You will need to enable compatibility\n  features initially and then update Ingress configuration before disabling\n  them. This procedure is covered in the [Kong 3.x upgrade guide for the\n  controller](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/2.6.x/guides/upgrade-kong-3x).\n- When using the `CombinedRoutes=true` feature gate, Ingress rules with no\n  PathType now use ImplementationSpecific instead of Prefix. While Kong's\n  ImplementationSpecific handling is similar to Prefix, it does not require\n  that the prefix be a directory: an ImplementationSpecific `/foo` will match\n  `/foo`, `/foo/`, and `/foo/.*`, whereas Prefix will only match the latter\n  two. If you have rules with no PathType, use `CombinedRoutes=true`, and wish\n  to preserve existing behavior, add `PathType=prefix` configuration to those\n  rules.\n  [#2883](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2883)\n- The GatewayClass objects now require the annotation\n  \"konghq.com/gatewayclass-unmanaged\" to be reconciled by the controller.\n  The annotation \"konghq.com/gateway-unmanaged\" is not considered anymore and\n  doesn't need to be set on Gateways to be reconciled. Only the Gateways using\n  an unmanaged GatewayClass are reconciled.\n  [#2917](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2917)\n\n#### Added\n\n- IngressClassParameters now supports a `enableLegacyRegexDetection` boolean\n  field. Kong 3.x+ requires adding a `~` prefix to regular expression paths,\n  whereas Kong 2.x and earlier attempted to detect regular expression paths\n  using heuristics. By default, if you use regular expression paths and wish to\n  migrate to Kong 3.x, you must update all Ingresses to use this prefix.\n  Enabling this field will use the 2.x heuristic to detect if an Ingress path\n  is a regular expression and add the prefix for you. You should update your\n  Ingresses to include the new prefix as soon as possible after upgrading to\n  Kong 3.x+, however, as the heuristic has known flaws that will not be fixed.\n  [#2883](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2883)\n- Added support for plugin ordering (requires Kong Enterprise 3.0 or higher).\n  [#2657](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2657)\n- The all-in-one manifests now use a separate ClusterRole for Gateway API\n  resources, allowing non-admin users to apply these manifests (minus the\n  Gateway API role) on clusters without Gateway API CRDs installed.\n  [#2529](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2529)\n- Gateway API support which had previously been off by default behind a feature\n  gate (`--feature-gates=Gateway=true`) is now **on by default** and covers beta\n  stage APIs (`GatewayClass`, `Gateway`, and `HTTPRoute`). Alpha stage APIs\n  (`TCPRoute`, `UDPRoute`, `TLSRoute`, `ReferenceGrant`) have been moved behind\n  a different feature gate called `GatewayAlpha` and are off by default. When\n  upgrading if you're using the alpha APIs, switch your feature gate flags to\n  `--feature-gates=GatewayAlpha=true` to keep them enabled.\n  [#2781](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2781)\n- Added all the Gateway-related conformance tests.\n  [#2777](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2777)\n- Added all the HTTPRoute-related conformance tests.\n  [#2776](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2776)\n- Added support for Kong 3.0 upstream `query_arg` and `uri_capture` hash\n  configuration to KongIngress.\n  [#2822](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2822)\n- Added support for Gateway API's `v1beta1` versions of: `GatewayClass`, `Gateway`\n  and `HTTPRoute`.\n  [#2889](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2889)\n  [#2894](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2894)\n  [#2900](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2900)\n- Manifests now use `/bin/bash` instead of `/bin/sh` and use bash-based\n  connectivity checks for compatibility with the new Debian Kong images.\n  [#2923](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2923)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- When `Endpoints` could not be found for a `Service` to add them as targets of\n  a Kong `Upstream`, this would produce a log message at `error` and `warning`\n  levels which was inaccurate because this condition is often expected when\n  `Pods` are being provisioned. Those log entries now report at `info` level.\n  [#2820](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2820)\n  [#2825](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2825)\n- Added `mtls-auth` to the admission webhook supported credential types list.\n  [#2739](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2739)\n- Disabled additional IngressClass lookups in other reconcilers when the\n  IngressClass reconciler is disabled.\n  [#2724](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2724)\n- ReferencePolicy support has been dropped in favor of the newer ReferenceGrant API.\n  [#2775](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2772)\n- Fixed a bug that caused the `Knative` feature gate to not be checked. Since our\n  knative integration is on by default and because it gets very little usage\n  this likely did not cause any troubles for anyone as all fixing this will do\n  is make it possible to disable the knative controller using the feature gate.\n  (it is also possible to control it via the `--enable-controller-knativeingress`\n  which was working properly).\n  [#2781](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2781)\n- Treat status conditions in `Gateway` and `GatewayClass` as snapshots, replace\n  existing conditions with same type on setting conditions.\n  [#2791](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2791)\n- Update Listener statuses whenever they change, not just on Gateway creation.\n  [#2797](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2797)\n- StripPath for `HTTPRoute`s is now disabled by default to be conformant with the\n  Gateway API requirements.\n  #[#2737](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2737)\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Updated the compiler to [Go v1.19](https://golang.org/doc/go1.19)\n  [#2794](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2794)\n\n## [2.5.0]\n\n> Release date: 2022-07-11\n\n#### Breaking changes in Gateway API technical preview:\n\n- The controller no longer overrides Gateway Listeners with a list of Listeners\n  derived from Kong configuration. User-provided Listener lists are preserved\n  as-is. Listener status information indicates if a requested Listener is not\n  ready because of missing Kong listen configuration. This is necessary to\n  properly support allowed routes and TLS configuration in Listeners, which\n  would otherwise be wiped out by automatic updates. This has no immediate\n  impact on existing Gateway resources used with previous versions: their\n  automatically-set Listeners are now treated as user-defined Listeners and\n  will not be modified by upgrading. This only affects new Gateway resources:\n  you will need to populate the Listeners you want, and they will need to match\n  Kong's listen configuration to become ready.\n  [#2555](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2555)\n\n#### Added\n\n- Updated Gateway API dependencies to [v0.5.0][gw-v0.5.0] and updated `examples`\n  directory to use `v1beta1` versions of APIs where applicable.\n  [#2691](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2691)\n- Added support for Gateway Listener TLS configuration, to enable full use of\n  TLSRoute and HTTPS HTTPRoutes.\n  [#2580](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2580)\n- Added information about service mesh deployment and distribution in telemetry data reported to Kong.\n  [#2642](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2642)\n\n[gw-v0.5.0]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v0.5.0\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the problem that logs from reporter does not appear in the pod log.\n  [#2645](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2645)\n\n## [2.4.2]\n\n> Release date: 2022-06-30\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fix an issue with ServiceAccount token mount.\n  [#2620](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2620)\n  [#2626](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2626)\n\n## [2.4.1]\n\n> Release date: 2022-06-22\n\n#### Added\n\n- Increased the default Kong admin API timeout from 10s to 30s and added a\n  log mentioning the flag to increase it further.\n  [#2594](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2594)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Disabling the IngressClass controller now disables IngressClass watches in\n  other controllers. This fixes a crash on Kubernetes versions that do not\n  offer an IngressClass version that KIC can read.\n  [#2577](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2577)\n\n## [2.4.0]\n\n> Release date: 2022-06-14\n\n#### Added\n\n- A new gated feature called `CombinedRoutes` has been added. Historically\n  a `kong.Route` would be created for _each path_ on an `Ingress` resource\n  in the phase where Kubernetes resources are translated to Kong Admin API\n  configuration. This new feature changes how `Ingress` resources are\n  translated so that a single route can be created for any unique combination\n  of ingress object, hostname, service and port which has multiple paths.\n  This option is helpful for end-users who are making near constant changes\n  to their configs (e.g. constantly adding, updating, and removing `Ingress`\n  resources) at scale, and users that have enormous numbers of paths all\n  pointing to a single Kubernetes `Service` as it can significantly reduce\n  the overall size of the dataplane configuration that is pushed to the Kong\n  Admin API. This feature is expected to be disruptive (routes may be dropped\n  briefly in postgres mode when switching to this mode) so for the moment it\n  is behind a feature gate while we continue to iterate on it and evaluate it\n  and seek a point where it would become the default behavior. Enable it with\n  the controller argument `--feature-gates=CombinedRoutes`.\n  [#2490](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2490)\n- `UDPRoute` resources now support multiple backendRefs for load-balancing.\n  [#2405](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2405)\n- `TCPRoute` resources now support multiple backendRefs for load-balancing.\n  [#2405](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2405)\n- `TCPRoute` resources are now supported.\n  [#2086](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2086)\n- `HTTPRoute` resources now support multiple `backendRefs` with a round-robin\n  load-balancing strategy applied by default across the `Endpoints` or the\n  `Services` (if the `ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream`\n  annotation is set). They also now support weights to enable more\n  fine-tuning of the load-balancing between those backend services.\n  [#2166](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2166)\n- `Gateway` resources now honor [`listener.allowedRoutes.namespaces`\n  filters](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2.RouteNamespaces).\n  Note that the unmanaged Kong Gateway implementation populates listeners\n  automatically based on the Kong Service and Deployment, and user-provided\n  `allowedRoutes` filters are merged into generated listeners with the same\n  protocol.\n  [#2389](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2389)\n- Added `--skip-ca-certificates` flag to ignore CA certificate resources for\n  [use with multi-workspace environments](https://github.com/Kong/deck/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v1120).\n  [#2341](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2341)\n- Gateway API Route types now support cross-namespace BackendRefs if a\n  [ReferencePolicy](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/api-types/referencepolicy/)\n  permits them.\n  [#2451](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2451)\n- Added description of each field of `kongIngresses` CRD.\n  [#1766](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1766)\n- Added support for `TLSRoute` resources.\n  [#2476](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2476)\n- Added `--term-delay` flag to support setting a time delay before processing\n  `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals. This was added to specifically help in\n  situations where the Kong Gateway has a load-balancer in front of it to help\n  stagger and stabilize the shutdown procedure when the load-balancer is\n  draining or otherwise needs to remove the Gateway from it's rotation.\n  [#2494](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2494)\n- Added `kong-ingress-controller` category to CRDs\n  [#2517](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2517)\n- Added `v1alpha1.IngressClassParameters` CRD and its first field `ServiceUpstream`\n  to control the behavior of routing traffic via an upstream service for all services managed\n  by an ingress class without the need of adding an annotation to every single one\n  [#2535](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2535)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Unmanaged-mode `Gateway` resources which reference a `LoadBalancer` type\n  `Service` will now tolerate the IPs/Hosts for that `Service` not becoming\n  provisioned (e.g. the `LoadBalancer` implementation is broken or otherwise\n  and the `EXTERNAL-IP` is stuck in `<pending>`) and will still attempt to\n  configure `Routes` for that `Gateway` as long as the dataplane API can be\n  otherwise reached.\n  [#2413](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2413)\n- Fixed a race condition in the newer Gateway route controllers which could\n  trigger when an object's status was updated shortly after the object was\n  cached in the dataplane client.\n  [#2446](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2446)\n- Added a mechanism to retry the initial connection to the Kong\n  Admin API on controller start to fix an issue where the controller\n  pod could crash loop on start when waiting for Gateway readiness \n  (e.g. if the Gateway is waiting for its database to initialize). \n  The new retry mechanism can be manually configured using the \n  `--kong-admin-init-retries` and `--kong-admin-init-retry-delay` flags.\n  [#2274](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2274)\n- diff logging now honors log level instead of printing at all log levels. It\n  will only print at levels `debug` and `trace`.\n  [#2422](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2422)\n- For KNative Ingress resources, KIC now reads both the new style annotation\n  `networking.knative.dev/ingress-class` and the deprecated `networking.knative.dev/ingress.class` one\n  to adapt to [what has already been done in knative](https://github.com/knative/networking/pull/522).\n  [#2485](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2485)\n- Remove KongIngress support for Gateway API Route objects and Services referenced\n  by those Routes. This disables an undocumented ability of customizing Gateway API\n  `*Route` objects and `Service`s that are set as backendRefs for those `*Route`s\n  via `konghq.com/override` annotations.\n  [#2554](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2554)\n- Fixed a vulnerability that permission could be escalated by running custom lua\n  scripts.\n  [#2572](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2572)\n\n## [2.3.1]\n\n> Release date: 2022-04-07\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where admission controllers configured without certificates\n  would incorrectly detect invalid configuration and prevent the controller\n  from starting.\n  [#2403](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2403)\n\n## [2.3.0]\n\n> Release date: 2022-04-05\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- HTTPRoute header matches no longer interpret CSV values as multiple match\n  values, as this was not part of the HTTPRoute specification. Multiple values\n  should use regular expressions instead.\n  [#2302](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2302)\n\n#### Added\n\n- `Gateway` resources which have a `LoadBalancer` address among their list of\n  addresses will have those addresses listed on the top for convenience, and\n  so that those addresses are made prominent in the `kubectl get gateways`\n  short view.\n  [#2339](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2339)\n- The controller manager can now be flagged with a client certificate to use\n  for mTLS authentication with the Kong Admin API.\n  [#1958](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1958)\n- Deployment manifests now include an IngressClass resource and permissions to\n  read IngressClass resources.\n  [#2292](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2292)\n- The controller now reads IngressClass resources to determine if its\n  IngressClass is the default IngressClass. If so, the controller will ingest\n  resources that require a class (Ingress, KongConsumer, KongClusterPlugin,\n  etc.) but have none set.\n  [#2313](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2313)\n- HTTPRoute header matches now support regular expressions.\n  [#2302](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2302)\n- HTTPRoutes that define multiple matches for the same header are rejected to\n  comply with the HTTPRoute specification.\n  [#2302](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2302)\n- Admission webhook certificate files now track updates to the file, and will\n  update when the corresponding Secret has changed.\n  [#2258](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2258)\n- Added support for Gateway API [UDPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2.UDPRoute)\n  resources.\n  [#2363](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2363)\n- The controller can now detect whether a Kong container has crashed and needs\n  a configuration push. Requires Kong 2.8+.\n  [#2343](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2343)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where duplicated route names in `HTTPRoute` resources with\n  multiple matches would cause the Kong Admin API to collide the routes into\n  one, effectively dropping routes for services beyond the first.\n  [#2345](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2345)\n- Status updates for `HTTPRoute` objects no longer mark the resource as\n  `ConditionRouteAccepted` until the object has been successfully configured\n  in Kong Gateway at least once, as long as `--update-status`\n  is enabled (enabled by default).\n  [#2339](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2339)\n- Status updates for `HTTPRoute` now properly use the `ConditionRouteAccepted`\n  value for parent `Gateway` conditions when the route becomes configured in\n  the `Gateway` rather than the previous random `\"attached\"` string.\n  [#2339](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2339)\n- Fixed a minor issue where addresses on `Gateway` resources would be\n  duplicated depending on how many listeners are configured.\n  [#2339](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2339)\n- Unconfigured fields now use their default value according to the Kong proxy\n  instance's reported schema. This addresses an issue where configuration\n  updates would send unnecessary requests to clear a default value.\n  [#2286](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2286)\n- Certificate selection for hostnames is no longer random if both certificate\n  Secrets have the same creation timestamp, and no longer results in\n  unnecessary configuration updates.\n  [#2338](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2338)\n\n## [2.2.1]\n\n> Release date: 2022/02/15\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Added mitigation for an issue where controllers may briefly delete and\n  recreate configuration upon gaining leadership while populating their\n  Kubernetes object cache.\n  [#2255](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2255)\n\n## [2.2.0]\n\n> Release date: 2022/02/04\n\n#### Added\n\n- Support for Kubernetes [Gateway APIs][gwapis] is now available [by enabling \n  the `Gateway` feature gate](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/2.2.x/guides/using-gateway-api/).\n  This is an alpha feature, with limited support for the `HTTPRoute` API.\n  [Gateway Milestone 1][gwm1]\n- Kubernetes client rate limiting can now be configured using `--apiserver-qps`\n  (default 100) and `--apiserver-burst` (default 300) settings. Defaults have\n  been increased to prevent ratelimiting under normal loads.\n  [#2169](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2169)\n- The KIC Grafana dashboard [is now published on grafana.com](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15662).\n  [#2235](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2235)\n\n[gwapis]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api\n[gwm1]:https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/milestone/21\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where validation could fail for credentials secrets if the\n  `value` for a unique constrained `key` were updated in place while linked\n  to a managed `KongConsumer`.\n  [#2190](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2190)\n- The controller now retries status updates if the publish service LoadBalancer\n  has not yet provisioned. This fixes an issue where controllers would not\n  update status until the first configuration change after the LoadBalancer\n  became ready.\n\n## [2.1.1]\n\n> Release date: 2022/01/05\n\n2.1.1 has no user-facing changes from 2.1.0. It updates a certificate used in\nthe test environment which expired during the 2.1.0 release process.\n[#2133](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2133)\n\n## [2.1.0]\n\n> Release date: 2022/01/05\n\n**Note:** the admission webhook updates originally released in [2.0.6](#206)\nare _not_ applied automatically by the upgrade. If you set one up previously,\nyou should edit it (`kubectl edit validatingwebhookconfiguration\nkong-validations`) and add `kongclusterplugins` under the `resources` block for\nthe `configuration.konghq.com` API group.\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- The `--leader-elect` flag has been deprectated and will be removed in a\n  future release. Leader election is now enabled or disabled automatically\n  based on the database mode. The flag is no longer honored.\n  [#2053](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2053)\n- You must upgrade to 2.0.x before upgrading to 2.1.x to properly handle the\n  transition from apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1 CRDs to apiextensions.k8s.io/v1\n  CRDSs. CRDs are now generated from their underlying Go structures to avoid\n  accidental mismatches between implementation and Kubernetes configuration.\n  KongIngresses previously included `healthchecks.passive.unhealthy.timeout`\n  and `healthchecks.active.unhealthy.timeout` fields that did not match the\n  corresponding Kong configuration and had no effect. These are now\n  `healthchecks.passive.unhealthy.timeouts` and\n  `healthchecks.active.unhealthy.timeouts`, respectively. If you use these\n  fields, you must rename them in your KongIngresses before upgrading.\n  [#1971](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1971)\n\n#### Added\n\n- Added validation for `Gateway` objects in the admission webhook\n  [#1946](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1946)\n- [Feature Gates][k8s-fg] have been added to the controller manager in order to\n  enable alpha/beta/experimental features and provide documentation about those\n  features and their maturity over time. For more information see the\n  [KIC Feature Gates Documentation][kic-fg].\n  [#1970](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1970)\n- a Gateway controller has been added in support of [Gateway APIs][gwapi].\n  This controller is foundational and doesn't serve any end-user purpose alone.\n  [#1945](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1945)\n- Anonymous reports now use TLS instead of UDP.\n  [#2089](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2089)\n- The new `--election-namespace` flag sets the leader election namespace. This\n  is normally only used if a controller is running outside a Kubernetes\n  cluster.\n  [#2053](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2053)\n- There is now a [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/grafana.json)\n  for the controller metrics.\n  [#2035](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2035)\n- TCPIngresses now support TLS passthrough in Kong 2.7+, by setting a\n  `konghq.com/protocols: tls_passthrough` annotation.\n  [#2041](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2041)\n\n[k8s-fg]:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\n[kic-fg]:https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/FEATURE_GATES.md\n[gwapi]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an edge case which could theoretically remove data-plane config for\n  objects which couldn't be retrieved from the manager's cached client.\n  [#2057](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2057)\n- The validating webhook now validates that required fields data are not empty.\n  [#1993](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1993)\n- The validating webhook now validates unique key constraints for KongConsumer\n  credentials secrets on update of secrets, and on create or update of\n  KongConsumers.\n  [#729](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/729)\n- Fixed a race condition where multiple actors may simultaneously attempt to\n  create the configured Enterprise workspaces.\n  [#2070](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2070)\n- Fixed incorrect leader election behavior. Previously, non-leader instances\n  would still attempt to update Kong configuration, but would not scan for\n  Kubernetes resources to translate into Kong configuration.\n  [#2053](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2053)\n- Configuration updates that time out now correctly report a failure.\n  [deck #529](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/529)\n  [#2125](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2125)\n\n## [2.0.7]\n\n> Release date: 2022/01/19\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Anonymous reports now use TLS instead of UDP.\n  [#2089](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2089)\n\n## [2.0.6]\n\n> Release date: 2021/11/19\n\n**Note:** the admission webhook updates are _not_ applied automatically by the\nupgrade. If you set one up previously, you should edit it (`kubectl edit\nvalidatingwebhookconfiguration kong-validations`) and add `kongclusterplugins`\nunder the `resources` block for the `configuration.konghq.com` API group.\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where statuses would not update properly when a single service\n  had multiple Ingress resources associated with it.\n  [#2013](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2013)\n- Fixed an issue where statuses would not update for Ingress resources with\n  periods in the name.\n  [#2012](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2012)\n- The template admission webhook configuration now includes KongClusterPlugins.\n  [#2000](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2000)\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Updated several Go dependencies. See `go.mod` in the [diff][2.0.6] for details.\n\n## [2.0.5]\n\n> Release date: 2021/11/02\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a bug where version reported for the controller manager was missing\n  due to incorrect linker flags and missing build args in image builds.\n  [#1943](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1943)\n- `hash_secret` strings in OAuth2 credentials now correctly convert to bools\n  in the generated Kong configuration.\n  [#1984](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1984)\n- Fixed an issue where the admission controller returned an incorrect\n  status code for invalid plugin configuration.\n  [#1980](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1980)\n\n## [2.0.4]\n\n> Release date: 2021/10/22\n\n#### Added\n\n- Go Module V2 has been published so that APIs and Clients\n  can be imported from external Golang projects.\n  [#1936](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1936)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a bug where the admission server's logger was missing, resulting in\n  panics when the admission server tried logging.\n  [#1954](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1954)\n- The admission controller now also validates KongClusterPlugin resources.\n  [#1764](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1764)\n- Fixed a segfault when the version reporter failed to initialize.\n  [#1961](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1961)\n\n## [2.0.3]\n\n> Release date: 2021/10/19\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Debug logging for resource status updates have been fixed to ensure that\n  debug output isn't silently lost and to fix some formatting issues.\n  [#1930](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1930)\n- Fixed a bug where Ingress resources would not be able to receive status\n  updates containing relevant addresses in environments where LoadBalancer\n  type services provision slowly.\n  [#1931](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1931)\n\n## [2.0.2]\n\n> Release date: 2021/10/14\n\n#### Added\n\n- Builds now produce Red Hat UBI-based images.\n\n## [2.0.1]\n\n> Release date: 2021/10/11\n#### Added\n\n- The ingress controller version now gets logged on startup.\n  [#1911](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1911)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue reading workspace information with RBAC permissions that\n  only allow access to the specified workspace.\n  [#1900](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1900)\n\n## [2.0.0]\n\n> Release date: 2021/10/07\n\n**NOTE**: This changelog entry was compiled from every changelog entry in the\n  `alpha` and `beta` pre-releases of `2.0.0`. If you're looking for the interim\n  changelog between `alpha` and/or `beta` versions prior to the release see\n  the [historical changelog here][alpha-beta-changelog].\n\n[alpha-beta-changelog]:https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/3e9761c378d02eda1c4622d87b899ea9ea4c35b4/CHANGELOG.md\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\nWhile you're reviewing the breaking changes below we also recommend you check\nout our [upgrade guide][upgrade-1-3-to-2-0] which covers upgrading from the\nprevious `v1.3.x` releases to this release.\n\n- The admission webhook now requires clients that support TLS 1.2 or higher.\n  [#1671](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1671)\n- autonegotiation of the Ingress API version (extensions v1beta1, networking\n  v1beta1, networking v1) has been disabled. Instead, the user is expected to\n  set **exactly** one of:\n  `--controller-ingress-networkingv1`\n  `--controller-ingress-networkingv1beta1`\n  `--controller-ingress-extensionsv1beta1`\n- several miscellaneous flags have been removed.\n  The following flags are no longer present:\n  - `--disable-ingress-extensionsv1beta1` (replaced by `--enable-controller-ingress-extensionsv1beta1=false`)\n  - `--disable-ingress-networkingv1` (replaced by `--enable-controller-ingress-networkingv1=false`)\n  - `--disable-ingress-networkingv1beta1` (replaced by `--enable-controller-ingress-networkingv1beta1=false`)\n  - `--version`\n  - `--alsologtostderr`\n  - `--logtostderr`\n  - `--v`\n  - `--vmodule`\n- support for \"classless\" ingress types has been removed.\n  The following flags are no longer present:\n  - `--process-classless-ingress-v1beta1`\n  - `--process-classless-ingress-v1`\n  - `--process-classless-kong-consumer`\n- `--dump-config` (a diagnostic option) is now a boolean. `true` is equivalent\n  to the old `enabled` value. `false` is equivalent to the old `disabled`\n  value. `true` with the additional new `--dump-sensitive-config=true` flag is\n  equivalent to the old `sensitive` value.\n- The historical `--stderrthreshold` flag is now deprecated: it no longer has\n  any effect when used and will be removed in a later release.\n  [#1297](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1297)\n- The `--update-status-on-shutdown` flag which supplements the `--update-status`\n  flag has been deprecated and will no longer have any effect, it will be removed\n  in a later release.\n  [#1304](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1304)\n- the `--sync-rate-limit` is now deprecated in favor of `--sync-time-seconds`.\n  This functionality no longer blocks goroutines until the provided number of\n  seconds has passed to enforce rate limiting, now instead it configures a\n  non-blocking [time.Ticker][go-tick] that runs at the provided seconds\n  interval. Input remains a float that indicates seconds.\n- Per documentation and by design, KongClusterPlugin resources require an\n  `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation, but this was not fully enforced. In\n  2.0, all KongClusterPlugin resources require this annotation set to the\n  controller's ingress class. Check your resources to confirm they are annotated\n  before upgrading.\n  [#2090](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/2090)\n\n[upgrade-1-3-to-2-0]:https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/2.0.x/guides/upgrade/\n\n#### Added\n\n- Individual controllers can now be enabled or disabled at a granular level.\n  For example you can disable the controller for `TCPIngress` with:\n  `--enable-controller-tcpingress=false`\n  To see the entire list of configurable controllers run the controller manager\n  with `--help`.\n  [#1638](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1638)\n- The `--watch-namespace` flag was added and supports watching a single\n  specific namespace (e.g. `--watch-namespace namespaceA`) or multiple\n  distinct namespaces using a comma-separated list (e.g.\n  `--watch-namespace \"namespaceA,namespaceB\"`). If not provided the default\n  behavior is to watch **all namespaces** as it was in previous releases.\n  [#1317](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1317)\n- UDP support was added via the `v1beta1.UDPIngress` API.\n  [#1454](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1454)\n  [UDP Blog Post][kong-udp]\n- Renamed roles and bindings to reflect their association with Kong.\n  [#1801](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1801)\n- Upgraded Kong Gateway from 2.4 to 2.5\n  [#1684](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1684)\n- Decreased log level of some status update messages.\n  [#1641](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1641)\n- Added metrics tracking whether configuration was successfully generated and\n  applied and the time taken to sync configuration to Kong.\n  [#1622](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1622)\n- Added a [Prometheus operator PodMonitor](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/v2.0.0-beta.1/config/prometheus/monitor.yaml)\n  to scrape controller and Kong metrics. To use it:\n  ```\n  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/main/config/prometheus/monitor.yaml\n  ```\n  [#1657](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1657)\n- Added controller functional metrics in 2.x\n  [#705](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/705)\n- Implemented Ingress status updates in 2.x.\n  [#1451](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1451)\n- Added `--publish-status-address` and `--publish-service` flags to 2.x.\n  [#1451](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1451)\n  [#1509](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1509)\n- Added scripts to generate 2.x manifests.\n  [#1563](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1563)\n- Added support for --dump-config to 2.x.\n  [#1589](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1589)\n- profiling using `pprof` is now a standalone HTTP server listening on port 10256.\n- adds support for selector tags (filter) tags refractored work. KIC 1.x\n  [#1415](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1415)\n- Profiling using `pprof` is now a standalone HTTP server listening on port 10256.\n  [#1417](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1417)\n- Reduced 2.x RBAC permissions to match 1.x permissions and added a generated\n  single-namespace Role that matches the ClusterRole.\n  [#1457](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1457)\n- support for the `konghq.com/host-aliases` annotation.\n  [#1016](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1016/)\n- Added `--proxy-timeout-seconds` flag to configure the kong client api timeout.\n  [#1401](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1401)\n\n[kong-udp]:https://konghq.com/blog/kong-gateway-2-2-released/#UDP-Support\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- In DB-less mode, the controller only marks itself ready once it has\n  successfully applied configuration at least once. This ensures that proxies\n  do not start handling traffic until they are configured.\n  [#1720](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1720)\n- Prometheus metrics were not exposed on the metrics endpoint in 2.0.0-beta.1 by default\n  [#1497](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1497)\n- Resolved an issue where certain UDPIngress and TCPIngress configurations\n  resulted in overlapping incompatible Kong configuration.\n  [#1702](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1702)\n- Fixed a panic that would occur in the controller manager when a\n  `KongConsumer` object with an empty name was submitted.\n  Any `KongConsumer` resource created with an empty `UserName` will\n  now throw an error in the controller manager logs (this wont stop\n  other configurations from proceeding), but the object in question\n  will thereafter otherwise be skipped for backend configuration\n  until the resource has been corrected.\n  [#1658](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1658)\n- The controller will now retry unsuccessful TCPIngress status updates.\n  [#1641](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1641)\n- The controller now correctly disables Knative controllers automatically when\n  Knative controllers are not installed.\n  [#1585](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1585)\n- Corrected the old Ingress v1beta1 API group.\n  [#1584](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1584)\n- Updated our Knative API support for more recent upstream releases.\n  [#1148] (https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1396)\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Updated the compiler to [Go v1.17](https://golang.org/doc/go1.17)\n  [#1714](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1714)\n- Code for the previous v1.x releases of the Kubernetes Ingress Controller\n  have been removed. Maintenance of the v1.x era codebase lives on in the\n  `1.3.x` and related branches going forward.\n  [#1591](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1591)\n- Made assorted improvements to CI and test code.\n  [#1646](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1646)\n  [#1664](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1664)\n  [#1669](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1669)\n  [#1672](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1672)\n- New `v1` versions of `CustomResourceDefinitions` introduced for KIC 2.0 are now\n  backwards compatible with the previous `v1beta1` CRD definitions (i.e. `v1beta1 -> v1`\n  upgrades of KIC's CustomResourceDefinitions now work fully automatically). In practice\n  the upgrade process should be seamless for end-users (e.g. `kubectl apply -f <NEW CRDS>`).\n  If you're interested in better understanding the differences and what's going on\n  under the hood, please see the relevant PR which includes the user facing changes.\n  [Kubernetes#79604](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79604)\n  [#1133](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1133)\n- The uuid generation is now done by the same library in the whole project\n  [#1604](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/1604)\n- the controller manager will no longer log multiple entries for `nil` updates\n  to the Kong Admin API. The result is that operators will no longer see multiple\n  \"no configuration change, skipping sync to kong\" entries for any single update,\n  instead it will only report this `nil` update scenario the first time it is\n  encountered for any particular SHA derived from the configuration contents.\n- project layout for contributions has been changed: this project now uses the\n  [Kubebuilder SDK][kubebuilder] and there are layout changes and\n  configurations specific to the new build environment.\n- controller architecture has been changed: each API type now has an\n  independent controller implementation and all controllers now utilize\n  [controller-runtime][controller-runtime].\n- full integration testing in [Golang][go] has been added for testing APIs and\n  controllers on a fully featured Kubernetes cluster, this is now supported by\n  the new [Kong Kubernetes Testing Framework (KTF)][ktf] project and now runs\n  as part of CI.\n- the mechanism for caching and resolving Kong Admin `/config` configurations\n  when running in `DBLESS` mode has been reimplemented to enable fine-tuned\n  configuration options in later iterations.\n- contains the refactored admission webhook server. The server key and\n  certificate flags have improved semantics: the default flag value is no\n  longer the default path, but an empty string. When both key/cert value flags\n  and key/cert file flags remain unset, KIC will read cert/key files from the\n  default paths, as said in the flag descriptions. This change should not\n  affect any existing configuration - in all configuration cases, behavior is\n  expected to remain unchanged.\n- taking configuration values from environment variables no longer uses Viper.\n\n[go-tick]:https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Ticker\n[kubebuilder]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder\n[controller-runtime]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime\n[go]:https://golang.org\n[ktf]:https://github.com/kong/kubernetes-testing-framework\n\n## [1.3.4]\n\n> Release date: 2022/01/19\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Anonymous reports now use TLS instead of UDP.\n  [#2089](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/2089)\n\n## [1.3.3]\n\n> Release date: 2021/10/01\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fixed invalid plugin validation code in admission controller.\n  [go-kong#81](https://github.com/Kong/go-kong/pull/81)\n- Fixed a panic when sorting consumers.\n  [#1658](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1658)\n\n## [1.3.2]\n\n> Release date: 2021/08/12\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Updated Alpine image to 3.14.\n  [#1691](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1691/)\n- Update Kong images to 2.5.\n\n## [1.3.1]\n\n> Release date: 2021/06/03\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- fixed a bug that now stops `v1.3.x` releases from advertising themselves as `v2` if manually built with default configurations.\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Upgraded CI dependencies\n- Some cleanup iterations on RELEASE.md release process\n\n## [1.3.0]\n\n> Release date: 2021/05/27\n\n#### Added\n\n- support for the `konghq.com/host-aliases` annotation.\n  [#1016](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1016/)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Sort SNIs and certificates consistently to avoid an issue with unnecessary\n  configuration re-syncs.\n  [#1268](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1268/)\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Upgraded various dependencies.\n\n## [1.2.0]\n\n> Release date: 2021/03/24\n\n#### Added\n\n- Ingresses now support `konghq.com/request-buffering` and\n  `konghq.com/response-buffering` annotations, which set the\n  `request-buffering` and `response-buffering` settings on associated Kong\n  routes.\n  [#1016](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1016/)\n- Added `--dump-config` flag to dump generated Kong configuration to a\n  temporary file to debug issues where the controller generates unexpected\n  configuration or unacceptable configuration. When set to `enabled` it redacts\n  sensitive values (credentials and certificate keys), and when set to\n  `sensitive`, it includes all configuration.\n  [#991](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/991/)\n- Added support for mtls-auth plugin credentials (requires Enterprise 2.3.2.0\n  or newer).\n  [#1078](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1078/)\n- The KongClusterPlugin CRD is now optional, for installation in clusters\n  where KIC administrators do not have cluster-wide permissions.\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- The admission webhook can now validate KongPlugin configurations stored in a\n  Secret.\n  [#1036](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1036/)\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Build configuration allows target architectures other than `amd64`.

Make sure to update your Go version if you build your own\n  controller binaries.\n  [#1110](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1110/)\n- Refactored synchronization loop into more discrete components and created\n  packages for them.\n  [#1027](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1027/)\n  [#1029](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1029/)\n- Broad refactoring (with the purpose of exposing KIC's logic as libraries), in preparation for an architectural upgrade of KIC to a [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)-based\n  implementation of the controller (expected to be released as KIC v2.0).\n  [#1037](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1037/)\n- Added a Go-based integration test environment and initial set of tests.\n  [#1102](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/1102/)\n- CI improvements check test coverage for PRs and automaticall open PRs for\n  dependency updates.\n- Upgraded almost all Go library dependencies (from now on, using Dependabot to ensure that minor releases use the newest versions available).\n\n## [1.1.1]\n\n> Release date: 2021/01/07\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Ingress controller now correctly sets ports for ExternalName services [#985](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/985)\n- TCPIngress CRD: removed the duplicated subresource YAML key [#997](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/997)\n\n#### Deprecated\n\n- Removed Helm 2 installation instructions because Helm 2 is EOL. Use Helm 3 instead. [#993](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/993)\n\n## [1.1.0]\n\n> Release date: 2020/12/09\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- The controller no longer supports Cassandra-backed Kong clusters, following\n  deprecation in 0.9.0. You must migrate to a Postgres-backed or DB-less\n  cluster before upgrading to 1.1.0. The controller will restore configuration\n  from Kubernetes resources (Ingresses, Services, KongPlugins, etc.) into the\n  new datastore automatically. Kong Enterprise users with\n  non-controller-managed configuration (Portal configuration, RBAC\n  configuration, etc.) will need to migrate that configuration manually.\n  [#974](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/974)\n\n#### Added\n\n- The default Kong version is now 2.2.x and the default Kong Enterprise version\n  is now 2.2.0.0.\n  [#932](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/932)\n  [#965](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/965)\n- The default worker count is now 2 instead of 1. This avoids request latency\n  during blocking configuration changes.\n  [#957](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/957)\n- Knative Services now support `konghq.com/override` (for attaching\n  KongIngress resources).\n  [#908](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/908)\n- Added the `konghq.com/snis` Ingress annotation. This populates SNI\n  configuration on the routes derived from the annotated Ingress.\n  [#863](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/863)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- The controller now correctly prints the affected Service name when logging\n  warnings about Services without any endpoints.\n  [#915](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/915)\n- Credentials that lack critical fields no longer result in a panic.\n  [#944](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/944)\n\n## [1.0.0]\n\n> Release date: 2020/10/05\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- The controller no longer supports versions of Kong prior to 2.0.0.\n  [#875](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/875)\n- Deprecated 0.x.x flags are no longer supported. Please see [the documentation\n  changes](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/866/files#diff-9a686fb3bf9c18ab81952a0933fb5c00)\n  for a complete list of removed flags and their replacements. Note that this\n  change applies to both flags and their equivalent environment variables, e.g.\n  for `--admin-header`, if you set `CONTROLLER_ADMIN_HEADER`, you should now\n  use `CONTROLLER_KONG_ADMIN_HEADER`.\n  [#866](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/866)\n- KongCredential custom resources are no longer supported. You should convert\n  any KongCredential resources to [credential Secrets](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/1.0.x/guides/using-consumer-credential-resource/#provision-a-consumer)\n  before upgrading to 1.0.0.\n  [#862](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/862)\n- Deprecated 0.x.x annotations are no longer supported. Please see [the\n  documentation changes](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/873/files#diff-777e08783d63482620961c4f93a1e1f6)\n  for a complete list of removed annotations and their replacements.\n  [#873](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/873)\n\n#### Added\n\n- The controller Docker registry now has minor version tags. These always point\n  to the latest patch release for a given minor version, e.g. if `1.0.3` is the\n  latest patch release for the `1.0.x` series, the `1.0` Docker tag will point\n  to `1.0.3`.\n  [#747](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/747)\n- Custom resources now all have a status field. For 1.0.0, this field is a\n  placeholder, and does not contain any actual status information. Future\n  versions will add status information that reflects whether the controller has\n  created Kong configuration for that custom resource.\n  [#824](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/824)\n- Version compatibility documentation now includes [information about supported\n  Kubernetes versions for a given controller version](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/1.0.x/references/version-compatibility/#kubernetes).\n  [#820](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/820)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- EKS documentation now uses hostnames rather than IP addresses.\n  [#877](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/877)\n\n## [0.10.0]\n\n> Release date: 2020/09/15\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- Ingress resources now require `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotations by\n  default. Kong recommends adding this annotation to Ingresses that previously\n  did not have it, but you can override this change and instruct the controller\n  to process Ingresses without this annotation if desired. See the [ingress\n  class documentation](https://example.com/link-tbd) for details.\n  [#767](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/767)\n- KongConsumer resources now require `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotations\n  by default. This change can also be overriden using a flag.\n  [#767](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/767)\n- TCPIngress resources now require `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotations.\n  This change _cannot_ be overriden.\n  [#767](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/767)\n- CA certificate secrets now require `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotations.\n  This change _cannot_ be overriden.\n  [#815](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/815)\n- Removed support for global KongPlugin resources. You must now use\n  KongClusterPlugin resources for global plugins. You should run\n  `kubectl get kongplugin -l global=true --all-namespaces` to list existing\n  global KongPlugins to find and convert them before upgrading. The controller\n  will also log a warning if it finds any global KongPlugins that are still in\n  place.\n  [#751](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/751)\n\n\n#### Added\n\n- Added support for [Ingress\n  v1](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/1453-ingress-api#summary-of-the-proposed-changes).\n  [#832](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/832).\n  [#843](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/843).\n- Added support for the port mapping functionality in Kong versions 2.1 and\n  newer in example manifests. This feature [improves Kong's functionality when\n  behind a load balancer that uses different ports than Kong's proxy\n  listens](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/5861).\n  [#753](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/753)\n- Added support for the `ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect` annotation.\n  [#745](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/745)\n- Transitioned to structured logging.\n  [#748](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/748)\n- Added flags to enable processing of Ingress and KongConsumer resources\n  without `ingress.class` annotations regardless of the controller class.\n  Previously, this functionality was only available when using the default\n  controller class, and could not be disabled.\n  [#767](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/767)\n- Added support for `admission.k8s.io/v1` validating webhooks.\n  [#759](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/759)\n- Migrated to Go 1.13-style error handling.\n  [#765](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/765)\n- Added documentation for using the controller along with Istio.\n  [#798](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/798)\n- Updated documentation to include information on Kong 2.1.\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Removed `securityContext` from example deployments. Earlier Kong versions\n  had to run as root to support some Enterprise features. This is no longer the\n  case in modern Kong versions.\n  [#672](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/672)\n- Added missing documentation for `--enable-reverse-sync` flag.\n  [#718](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/718)\n- Fixed a bug where the controller did not track updates to resources that\n  should not have required `ingress.class` unless that annotation was present.\n  [#767](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/767)\n- Clarified build instructions for pushing Docker artifacts.\n  [#768](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/768)\n- Improved controller startup behavior in scenarios where Kong was not\n  available. The controller will now retry and exit with an error after a\n  timeout, rather than hanging indefinitely.\n  [#771](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/771)\n  [#799](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/799)\n- Addressed several documentation typos and incongruent examples.\n  [#776](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/776)\n  [#785](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/785)\n  [#809](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/809)\n- Corrected a Helm 3 example that still used deprecated Helm 2 flags.\n  [#793](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/793)\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Improved tests by removing many hard-coded default values. The tests now\n  reference variables that define the default value in a single location.\n  [#815](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/815)\n- Added CI warning when base and single-file example manifests diverge.\n  [#797](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/797)\n- Updated Kubernetes dependencies from v0.17.x to v0.19.0 and switched from\n  `knative.dev/serving` to `knative.dev/networking`.\n  [#813](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/813)\n  [#817](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/817)\n- Updated Go build configuration to use Go 1.15.\n  [#816](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/816)\n\n## [0.9.1]\n\n> Release date: 2020/06/08\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Parse TLS section of Knative Ingress resources\n  [#721](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/721)\n\n## [0.9.0]\n\n> Release date: 2020/05/26\n\n#### Breaking change\n\nHealth-check behavior of the default manifest has been changed to use\n`status` interface of Kong instead of a simple Nginx server block.\nThe change is transparent and doesn't require any additional work.\n[#634](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/634)\n\n### Deprecations\n\nKong deployments backed by Cassandra are deprecated and will not be supported\nin future. Cassandra deployments for Ingress Controller use cases are rare\nand seldom make sense since the features that Cassandra brings are\nprovided by other means in such architectures.\n[#617](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/617)\n\n#### Added\n\n- **Plugin configuration via Kubernetes Secrets**  Configuration of plugins\n  can be stored in Kubernetes Secrets and then referenced in `KongPlugin`\n  and `KongClusterPlugin` resources.\n  [#618](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/618)\n- **mTLS authentication**  The controller can configure CA Certificates\n  in Kong and these can be used by `mtls-auth` plugin in Kong. The plugin\n  is currently enterprise-only.\n  [#616](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/616)\n- **Kong Custom entities in DB-less mode** Custom entities used in\n  custom plugins can now be configured for DB-less deployments of Kong.\n  [#630](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/630)\n- **Host-header manipulation**  Host header of a request destined to a\n  Kubernetes Service can now be manipulated using the `konghq.com/host-header`\n  annotation on the `Service` resource.\n  [#597](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/597)\n- **Method-based routing**  Method based routing can be performed using the\n  Ingress resource. A new annotation `konghq.com/methods` can now be used to\n  match HTTP method in addition to HTTP `host` and `path`. This was\n  previously supported only via `KongIngress` Custom Resource.\n  [#591](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/591)\n- **New configuration options** Following new CLI flags and corresponding\n  environment variables have been added:\n  - `--admission-webhook-cert`, `--admission-webhook-key`\n    and `--kong-admin-ca-cert`. These have been added to ease configuration\n    by enabling users to supply sensitive values using `Secret`\n    references inside `PodSpec`.\n    [#628](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/628)\n  - `--kong-custom-entities-secret` flag has been added to support\n    custom entities in DB-less mode feature.\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Some errors that were previously ignored are being caught and handled\n  correctly\n  [#635](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/635)\n- Ingress rules with consecutive slashes (`//`) are now ignored\n  [#663](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/663)\n\n## [0.8.1]\n\n> Release date: 2020/04/15\n\n#### Added\n\n- Added `--enable-reverse-sync` flag to enable checks from Kong to kubernetes\n  state. This should be enabled only if a human has access to Kong's Admin API\n  or Kong Manager (for Enterprise users). This flag will disable an optimization\n  in the controller and result in an increase read activity on Kong's Admin\n  API and database.\n  [#559](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/559)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Fix certificate and SNI sync to avoid a deadlock due to a conflict when\n  Kong is running with a database backend.\n  [#524](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/524)\n- Correctly set Knative Ingress Status\n  [#600](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/600)\n\n## [0.8.0]\n\n> Release date: 2020/03/25\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- **`strip_path` disabled by default**\n  The value of `strip_path` of routes in Kong is now set to `false`.\n  If you are upgrading from a previous version, please carefully test the change\n  before rolling it out as this change can possibly break the routing\n  for your clusters.\n  You can use `konghq.com/strip-path` annotation to set the value to `true`.\n\n#### Deprecations\n\nThe following annotations are now deprecated and will be removed in a future\nrelease:\n- `configuration.konghq.com`\n- `plugins.konghq.com`\n- `configuration.konghq.com/protocols`\n- `configuration.konghq.com/protocol`\n- `configuration.konghq.com/client-cert`\n\nPlease read the annotations document for new annotations.\n\n#### Added\n\n- **Knative Ingress support**  The controller can now proxy traffic for\n  serverless workloads running on top of Knative. Users can also select\n  Kong plugins to execute on a per Knative workload/service basis.\n  [#563](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/563)\n- **TCP/TLS routing**  New Custom Resource TCPIngress has been introduced\n  to support TCP proxy. SNI-based proxying is also supported for TLS encrypted\n  TCP streams.\n  [#527](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/527)\n- **New Custom Resource KongClusterPlugin**  Plugin configuration can now\n  be shared acrossed Kubernetes namespaces using `KongClusterPlugin`, a new\n  cluster-level Custom Resource.\n  [#520](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/520)\n- **New annotation group `konghq.com`** A new annotations group has\n  been introduced which should simplify configuration and reduce the need of\n  `KongIngress` resource in most use-cases. The following new annotations\n  have been introduced:\n  - `konghq.com/plugins`\n  - `konghq.com/override`\n  - `konghq.com/client-cert`\n  - `konghq.com/protocols`\n  - `konghq.com/protocol`\n  - `konghq.com/preserve-host`\n  - `konghq.com/plugins`\n  - `konghq.com/override`\n  - `konghq.com/path`\n  - `konghq.com/strip-path`\n  - `konghq.com/https-redirect-status-code`\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Admission webhook now checks for the correct fields for JWT credential\n  type.\n  [#556](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/556)\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- decK has been upgraded to v1.0.3.\n  [#576](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/576)\n- Go has been upgraded to 1.14.\n  [#579](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/579)\n- Alpine docker image has been upgraded to 3.11.\n  [#567](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/567)\n\n## [0.7.1]\n\n> Release date: 2020/01/31\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis releases contains bug-fixes only. All users are advised to upgrade.\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- De-duplicate SNIs when the same SNI is associated with multiple secrets.\n  [#510](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/510)\n- `plugin.RunOn` is not injected when Kong version >= 2.0.0.\n  [#521](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/521)\n- Parse default backend in `Ingress` resource correctly.\n  [#511](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/511)\n- KongPlugin resources with `global: true` label are correctly processed\n  to include `protocols` fields while rendering Kong's configuration.\n  [#502](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/502)\n- Admission Controller: correctly process updates to `KongConsumer` resource\n  [#501](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/501)\n- Do not send multiple update events for a single CRD update\n  [#514](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/514)\n\n## [0.7.0]\n\n> Release date: 2020/01/06\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis release adds secret-based credentials, gRPC routing, upstream mutual\nauthentication, DB-less deployment by default and performance improvements.\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- The default value of `--admission-webhook-listen` flag is now `off` to avoid\n  an error in the logs when the cert and key pair is not provided. Users will\n  have to explicitly set this flag to `:8080` to enable it. Please do note that\n  it is recommended to always set up the Admission Controller.\n\n#### Added\n\n- **Multi-port services** Ingress rules forwarding traffic to multiple ports\n  of the same services are now supported. The names of the services configured\n  in Kong have been changed to include the port number/name for uniqueness.\n  [#404](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/404)\n- When using the controller with Kong Enterprise,\n  Controller now attempts to create the workspace configured via\n  `--kong-workspace`, if it does not exist.\n  [#429](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/429)\n- **Controller configuration revamped** Configuration of the controller itself\n  can now be tweaked via environment flags and CLI flags, both. Environment\n  variables and Secrets can be used to pass sensitive information to the\n  controller.\n  [#436](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/436)\n- **Encrypted credentials via Secrets** Credentials can now be configured via\n  `Secret` resource from the Kubernetes core API. These credentials are\n  encrypted at rest by Kubernetes. The controller loads these secrets into\n  Kong's memory or database from the Kubernetes data-store.\n  [#430](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/430)\n- **Multi-entity plugins** Plugins can now be configured for a combination of\n  an Ingress rule(s) and KongConsumer or a combination of a Service\n  and KongConsumer.\n  [#386](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/386)\n- **Mutual authentication using mTLS** Kong and the Kubernetes Service can\n  mutually authenticate each other now. Use the new\n  `configuration.konghq.com/client-cert` annotation on a Kubernetes Service\n  to specify the cert-key pair Kong should use to authenticate itself.\n  [#483](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/483)\n- **gRPC routing** Kong Ingress Controller can now expose and proxy gRPC\n  protocol based services, in addition to HTTP-based services. These can\n  be configured using the core Ingress resource itself.\n  [#454](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/454)\n- **Performance improvement** Number of sync calls to Kong, in both DB and\n  DB-less mode, should be reduced by an order of magnitude for most deployments.\n  This will also improve Kong's performance.\n  [#484](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/484)\n- `credentials` property has been added to the `KongConsumer` Custom Resource.\n  This property holds the references to the secrets containing the credentials.\n  [#430](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/430)\n- Flag `--kong-admin-filter-tag` has been added to change the tag used\n  to filter and managed entity in Kong's database. This defaults to\n  `managed-by-ingress-controller`.\n  [#440](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/440)\n- Flag `--kong-admin-concurrency` has been added to control the number of\n  concurrent requests between the controller and Kong's Admin API.\n  This defaults to `10`.\n  [#481](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/481)\n- Flag `--kong-admin-token` has been added to supply the RBAC token\n  for the Admin API for Kong Enterprise deployments.\n  [#489](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/489)\n- Admission Controller now validates Secret-based credentials. It ensures that\n  the required fields are set in the secret and the credential type is a\n  valid one.\n  [#446](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/446)\n- `http2` is now enabled by default on the TLS port.\n  [#456](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/456)\n- DB-less or the in-memory mode is now the new default in the reference\n  manifests. It is recommended to run Kong without a database for Ingress\n  Controller deployments.\n  [#456](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/456)\n- `upstream.host_header` property has been added to the `KongIngress` Custom\n  Resource. This property can be used to change the `host` header in every\n  request that is sent to the upstream service.\n  [#478](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/478)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Every event in the queue is not logged anymore as it can leak sensitive\n  information in the logs. Thanks to [@goober](https://github.com/goober)\n  for the report.\n  [#439](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/439)\n- For database deployments, `upstream` entity are now created with `round-robin`\n  as default `algorithm` to avoid false positives during a sync operation.\n  These false positives can have a negative impact on Kong's performance.\n  [#480](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/480)\n\n\n#### Deprecated\n\n- `KongCredential` Custom Resource is now deprecated and will be remove in a\n  future release. Instead, please use Secret-based credentials.\n  [#430](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/430):\n- Following flags have been deprecated and new ones have been added in place\n  [#436](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/436):\n  - `--kong-url`, instead use `--kong-admin-url`\n  - `--admin-tls-skip-verify`, instead use `--kong-admin-tls-skip-verify`\n  - `--admin-header`, instead use `--kong-admin-header`\n  - `--admin-tls-server-name`, instead use `--kong-admin-tls-server-name`\n  - `--admin-ca-cert-file`, instead use `--kong-admin-ca-cert-file`\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- decK has been bumped up to v0.6.2.\n\n## [0.6.2]\n\n> Release date: 2019/11/13\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis is a minor patch release to fix version parsing issue with new\nKong Enterprise packages.\n\n## [0.6.1]\n\n> Release date: 2019/10/09\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis is a minor patch release to update Kong Ingress Controller's\nDocker image to use a non-root by default.\n\n## [0.6.0]\n\n> Release date: 2019/09/17\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis release introduces an Admission Controller for CRDs,\nIstio compatibility, support for `networking/ingress`,\nKong 1.3 additions and enhancements to documentation and deployments.\n\n#### Added\n\n- **Service Mesh integration** Kong Ingress Controller can now be deployed\n  alongside Service Mesh solutions like Kuma and Istio. In such a deployment,\n  Kong handles all the external client facing routing and policies while the\n  mesh takes care of these aspects for internal service-to-service traffic.\n- **`ingress.kubernetes.io/service-upstream`**, a new annotation has\n  been introduced.\n  Adding this annotation to a Kubernetes service resource\n  will result in Kong directly forwarding traffic to kube-proxy.\n  In other words, Kong will not send traffic directly to the pods.\n  [#365](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/365)\n- Ingress resources created in the new `networking.k8s.io` API group are\n  now be supported. The controller dynamically figures out the API group\n  to use based on the metadata it receives from k8s API-server.\n- **Kong Credential enhancements**\n  - Kong Credentials are now live-synced as they are created and updated in\n    DB-mode.\n    [#230](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/#230)\n  - A single Consumer can now contain multiple credentials of the same type\n    and multiple ACL group associations.\n    [#371](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/371)\n- **Admission controller** Kong Ingress Controller now ships with an in-built\n  admission controller for KongPlugin and KongConsumer entities. The validations\n  stop users from misconfiguring the Ingress controller.\n  [#372](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/372)\n- **Kong 1.3 support**:\n  - HTTP Header based routing is now supported using `KongIngress.Route.Headers`\n    property.\n  - The algorithm to use for load-balancing traffic sent upstream can be\n    set using `KongIngress.Upstream.Algorithm` field.\n- **Kustomize**: Users can now use `kustomize` to tweak the reference deployment\n  as per their needs. Both, DB and DB-less modes are supported. Please have\n  a look at `deploy/manifests` directory in the Github repository.\n- **Documentation**: The documentation for the project has been revamped.\n  Deployment guides, how-to guides, and reference docs have been added.\n- **Deployment**: The deployment of Kong Ingress Controller in DB and DB-less\n  modes has been simplified, and Kong Ingress Controller now always runs as a\n  side-car to Kong in proxy mode. There is no dedicated deployment for Kong\n  Ingress Controller that needs to be run.\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- SNIs and Certificates are now de-duplicated across namespaces.\n  [#360](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/#360)\n  [#327](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/#327)\n- Empty TLS secret no longer stops the controller from syncing configuration\n  [#321](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/#321)\n- Fix a nil reference when empty Ingress rules are created\n  [#365](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/365)\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Kubernetes client-go library has been updated to v1.15.3.\n- Credentials sync has been moved into decK and decK has been bumped up\n  to v0.5.1.\n\n## [0.5.0]\n\n> Release date: 2019/06/25\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis release introduces automated TLS certificates, consumer-level plugins,\nenabling deployments using controller and Kong's Admin API at the same time\nand numerous bug-fixes and enhancements.\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- UUID of consumers in Kong are no longer associated with UID of KongConsumer\n  custom resource.\n\n#### Added\n\n- Kong 1.2 is now supported, meaning wild-card hosts in TLS section of Ingress\n  resources are allowed.\n- **Automated TLS certificates using Let's Encrypt**: Use Kong's Ingress\n  Controller and\n  [cert-manager](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuing-certificates/ingress-shim.html)\n  to automatically provision TLS certs and serve them.\n- **Tagging support**: All entities managed by Kong Ingress Controller in Kong's\n  database are now tagged and the controller manages only a subset of Kong's\n  configuration. Any entity created via Kong's Admin API will not be\n  automatically deleted by the Ingress Controller.\n- **Consumer-level plugins** can now be configured by applying\n  `plugins.konghq.com` annotation on KongConsumer custom resources.\n  [#250](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/#250)\n- **Kong Enterprise workspaces**: Ingress Controller can manage a specific\n  workspace inside Kong Enterprise (previously, only default workspace).\n- Avoid reloading configuration in Kong in db-less mode when there is no\n  change in configuration.\n  [#308](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/308)\n- Service scoped plugins for Kong 1.1 are now configured correctly.\n  [#289](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/#289)\n\n#### Fixed\n\n- Multiple certificates are now correctly populated in Kong.\n  [#285](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/#285)\n- Missing entities like certificate secrets, services or plugins in Kubernetes\n  object store will not stop controller from syncing configuration to Kong.\n- A Ingress rule with an empty path is correctly parsed and populated in Kong.\n  [#98](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/#98)\n- Plugins with a nested schema are now correctly configured.\n  [#294](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/#294)\n\n#### Under the hood\n\n- Dependency management for the project is done using Go modules.\n- Kubernetes client-go library has been updated to v1.14.1.\n- Makefile and Dockerfiles have been simplified.\n\n## [0.4.0]\n\n> Release date: 2019/04/24\n\n#### Summary\n\nThis release introduces support to run Kong as an Ingress Controller\nwithout a database!\nThis release comes with major under the hood rewrites to fix numerous\nbugs and design issues in the codebase.

We really value documentation contributions\nsince that makes life easier for a lot of people.\n\nAll of the following tasks are noble and worthy contributions that you can\nmake without coding:\n\n- Reporting a bug\n- Helping other members of the community on the\n  [support channels](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller#seeking-help)\n- Fixing a typo in the code\n- Fixing a typo in the documentation\n- Providing your feedback on the proposed features and designs\n- Reviewing Pull Requests\n\nIf you wish to contribute code (features or bug fixes) please open pull requests with `main` as the base branch or `release/X.Y.x` if the fix shouldn't be targeted at newer versions.\n\n## Working with Pull Requests\n\nWhen you finish your work and want your contributions to be included, please submit a pull request\nand include necessary information about the pull request in its description following our\n[pull request template](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/a5cfca4a97927c2878fce593929a8e48442f3127/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).\nA clear title and description is helpful to encourage your pull request to be reviewed and merged.\n\nIf your pull request is still in progress, but you want to get early reviews before\nit is ready to be merged, please add `do not merge` or `work in progress` labels to the\npull request. If your pull request is not ready to be reviewed yet, please convert it to `Draft`.\n`Draft` pull requests will not be reviewed until they are converted to `Open` status.\n\n## Stale issue and pull request policy\n\nTo ensure our backlog is organized and up to date, we will close issues and\npull requests that have been inactive awaiting a community response for over 2\nweeks. If you wish to reopen a closed issue or PR to continue work, please\nleave a comment asking a team member to do so.\n\n## When to close an issue\n\nFor a GitHub issue describing a problem/feature request:\n\n- **Duplicates**. if there are other issues in the repository describing the same problem/FR:\n\n    1. find the issue that has the most context (possibly not the first reported)\n\n    1. close all other issues with a comment _Duplicate of #XYZ_\n\n- **Resolution by code**. if resolution involves creating PRs:\n\n    1. ensure that all PRs reference the issue they are solving. Keep in mind that the _fixes_/_resolves_ directive only works for PRs merged to the default branch of the repository.\n\n    1. close the issue as soon as all the PRs have been merged to **`main`**. If it's obvious from PRs that the issue has been resolved, a closing comment on the issue is purely optional.\n\n- **Other resolutions/rejections**. if resolution happens for any other reason (_resolved without code_, _user's question answered_, _won't fix_, _infeasible_, _not useful_, _alternative approach chosen_, _problem will go away in $FUTURE-VERSION_)\n\n    1. close the issue with a comment describing the resolution/reason.\n\nFor a closed issue, one can verify which released versions contain the fix/enhancement by navigating into the merge commit of each attached PR, where GitHub lists tags/branches that contain the merge commit.\nThus:\n\n- if the list includes a release tag: the fix/enhancement is included in that release tag.\n- if the list includes `release/X.Y.x` but no release tags: the fix/enhancement will come in the nearest patch release.\n- if the list includes `main` : the fix/enhancement will come in the next minor release.\n\n# Enhancements\n\nDocumenting and communicating the motivation for major enhancements in the Kong Kubernetes Ingress Controller (KIC) is done using an upstream Kubernetes process referred to as [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEPs)][kep].\n\n[kep]:https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements\n\n## New Enhancement Proposals\n\nWhen starting a new enhancement proposal use the upstream [KEP Template][template] file as the starting point for your KEP, and follow the instructions therein.\n\nInitially you can remove a lot of the scaffolding in the template for the first `provisional` iteration and focus on establishing the following sections:\n\n- Summary\n- Motivation\n- Goals\n- User Stories\n\nIn general the maintainers here feel establishing these things in a KEP should be done _prior to any technical writeups_ but this is a soft rule.\n\n[template]:https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md\n\n## Feature Gates\n\nNew features should be added to the [Feature Gates][kic-fg] documentation and `internal/manager/feature_gates.go`.\n\n[kic-fg]:https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/FEATURE_GATES.md\n\n## Development environment\n\n## Environment\n\n- Golang version matching our [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) installed\n- [Kubebuilder][kubebuilder]\n- [GNU Make][make]\n- [Docker][docker] (for building)\n- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (we use [KIND][kind] for development)\n\n[kubebuilder]:https://kubebuilder.io/\n[make]:https://www.gnu.org/software/make/\n[docker]:https://docs.docker.com/\n[kind]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe build uses dependencies are managed by [go modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules)\n\n## Developing\n\nDevelopment of our [Kubernetes Controllers][ctrl] and [APIs][kapi] is managed through the [Kubebuilder SDK][kubebuilder].\n\nPrior to developing we recommend you read through the [Makefile](/Makefile) directives related to generation of API configurations, and run through the [Kubebuilder Quickstart Documentation][kbquick] documentation in order to familiarize yourself with how the command line works, how to add new APIs and controllers, and how to update existing APIs.\n\nMake sure you're [generally familiar with Kubernetes Controllers as a concept, and how to build them][kbctrl].\n\n[ctrl]:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/\n[kapi]:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/\n[kbquick]:https://kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html\n[kbctrl]:https://kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/controller-overview.html\n\n## Running in dev mode\n\nYou can run the ingress controller without building a Docker\nImage and installing it onto your docker container.\n\nFollowing is a helpful shell script that you could\nuse to run the Ingress Controller without building\nthe Ingress Controller:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\npkill -f kubectl\n# setup proxies\nkubectl port-forward svc/kong-proxy -n kong 8443:443 2>&1 > /dev/null &\nkubectl port-forward svc/kong-proxy -n kong 8000:80 2>&1 > /dev/null &\nkubectl port-forward deploy/ingress-kong -n kong 8444:8444 2>&1 > /dev/null &\nkubectl proxy --port=8002 2>&1 > /dev/null &\n\nexport POD_NAME=`kubectl get po -n kong -o json | jq \".items[] | .metadata.name\" -r | grep ingress`\nexport POD_NAMESPACE=kong\n\ngo run -tags gcp ./internal/cmd/main.go \\\n--kubeconfig ~/.kube/config \\\n--publish-service=kong/kong-proxy \\\n--apiserver-host=http://localhost:8002 \\\n--kong-admin-url https://localhost:8444 \\\n--kong-admin-tls-skip-verify true\n```\n\nIf you are using Kind we can leverage [extraPortMapping config](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/ingress/)\n\n```shell\ncat <<EOF | kind create cluster --config=-\nkind: Cluster\napiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\nnodes:\n- role: control-plane\n  kubeadmConfigPatches:\n  -

Depending on your\nrequirements you can build a raw server binary, a local container image,\nor push an image to a remote repository.\n\n### Build a raw server binary\n\n```console\nmake build\n```\n\n### Build a local container image\n\n```console\nTAG=DEV REGISTRY=docker.example.com/registry make container\n```\n\nNote: this will use the Docker daemon\nrunning on your system.\nIf you're developing using minikube, you\nshould execute the following to use the\nDocker daemon running inside the Minikube VM:\n\n```console\neval $(minikube docker-env)\n```\n\nThis will allow you to publish images to\nMinikube VM, allowing you to reference them\nin your Deployment specs.\n\n### Push the container image to a remote repository\n\n```console\ndocker push docker.example.com/registry/kong-ingress-controller:DEV\n```\n\nNote: replace `docker.example.com/registry` with your registry URL.\n\n## Deploying\n\nThere are several ways to deploy Kong Ingress Controller onto a cluster.\nPlease check the [deployment guide](https://docs.konghq.com/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/deployment/overview/).\n\n## Linting\n\nYou can lint the codebase by running:\n\n```console\nmake lint\n```\n\npassing the above is required by CI.\n\n## Testing\n\nPlease see [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for a detailed description of testing KIC.\n\n## Releasing\n\nSee [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md).\n\n## Contributor Badge\n\nIf your Pull Request to Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller was accepted, and it fixes a bug, adds functionality, or makes it significantly easier to use or understand KIC, congratulations! You are eligible to receive a digital Contributor Badge!

Here in the Kubernetes Ingress Controller (KIC) we use the same definitions of `Feature Gates` and `Feature Stages` from upstream Kubernetes, but with our own list of features.\n\nUsing `Feature Gates` enables contributors to add and manage new (and potentially) experimental functionality to the KIC in a controlled manner: the features will be \"hidden\" until generally available (GA) and the progress and maturity of features on their path to GA will be documented. Feature gates also create a clear path for deprecating features.\n\nSee below for current features and their statuses, and follow the links to the relevant feature documentation.\n\n[k8s]:https://kubernetes.io\n[gates]:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\n[stages]:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages\n\n## Feature gates\n\nBelow you will find the overviews of features at various maturity levels:\n\n- [Feature gates for graduated or deprecated features](#feature-gates-for-graduated-or-deprecated-features)\n- [Feature gates for Alpha or Beta features](#feature-gates-for-alpha-or-beta-features)\n\nPlease read the [Important Notes](#important-notes) section before using any `Alpha` or `Beta` features.\n\n### Important notes\n\n- Most features will be planned and detailed using [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEP)][k8s-kep]: If you're interested in the development side of features familiarize yourself with our [KEPs][kic-keps]\n- The `Since` and `Until` rows in below tables refer to [KIC Releases][releases]\n- For `GA` features the documentation exists in the main [Kong Documentation][kong-docs], see the [API reference][api-ref] and [Guides][kic-guides]\n\nAn additional **warning** for end-users who are reading this documentation and trying to enable `Alpha` or `Beta` features: it is **very important** to understand that features that are currently in an `Alpha` or `Beta` state may **become `Deprecated` at any time** and **may be removed as part of the next consecutive minor release**. This is especially true for `Alpha` maturity features. In other words, **until a feature becomes GA there are no guarantees that it's going to continue being available**.

In Ingress and HTTPRoute the upstream service is associated\nwith individual rules or rule paths, whereas Kong routes associate the upstream\nservice with the entire route, which may allow multiple different paths.\n\nThis difference in layout means that a single Kong route often cannot represent\nan entire Ingress or HTTPRoute. For example, the Ingress\n\n```\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: example\nspec:\n  ingressClassName: kong\n  rules:\n  - host: \"ingress.example\"\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /one\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: red\n            port:\n              number: 80\n      - path: /two\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: red\n            port:\n              number: 80\n      - path: /three\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: blue\n            port:\n              number: 80\n```\n\nrequires more than one Kong route. A single route only supports a single\nservice, so placing all three paths on the same route would incorrectly direct\ntraffic destined for the `blue` service to the `red` service.\n\nTo account for this, KIC's traditional route generation strategy created a route\nfor every individual Ingress path. The Ingress above would generate three\nroutes, for paths `/one`, `/two`, and `/three`. This simple strategy ensures\nthat requests always route to the correct service, but results in a large number\nof routes. Larger configurations can affect performance, especially when loading\nconfiguration updates.\n\nCombined routes reduces configuration size by consolidating routes that share\nthe same service and hostname. The above example (where all paths use the same\nhostname) would instead result in two routes, one matching either `/one` or\n`/two` for service `red` and another matching `/three` for service `blue`.\n\nCombined routes thus does not change which requests are routed to which\nservices. It has no effect on request routing, only the arrangement of\nconfiguration. The number of routes and route names _will_ change, however, and\nyou should expect to see a disconnect in monitoring information (Prometheus\nmetrics, logging plugin output, etc.) and third-party tools that rely on route\nnames or IDs.\n\nCombined routes use a revised naming scheme. Traditional Ingress routes used a\n`<namespace>.<name>.<rule index><path index>` name format (e.g.\n`default.httpbin.00` for the first (0-indexed) rule's first path on the\n`httpbin` Ingress in the `default` namespace), whereas combined routes use a\n`<namespace>.<name>.<service>.<hostname>.<port>` scheme (e.g.\n`default.httpbin.httpbin.ing.example.80` for all paths in the `default/httpbin`\nIngress for the `httpbin` service on port `80` with the hostname `ing.example`).\nHTTPRoutes use the same `httproute.<namespace>.<name>.<rule>.<match>` scheme as\nbefore, but the indices are the _first_ rule and match with a given backendRef,\nwhereas traditional would generate routes for _every_ match. If rule 1 match 2\nhas the same backendRef as rule 3 match 1, you'll see a single `.1.2` route with\npaths from both.\n\nHTTPRoutes have more combination rules than Ingresses because their rules are\nmore expressive. Rules cannot be combined with others if they use different\nfilters, header matches, or query parameter matches, since these are implemented\nusing Kong settings that apply to an entire route.\n\nHTTPRoute backendRefs can target multiple Services. In traditional mode, KIC\ngenerates a Kong service for every backendRef, labeled with the rule and match\nindices. In combined mode, KIC generates a Kong service for every unique set of\nservices: if two HTTPRoute rules use both serviceA and serviceB in their\nbackendRefs, KIC will generate a single Kong service with endpoints from both\nserviceA and serviceB, named for the first rule and match indices with that\ncombination of Services.\n\n## Using KongServiceFacade\n\nIn KIC 3.1.0 we introduced a new feature called `KongServiceFacade`. Currently, we only\nsupport `KongServiceFacade` to be used as a backend for `networking.k8s.io/v1` `Ingress`es.\nIf you find this might be useful to you in other contexts (e.g. Gateway API's `HTTPRoute`s),\nplease let us know in the [#5216](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/5216)\nissue tracking this effort.\n\n### Installation\n\n`KongServiceFacade` feature is currently in `Alpha` maturity and is disabled by default.\nTo start using it, you must not only enable the feature gate (`KongServiceFacade=true`),\nbut also install the `KongServiceFacade` CRD which is distributed in a separate\npackage we named `incubator`. You can install it by running:\n\n```shell\nkubectl apply -k 'https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/config/crd/incubator?ref=main'\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce the CRD is installed and the feature gate is set to `true`, you can start using it by creating\n`KongServiceFacade` objects and use them as your `netv1.Ingress` backends. For example, to create\na `KongServiceFacade` that points to a service named `my-service` in the `default` namespace and uses\nits port number `80`, you can run:\n\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f - <<EOF\napiVersion: incubator.ingress-controller.konghq.com/v1alpha1\nkind: KongServiceFacade\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service-facade\n  namespace: default\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: kong\nspec:\n  backendRef:\n    name: my-service\n    port: 80\nEOF\n```\n\nFor a complete CRD reference please see the [incubator-crd-reference] document. \n\nTo use the `KongServiceFacade` as a backend for your `netv1.Ingress`, you can create an `Ingress`\nlike the following:\n\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f - <<EOF\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: my-ingress\n  namespace: default\n  annotations:\n    konghq.com/strip-path: \"true\"\nspec:\n  ingressClassName: kong\n  rules:\n  - http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /my-service\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          resource:\n            apiGroup: incubator.ingress-controller.konghq.com\n            kind: KongServiceFacade\n            name: my-service-facade\nEOF\n```\n\nPlease note the `KongServiceFacade` must be in the same namespace as the `Ingress` that uses it.\n\nAn advantage of using `KongServiceFacade` over plain `corev1.Service`s is that you can create multiple\n`KongServiceFacade`s that point to the same `Service` and KIC will always generate one Kong Service per each\n`KongServiceFacade`. That enables you to, e.g., use different `KongPlugin`s for each `KongServiceFacade`\nwhile still pointing to the same Kubernetes `Service`. A single `KongServiceFacade` may be used in multiple\n`Ingress`es and customization done through the `KongServiceFacade`'s annotations will be honored in all of them\non a single Kong Service level (no need to duplicate annotations in multiple `Ingress`es).\n\nA recommended, generally available alternative to `KongServiceFacade` exists: you can\ncreate several Kubernetes `Service`s with the same selector. `KongServiceFacade` should\nbe useful if you are unable to use the `Service` alternative. Reasons known at the\nmoment of writing are: using certain mesh solutions (Consul Connect) that [impose a\n\"single service only\" requirement](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/issues/68) and (hypothetical) performance implications of\nrepetitive kube-proxy reconciliation.\n\nFor a complete example of using `KongServiceFacade` for customizing `Service` authentication methods, please\nrefer to the [kong-service-facade.yaml] manifest in our examples.\n\n[incubator-crd-reference]: ./docs/incubator-api-reference.md\n[kong-service-facade.yaml]: ./examples/kong-service-facade.yaml\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\n    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n\n* Apache-2.0 *\n\n\nThis project is covered by two different licenses: MIT and Apache.\n\n#### MIT License ####\n\nThe following files were ported to Go from C files of libyaml, and thus\nare still covered by their original MIT license, with the additional\ncopyright staring in 2011 when the project was ported over:\n\n    apic.go emitterc.go parserc.go readerc.go scannerc.go\n    writerc.go yamlh.go yamlprivateh.go\n\nCopyright (c) 2006-2010 Kirill Simonov\nCopyright (c) 2006-2011 Kirill Simonov\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Definitions.\n\n      \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\n      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\n      \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\n      the copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\n      \"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\n      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\n      \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\n      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n      \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity\n      exercising permissions granted by this License.\n\n      \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\n      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\n      source, and configuration files.\n\n      \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\n      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\n      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\n      and conversions to other media types.\n\n      \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\n      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\"\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n   2. Grant of Copyright License.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

Redistribution.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   Copyright 2021 Fernandez Ludovic\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n\n\n* Apache-2.0 *\n\n                                Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\n\n* GPL-3.0-only *\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\n* GPL-3.0-only *\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\n\n* GPL-3.0-only *\n\n   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.

This is in place so that\n> simply running `go test ...` without any special build tags would pass without\n> requiring any manual setup from the developer (no failure due to missing `envtest`\n> related binaries or environment variables).\n\nTest definitions can be found both in dedicated directory - `test/envtest` - and\nthroughout the codebase next to code that they are testing.\nThis approach however may change over time.\nSuggestion for new `envtest` based tests is to be placed in `test/envtest` and to\ntest code as a black box, i.e. using only exported methods (which will be enforced\nvia running them from this dedicated package).\n\n[envtest]: https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/envtest\n[setup_envtest]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/tree/main/tools/setup-envtest\n[envtest_helpers]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/tree/611f3c6334424a700f9a00f2801c3cfa2b352d81/test/envtest\n\n#### How to run\n\n[`envtest`][envtest] based tests can be run via `test.envtest` `Makefile` target.\n\nOne can also use `./bin/setup-envtest use -p env` to obtain the asset dir environment\nvariable:\n\n```\n./bin/setup-envtest use -p env\nexport KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS='/Users/username/Library/Application Support/io.kubebuilder.envtest/k8s/1.27.1-darwin-arm64'\n```\n\nand use that to manually run the tests:\n\n```\n$ eval $(./bin/setup-envtest use -p env)\n$ go test -v -count 1 -tags envtest ./pkg/to/test\n...\n```\n\n### Integration tests\n\nKIC's integration tests rely on its controller manager being run in the same\nprocess as the tests via [`manager.Run()`][manager_run].\n\nThese tests rely on a [test suite setup][integration_test_suite]\nusing [`TestMain()`][pkggodev_testmain].\n\nSaid setup will either create a new [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) cluster or use an existing one to run the\ntests against.\n\nMost of the setup - and cleanup after the tests have run - is being done using\n[ktf][ktf].\n\nCurrently, the cluster is being shared across all the tests that are a part\nof the test suite so special care needs to be taken in order to clean up after the tests\nthat run.\nThe typical approach is to run them in a dedicated, disposable Kubernetes namespace created just for the purposes of that test.\n\n#### How to run\n\nIntegration tests are located under `tests/integration/` and use `integration_tests`\n[build tag][go_build_tag].\n\nYou can run them using one of the dedicated Makefile targets:\n\n- `test.integration` run all integration tests with standard verbose output on stderr.\n  This will run tests for dbless, postgres, enterprise and non enterprise.\n\n- `test.integration.dbless` run all dbless integration tests with standard\n  verbose output on stderr. The output will also include controllers' logs.\n\n- `test.integration.postgres` run all postgres integration tests with standard\n  verbose output on stderr. The output will also include controllers' logs.\n\nThrough `GOTESTFLAGS` you can specify custom flags that will be passed to `go test`.\nThis can allow you to run a subset of all the tests for faster feedback times, e.g.:\n\n```\nmake test.integration.dbless GOTESTFLAGS=\"-count 1 -run TestUDPRouteEssentials\"\n```\n\n[ktf]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-testing-framework\n[pkggodev_testmain]: https://pkg.go.dev/testing#hdr-Main\n[integration_test_suite]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/61e06ee64ff913aa9952816121125fca7ed59ba5/test/integration/suite_test.go#L36\n[manager_run]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/5abc699aeee552945a76c82e3f7abb3e1b2fabf1/internal/cmd/rootcmd/run.go#L14-L22\n\n### Isolated integration tests\n\nSimilarly to KIC's integration tests, isolated integration tests rely on its\ncontroller manager being run in the same process as the tests via [`manager.Run()`][manager_run].\n\nThese tests rely on [kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework][github-e2e-framework] for setup,\nteardown, tests filtering etc.\n\nSaid setup will either create a new [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) cluster or use an existing one to run the\ntests against.\n\nMost of the setup - and cleanup after the tests have run - is being done using [ktf][ktf].\n\nCurrently, the cluster is being shared across all the tests that are a part\nof the test suite so special care needs to be taken in order to clean up after the tests\nthat run.\nThe typical approach is to run them in a dedicated, disposable Kubernetes namespace created just for the purposes of that test.\n\n#### Difference between isolated and regular integration tests\n\nThere are a couple of key differences between isolated and regular integration tests:\n\n- In isolated tests each test's [`Feature`][pkggodev-e2e-framework-feature] gets\n  its own Kong deployment through the means of [ktf][ktf]'s Kong addon.\n- In isolated tests each test's [`Feature`][pkggodev-e2e-framework-feature] gets\n  its own controller manager instance started which is configured against the above\n  mentioned kong instance.\n  Said controller manager instance will be configured to only watch `Feature`'s\n  dedicated namespace (more info below) via `--watch-namespace`.\n  You can add more namespaces for the controller manager to watch via\n  `ControllerManagerOptAdditionalWatchNamespace` `featureSetup` option:\n\n  ```go\n  ...\n  WithSetup(\"deploy kong addon into cluster\", featureSetup(\n    helpers.ControllerManagerOptAdditionalWatchNamespace(\"my-additional-namespace\"),\n  )).\n  ...\n  ```\n\n- In regular integration tests each test gets its own Kubernetes namespace through\n  manual creation via helper functions like:\n\n  ```go\n  ns, cleaner := helpers.Setup(ctx, t, env)\n  ```\n\n  Which will automatically remove the namspace when the test is finished.\n\n  In isolated tests each test's [`Feature`][pkggodev-e2e-framework-feature] will\n  get its own Kubernetes namespace which you can get via:\n\n  ```go\n  namespace := GetNamespaceForT(ctx, t)\n  ```\n\n#### Room for improvement\n\n- Eventually the whole integration suite could be migrated to use this setup.\n  When that happens, we can add logic into setup which would make tests that don't \n  need this level of separation to reuse a common installation of Kong (e.g. to\n  its default - `kong` - namespace).\n\n  This way we'll have the best of both worlds:\n\n  - seprate tests where it's needed\n  - shared, when it's not and where speed is the priority\n\n#### How to run\n\nTests are located under `tests/integration/isolated` and use `integration_tests`\n[build tag][go_build_tag].\n\nYou can run them using one of the dedicated Makefile targets:\n\n- `test.integration.isolated.dbless` run all dbless isolated integration tests with standard\n  verbose output on stderr. The output will also include controllers' logs.\n\nThrough `GOTESTFLAGS` you can specify custom flags that will be passed to `go test`.\nThis can allow you to run a subset of all the tests for faster feedback times, e.g.:\n\n```\nmake test.integration.isolated.dbless GOTESTFLAGS=\"-count 1 -run TestUDPRouteEssentials\"\n```\n\nYou can also specify e2e-framework's flags e.g. to filter tests via [labels][github-e2e-framework-labels].\n\n```\nmake test.integration.isolated.dbless E2E_FRAMEWORK_FLAGS=\"-labels=kind=UDPRoute,example=true\"\n```\n\n[github-e2e-framework]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework\n[github-e2e-framework-labels]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework/tree/main/examples/skip_flags#use-labels-in-your-tests\n[pkggodev-e2e-framework-feature]: https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/e2e-framework/pkg/features\n[ktf]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-testing-framework\n[pkggodev_testmain]: https://pkg.go.dev/testing#hdr-Main\n[integration_test_suite]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/61e06ee64ff913aa9952816121125fca7ed59ba5/test/integration/suite_test.go#L36\n[manager_run]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/5abc699aeee552945a76c82e3f7abb3e1b2fabf1/internal/cmd/rootcmd/run.go#L14-L22\n\n### Kong integration tests\n\nTests located under `test/kongintegration/` allow verifying individual components of KIC\nagainst a running Kong Gateway instance.\n\nEvery test in this package requires a Kong instance to be running, but do not require\na Kubernetes cluster nor a full KIC deployment. Each test is responsible for setting up\nits own Kong instance and cleaning it up after the test is finished. [testcontainers-go]\nis used for that purpose.\n\nExamples of tests that could fit into this category are:\n\n- Ensuring that a component responsible for configuring Kong Gateway works as expected\n- Ensuring that configuration generated by a translator is accepted by Kong Gateway\n\n#### How to run\n\nThe only requirement for running Kong integration tests is to have a docker daemon running.\n\nAll tests can be run using the following Makefile targets:\n\n```shell\n# Verbose output\nmake test.kongintegration\n\n# Pretty output\nmake test.kongintegration.pretty\n```\n\nBy default, `kong:latest` image is used for running Kong Gateway. This can be changed\nby setting the `TEST_KONG_IMAGE` and `TEST_KONG_TAG` environment variables.\n\n#### Potential issues\n\n##### testcontainer's Garbage Collector\n\nIn case your environment doesn't allow running containers in privileged mode, you may encounter\nissues with testcontainer's [garbage collector][testcontainers-gc] (Ryuk) which requires it. In\nMakefile targets we disable the garbage collector by setting `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED` environment\nvariable to `true`.\n\nIf you encounter issues with this while running tests directly (e.g. when debugging\nin an IDE), you can fix it by:\n\n- setting `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED` environment variable to `true` in your IDE configuration,\n- adding `ryuk.disabled=true` to `.testcontainers.properties` file in your home directory (see\n  [Configuration locations][testcontainers-config] for exact locations depending on your OS).\n\n[testcontainers-go]: https://golang.testcontainers.org/\n[testcontainers-config]: https://golang.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/#configuration-locations\n[testcontainers-gc]: https://golang.testcontainers.org/features/garbage_collector/\n\n### End-to-End (E2E) tests\n\nEnd to end tests in KIC are used to test features or use cases which rely on KIC\nbeing deployed in-cluster.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- deploying all in one manifests tested in [all in one tests][test_e2e_all_in_one]\n- upgrade scenarios tested in [upgrade tests][test_e2e_upgrade]\n\nThese tests deploy KIC and Kong Gateway in a cluster using the requested image(s)\nwhich could be customized via dedicated environment variables like:\n\n- [`TEST_KONG_CONTROLLER_IMAGE_OVERRIDE`][env_var_controller_image_override]\n- [`TEST_KONG_IMAGE_OVERRIDE`][env_var_kong_image_override]\n\nOn CI, those are being run both in kind and GKE environments.\n\n#### How to run\n\nE2E tests are located under `tests/e2e/` and use `e2e_tests` [build tag][go_build_tag].\n\nYou can run them using one of the dedicated Makefile targets:\n\n- `test.e2e` run all e2e tests.\n\nThrough `GOTESTFLAGS` you can specify custom flags that will be passed to `go test`.\n\n`E2E_TEST_RUN` is also available to specify the name of the test to run.\nThis is being used in CI where Github Actions' matrix specifies tests to run\nin each workflow.\n\nExemplar local invocation can look like this:\n\n```\nmake test.e2e GOTESTFLAGS=\"-count 1\" E2E_TEST_RUN=TestDeployAllInOneDBLESS\n```\n\n##### Konnect tests\n\nSome of the E2E tests are Konnect-specific and are being run only when the `TEST_KONG_KONNECT_ACCESS_TOKEN`\nenvironment variable is set. You can create the access token using the [Konnect UI][konnect_tokens].\nThe tests run against a `.tech` Konnect environment therefore the token you obtain must be created for an account\nin that environment.\n\nExemplary local invocation for running a Konnect test can look like this:\n\n```\nmake test.e2e GOTESTFLAGS=\"-count 1\" E2E_TEST_RUN=TestKonnectConfigPush TEST_KONG_KONNECT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>\n```\n\n[test_e2e_all_in_one]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/3d45c822bdb907caba568f86062af83406785fc5/test/e2e/all_in_one_test.go\n[test_e2e_upgrade]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/43e797f7394c5f0a9394c6f158f5efff5e2321ec/test/e2e/upgrade_test.go\n[env_var_controller_image_override]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/50a4c3f1e57c56950808b90bcb0b57fefc2f3d7c/test/e2e/environment.go#L12-L13\n[env_var_kong_image_override]: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/50a4c3f1e57c56950808b90bcb0b57fefc2f3d7c/test/e2e/environment.go#L19-L20\n[go_build_tag]: https://pkg.go.dev/go/build#hdr-Build_Constraints\n[konnect_tokens]: https://cloud.konghq.tech/global/account/tokens\n"
