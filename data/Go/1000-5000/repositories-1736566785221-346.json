Add tables from include\n2. Remove tables from exclude\n    - Check for include/exclude overlaps\n    - If include is more specific than exclude (i.e. `schema.MyTable` > `schema.*` or `schema.MyT*` > `schema.*` ), include the table(s). If include is equally or less specific than exclude, exclude wins.\n3. Result\n\n### Comments\n\n`comments:` is used to add table/column comment to database document without `ALTER TABLE`.\n\nFor example, you can add comment about VIEW TABLE or SQLite tables/columns.\n\n``` yaml\n# .tbls.yml\ncomments:\n  -\n    table: users\n    # table comment\n    tableComment: Users table\n    # column comments\n    columnComments:\n      email: Email address as login id. ex. user@example.com\n    # labels for tables\n    labels:\n      - privary data\n      - backup:true\n  -\n    table: post_comments\n    tableComment: post and comments View table\n    columnComments:\n      id: comments.id\n      title: posts.title\n      post_user: posts.users.username\n      comment_user: comments.users.username\n      created: comments.created\n      updated: comments.updated\n  -\n    table: posts\n    # index comments\n    indexComments:\n      posts_user_id_idx: user.id index\n    # constraints comments\n    constraintComments:\n      posts_id_pk: PRIMARY KEY\n    # triggers comments\n    triggerComments:\n      update_posts_updated: Update updated when posts update\n```\n\n### Relations\n\n`relations:` is used to add or override table relation to database document without `FOREIGN KEY`.\n\nYou can create ER diagrams with relations without having foreign key constraints.\n\n``` yaml\nrelations:\n  -\n    table: logs\n    columns:\n      - user_id\n    parentTable: users\n    parentColumns:\n      - id\n    # Relation definition\n    # Default is `Additional Relation`\n    def: logs->users\n  -\n    table: logs\n    columns:\n      - post_id\n    parentTable: posts\n    parentColumns:\n      - id\n  -\n    table: logs\n    columns:\n      - comment_id\n    parentTable: comments\n    parentColumns:\n      - id\n  -\n    table: logs\n    columns:\n      - comment_star_id\n    parentTable: comment_stars\n    parentColumns:\n      - id\n```\n\n![img](sample/mysql/logs.svg)\n\n\n#### Override relations\n\nIf you want to override an existing relation, set the `override:` to `true`.\n\n``` yaml\nrelations:\n  -\n    table: posts\n    columns:\n      - user_id\n    cardinality: zero or one\n    parentTable: users\n    parentColumns:\n      - id\n    parentCardinality: one or more\n    override: true\n    def: posts->users\n```\n\n#### Automatically detect relations\n\n`detectVirtualRelations:` if enabled, automatically detect relations from table and column names.\n\n``` yaml\ndetectVirtualRelations:\n  enabled: true\n  strategy: default\n```\n\n##### Supported strategies\n\n| strategy name                | relation from        | relation to     |\n| :--                          | :--                  | :--             |\n| `default`                    | `some_table.user_id` | `users.id`      |\n| `singularTableName`          | `some_table.user_id` | `user.id`       |\n| `identical`                  | `some_table.user_id` | `users.user_id` |\n| `identicalSingularTableName` | `some_table.user_id` | `user.user_id`  |\n\n\n### Dictionary\n\n`dict:` is used to replace title/table header of database document\n\n``` yaml\n# .tbls.yml\n---\ndict:\n  Tables: „ÉÜ„Éº„Éñ„É´‰∏ÄË¶ß\n  Description: Ê¶ÇË¶Å\n  Columns: „Ç´„É©„É†‰∏ÄË¶ß\n  Indexes: INDEX‰∏ÄË¶ß\n  Constraints: Âà∂Á¥Ñ‰∏ÄË¶ß\n  Triggers: „Éà„É™„Ç¨„Éº\n  Relations: ERÂõ≥\n  Name: ÂêçÂâç\n  Comment: „Ç≥„É°„É≥„Éà\n  Type: „Çø„Ç§„Éó\n  Default: „Éá„Éï„Ç©„É´„ÉàÂÄ§\n  Children: Â≠ê„ÉÜ„Éº„Éñ„É´\n  Parents: Ë¶™„ÉÜ„Éº„Éñ„É´\n  Definition: ÂÆöÁæ©\n  Table Definition: „ÉÜ„Éº„Éñ„É´ÂÆöÁæ©\n```\n\n### Personalized Templates\n\nIt is possible to provide your own templates to personalize the documentation generated by `tbls` by adding a `templates:` section to your configuration.\nFor example:\n\n```yaml\ntemplates:\n  dot:\n    schema: 'templates/schema.dot.tmpl'\n    table: 'templates/table.dot.tmpl'\n  puml:\n    schema: 'templates/schema.puml.tmpl'\n    table: 'templates/table.puml.tmpl'\n  md:\n    index: 'templates/index.md.tmpl'\n    table: 'templates/table.md.tmpl'\n```\n\nA good starting point to design your own template is to modify a copy the default ones for [Dot](output/dot/templates), [PlantUML](output/plantuml/templates) and [markdown](output/md/templates).\n\n### Required Version\n\nThe `requiredVersion` setting defines a version constraint string. This defines which version of tbls can be used in the configuration.\n\n```yaml\nrequiredVersion: '>= 1.42, < 2'\n```\n\n## Expand environment variables\n\nAll configuration values can be set by expanding the environment variables.\n\n``` yaml\n# .tbls.yml\ndsn: my://${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_PASSWORD}@hostname:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE}\n```\n\n### Viewpoints\nViewpoints of your database schema based on concerns of your domain and add description to them.\nYou can also define groups of tables within viewpoints.\n\n``` yaml\n# .tbls.yml\n\nviewpoints:\n  -\n    name: comments on post\n    desc: Users can comment on each post multiple times and put a star on each comment.\n    tables:\n      - users\n      - posts\n      - comments\n      - comment_stars\n      - post_comments\n      - post_comment_stars\n    groups:\n      -\n        name: Comments\n        desc: Tables about comments\n        tables:\n          - posts\n          - comments\n          - post_comments\n      -\n        name: Stars\n        desc: Tables about stars\n        tables:\n          - comment_stars\n          - post_comment_stars\n\n```\n\n## Output formats\n\n`tbls out` output in various formats.\n\n**Markdown:**\n\n``` console\n$ tbls out -t md -o schema.md\n```\n\n**DOT:**\n\n``` console\n$ tbls out -t dot -o schema.dot\n```\n\n**PlantUML:**\n\n``` console\n$ tbls out -t plantuml -o schema.puml\n```\n\n**Mermaid:**\n\n``` console\n$ tbls out -t mermaid -o schema.mmd\n```\n\n**Image (svg, png, jpg):**\n\n``` console\n$ tbls out -t svg --table users --distance 2 -o users.svg\n```\n\n**JSON:**\n\n``` console\n$ tbls out -t json -o schema.json\n```\n\n> **Tips:** `tbls doc` can load `schema.json` as DSN.\n>\n> ``` console\n> $ tbls doc json:///path/to/schema.json\n> ```\n\n**YAML:**\n\n``` console\n$ tbls out -t yaml -o schema.yaml\n```\n\n**Excel:**\n\n``` console\n$ tbls out -t xlsx -o schema.xlsx\n```\n\n**.tbls.yml:**\n\n``` console\n$ tbls out -t config -o .tbls.new.yml\n```\n\n## Command arguments\n\ntbls subcommands ( `doc`,`diff`, etc) accepts arguments and options\n\n``` console\n$ tbls doc my://root:mypass@localhost:3306/testdb doc/schema\n```\n\nYou can check available arguments and options using `tbls help [COMMAND]`.\n\n``` console\n$ tbls help doc\n'tbls doc' analyzes a database and generate document in GitHub Friendly Markdown format.\n\nUsage:\n  tbls doc [DSN] [DOC_PATH] [flags]\n\nFlags:\n  -j, --adjust-table       adjust column width of table\n  -b, --base-url string    base url for links\n  -c, --config string      config file path\n  -t, --er-format string   ER diagrams output format (png, svg, jpg, mermaid). default: svg\n  -f, --force              force\n  -h, --help               help for doc\n      --rm-dist            remove files in docPath before generating documents\n      --sort               sort\n      --when string        command execute condition\n      --without-er         no generate ER diagrams\n```\n\n## Output Schema data\n\n`tbls doc` also output schema data ( `schema.json` ) to same directory as the generated schema document.\n\nTo disable output of schema data, set `disableOutputSchema:` to `true` in `.tbls.yml` file.\n\n## Environment variables\n\ntbls accepts environment variables `TBLS_DSN` and `TBLS_DOC_PATH`\n\n``` console\n$ env TBLS_DSN=my://root:mypass@localhost:3306/testdb TBLS_DOC_PATH=doc/schema tbls doc\n```\n"
