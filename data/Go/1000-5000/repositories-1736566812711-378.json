Please file issues for any bugs you find.\n\n### What is Matcha?\n\nMatcha is a package for building iOS and Android applications and frameworks in\nGo. Matcha provides a UI component library similar to ReactNative and exposes\nbindings to Objective-C and Java code through reflection. The library also\nprovides Go APIs for common app tasks.\n\n### Examples\n\n[![settings-example](docs/settings.gif)](https://github.com/gomatcha/matcha/tree/master/examples/settings)\n[![insta-example](docs/insta.gif)](https://github.com/gomatcha/matcha/tree/master/examples/insta)\n[![todo-example](docs/todo.gif)](https://github.com/gomatcha/matcha/tree/master/examples/todo)\n\n### Installation - macOS\n\nMatcha requires the following components to be installed.\n\n* Go 1.8+\n* Xcode 8.3+\n* Android Studio 2.3+ (with SDK 26, NDK and Android Support)\n\nStart by installing Xcode and Android Studio. Instructions can be found at\nhttps://developer.apple.com/download/ and\nhttps://developer.android.com/studio/install.html.\n\nYou may need to run the following before starting Android Studio to allow it to read\nyour GOPATH (https://stackoverflow.com/a/14285335). This also must be done on\nreboot.\n\n    launchctl setenv GOPATH $GOPATH\n\nOpen Android Studio's SDK Manager and under the SDK Platforms tab, install\nthe Android 8 Platform (API 26). And in the SDK Tools tab, install NDK and the\nAndroid Support Repository.\n\nConfigure the ANDROID_HOME enviromental variable to point to the Android SDK by \nadding the following to your ~/.bash_profile. The Android SDK is \noften located at `~/Library/Android/sdk` depending on your install.\n\n    export ANDROID_HOME=<SDK location>\n\nFetch the project and install the matcha command.\n\n    go get gomatcha.io/matcha/...\n\nNext we build the Go standard library for iOS and Android with the following command.\nThe output is installed at `$GOPATH/pkg/matcha`. If your\npath doesn't contain `$GOPATH/bin`, you may need to replace these calls with\n`$GOPATH/bin/matcha`.\n\n    matcha init\n\nNow build the example project. The output is installed at `$GOPATH/src/gomatcha.io/matcha/ios/MatchaBridge/MatchaBridge/MatchaBridge.a` and `$GOPATH/src/gomatcha.io/matcha/android/matchabridge.aar`.\n\n    matcha build gomatcha.io/matcha/examples\n\nWe can now open the sample iOS project.\n\n    open $GOPATH/src/gomatcha.io/matcha/examples/ios-app/SampleApp.xcworkspace\n    \nSet the Development Team in Xcode under General > Signing and select `SampleApp` in\nthe target dropdown in the upper right. Then run the App!\n\nFor Android, simply open the sample Android Studio project and hit run!\n\n    open -a /Applications/Android\\ Studio.app $GOPATH/src/gomatcha.io/matcha/examples/android-app/SampleApp\n\n### Installation - Linux\n\nMatcha requires the following components to be installed. iOS builds are not\nsupported on Linux.\n\n* Go 1.8+\n* Android Studio 2.3+ (with SDK 26, NDK and Android Support Library)\n\nStart by installing Android Studio. Instructions can be found at\nhttps://developer.android.com/studio/install.html. \n\nOpen Android Studio's SDK Manager and under the SDK Platforms tab, install\nthe Android 8 Platform (API 26). And in the SDK Tools tab, install NDK and the\nAndroid Support Repository.\n\nConfigure the ANDROID_HOME enviromental variable to point to the Android SDK by \nadding the following to your ~/.bash_profile. The Android SDK is often located \nat ~/Android/Sdk depending on your install.\n\n    export ANDROID_HOME=<SDK location>\n\nAdditionally add the following to your ~/.bash_profile to modify your PATH to\ninclude the Java compiler if it does not already. javac can often be found at \n`/usr/local/android-studio/jre/bin`.\n\n    export PATH=${PATH}:<Java Compiler location>\n\nFetch the project and install the matcha command.\n\n    go get gomatcha.io/matcha/...\n\nNext we build the Go standard library for Android with the following command.\nThe output is installed at `$GOPATH/pkg/matcha`. If your\npath doesn't contain `$GOPATH/bin`, you may need to replace these calls with\n`$GOPATH/bin/matcha`.\n\n    matcha init\n\nNow build the example project. The output is installed at `$GOPATH/src/gomatcha.io/matcha/android/matchabridge.aar`.\n\n    matcha build gomatcha.io/matcha/examples\n\nNow open the sample Android Studio project and hit run!\n\n    <Android Studio location>/bin/studio.sh $GOPATH/src/gomatcha.io/matcha/examples/android-app/SampleApp\n\n### Installation - Windows\n\nMatcha requires the following components to be installed. iOS builds are not\nsupported on Windows.\n\n* Go 1.8+\n* Android Studio 2.3+ (with SDK 26, NDK and Android Support Library)\n\nStart by installing Android Studio. Instructions can be found at\nhttps://developer.android.com/studio/install.html. \n\nOpen Android Studio's SDK Manager and under the SDK Platforms tab, install\nthe Android 8 Platform (API 26). And in the SDK Tools tab, install NDK and the\nAndroid Support Repository.\n\nConfigure the ANDROID_HOME enviromental variable to point to the Android SDK.\nThe Android SDK is often located at `%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk` \ndepending on your install. \n\n    setx ANDROID_HOME <SDK location>\n\nModify your PATH to include the Java compiler if it does not already. javac can\noften be found at C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jre\\bin.\n\n    setx PATH %PATH%;<Java Compiler location>\n\nFetch the project and install the matcha command.\n\n    go get gomatcha.io/matcha/...\n\nNext we build the Go standard library for Android with the following command.\nThe output is installed at `$GOPATH/pkg/matcha`. If your path doesn't contain\n`$GOPATH/bin`, you may need to replace these calls with `$GOPATH/bin/matcha`.\n\n    matcha init\n\nNow build the example project. The output is installed at `$GOPATH/src/gomatcha.io/matcha/android/matchabridge.aar`.\n\n    matcha build gomatcha.io/matcha/examples\n\nNow open the sample Android Studio project and hit run!\n\n\n<h3>Try it out!</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://gomatcha.io/guide/installation/\">Install</a> the project</li>\n    <li>Read the <a href=\"https://gomatcha.io/guide/getting-started/\">Getting Started</a> guide</li>\n    <li>Go through some <a href=\"https://github.com/gomatcha/matcha/tree/master/examples\">examples</a></li>\n    <li>Learn the <a href=\"https://gomatcha.io/guide/concepts/\">basic concepts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Contact us</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Join the Gophers <a href=\"https://gophers.slack.com/messages/matcha\">Slack</a> channel</li>\n    <li>Tweet <a href=\"http://twitter.com/gomatchaio\">@gomatcha.io</a> on Twitter</li>\n    <li>Star us on <a href=\"https://github.com/gomatcha/matcha\">GitHub</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"mailto:kevin@gomatcha.io\">Email</a> the team</li>\n</ul>\n"
