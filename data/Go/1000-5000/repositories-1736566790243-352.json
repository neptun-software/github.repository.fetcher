Please note that we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that must be followed when interacting with this project. In addition, please read the guidelines below to ensure that your contributions have a better chance of being accepted.\n\n- [Submitting pull requests](#submitting-pull-requests)\n    - [Code changes](#submitting-pull-requests-for-code-changes)\n    - [Documentation changes](#submitting-pull-requests-for-documentation-changes)\n- [Developing Cerbos](#developing-cerbos)\n- [Getting help](#getting-help)\n\nSubmitting pull requests\n------------------------\n\n- Before submitting a pull request, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos/issues) in the GitHub repository and provide information about the problem you are trying to fix and how you plan to address it. Include as much detail as possible to make it easier for others to understand your thought process.\n- Wait for the project maintainers and other community members to respond to your proposal and clearly agree on a course of action.\n- Create your patch, constraining yourself to what was agreed on the issue. If previously unforeseen problems arise and you have to make significant changes to an area that wasn’t discussed in the issue, make sure to go back to the issue to discuss the new circumstances and get buy-in from the people who are involved.\n- Run the pre-commit checks that are appropriate for the kind of change. (See below for details.)\n- Submit your pull request.\n    - We require all pull requests to follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.\n    - Use [closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) to link the PR to the original issue.\n    - At least one approval from a maintainer is required to merge the pull request.\n\n\n### Submitting pull requests for code changes\n\n- Write idiomatic Go. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) is the canonical source while the [Uber style guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md) contains a lot of good advice as well.\n- Make sure each source file contains the appropriate licence header:\n    ```\n    Copyright 2021-2025 Zenauth Ltd.\n    SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n    ```\n- Add tests to cover the functionality you are adding or modifying.\n- Add new documentation or update existing content to ensure that the documentation stays consistent with the change you are introducing. See [below](#submitting-pull-requests-for-documentation-changes) for tips on writing documentation.\n- Avoid introducing new dependencies if possible. All dependencies must have an appropriate open source licence (Apache-2.0, BSD, MIT).\n- Make sure your code is `gofmt`ed. Run `make lint` and fix any warnings produced by the linter.\n- Sign-off your commits to provide a [DCO](https://developercertificate.org). You can do this by adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` command.\n    ```sh\n    git commit -s -m 'bug: Fix for bug X'\n    ```\n\n### Submitting pull requests for documentation changes\n\n- We use [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/) to write documentation. Please note that some AsciiDoctor features might not be available in [Antora](https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/), the static site generation software we use.\n- Use simple, [inclusive language](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation). Also refer to the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) for general advice on writing good documentation.\n- Do not add third-party content in-line without attribution. Use links where possible.\n- Ensure that any binary assets (images, videos, etc.) are added to [Git LFS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/tree/main/docs).\n- Sign-off your commits to provide a [DCO](https://developercertificate.org). You can do this by adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` command.\n    ```sh\n    git commit -s -m 'bug: Fix for bug X'\n    ```\n\nDeveloping Cerbos\n-----------------\n\nCerbos is developed using the [Go programming language](https://golang.org). Check the `go` directive in the `go.mod` file to find out the minimum version of Go required.\n\n[Just](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html) (a better alternative to `make`) is used as the build scripting system and needs to be installed on the system. Other required build tools are automatically downloaded on demand using the versions defined in `tools/go.mod`.\n\nRun `just` to list all available build targets. Some of the frequently used targets are:\n\n- `just tests`: Run all tests.\n- `just build`: Compile, test and build the Cerbos binaries and container. Binaries will be output to the `dist` directory. The container name would be `ghcr.io/cerbos/cerbos:<VERSION>-prerelease`.\n- `just pre-commit`: Run tests, lint, and generate code and documentation. Run this before submitting a PR to make sure your code is ready to submit.\n- `just dev-server`: Start a Cerbos server. Alternatively, use `just cerbos [ARGS]` or `just cerbosctl [ARGS]` to launch Cerbos or Cerbosctl from source.\n- `just docs`: Generate docs and preview in browser.\n\n\nGetting Help\n------------\n\n- [Read the documentation](https://docs.cerbos.dev)\n- Post a question in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos/discussions)\n- Join our [Slack community](http://go.cerbos.io/slack)\n- Email us at help@cerbos.dev\n- Visit our website at https://cerbos.dev\n"

Litigation\n-------------\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\nsteward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\nsuch modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\nLicenses\n\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\nSecondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\nnotice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n-------------------------------------------\n\n  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n  License, v. 2.0.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It enables you to define powerful, context-aware access control rules for your application resources in simple, intuitive YAML policies; managed and deployed via your Git-ops infrastructure. It provides highly available APIs to make simple requests to evaluate policies and make dynamic access decisions for your application.\n\nThis repo has everything you need to set up a self-hosted Cerbos Policy Decision Point (PDP). [Sign up for a free Cerbos Hub account](https://cerbos.dev/product-cerbos-hub?utm_campaign=brand_cerbos&utm_source=github) to streamline your policy authoring and distribution workflow to self-hosted PDPs.\n\nWith Cerbos Hub you can:\n\n- Collaborate with colleagues to author and share policies in fully-interactive private playgrounds\n- Quickly and efficiently distribute policy updates to your whole PDP fleet\n- Build special policy bundles for client-side or in-browser authorization\n- Easily integrate with Cerbos in serverless and edge deployments\n\n## Key concepts, at a glance 👀\n\n**_PRINCIPAL:_** oftentimes just the \"user\", but can also represent: other applications, services, bots or anything you can think of. The \"thing\" that's trying to carry out an... ↙️\n\n**_ACTION:_** a specific task. Whether to create, view, update, delete, acknowledge, approve... anything. The principal might have permission to do all actions or maybe just one or two. The actions are carried out on a... ↙️\n\n**_RESOURCE:_** the thing you're controlling access to. It could be anything, e.g., in an expense management system; reports, receipts, card details, payment records, etc. You define resources in Cerbos by writing... ↙️\n\n**_POLICIES:_** YAML files where you define the access rules for each resource, following a [simple, structured format](#resource-policy). Stored either: [on disk](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/configuration/storage.html#disk-driver), in [cloud object stores](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/configuration/storage.html#blob-driver), [git repos](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/configuration/storage.html#git-driver), or dynamically in [supported databases](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/configuration/storage.html#sqlite3). These are continually monitored by the... ↙️\n\n**_CERBOS PDP:_** the Policy Decision Point: the stateless service where policies are executed and decisions are made. This runs as a separate process in kube (as a [service](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/deployment/k8s-service.html) or a [sidecar](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/deployment/k8s-sidecar.html)), directly as a [systemd service](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/deployment/systemd.html) or as an [AWS Lambda function](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/deployment/serverless-faas.html). Once deployed, the PDP provides two primary APIs...\n\n* **_CheckResources:_** \"Can this principal access this resource?\"\n* **_PlanResources:_** \"Which of resource kind=X can this principal access?\"\n\nThese APIs can be called via [cURL](#api-request), or in production via one of our many... ↙️\n\n**_SDKs:_** you can see the list [here](#client-sdks). There are also a growing number of [query plan adapters](#query-plan-adapters) to convert the SDK `PlanResources` responses to a convenient query instance.\n\n**_RBAC -> ABAC:_** If simple RBAC doesn't cut it, you can extend the decision-making by implementing attribute based rules. Implement `conditions` in your resource policies which are evaluated dynamically at runtime using contextual data, for much more granular control. Add conditions in [derived roles](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/policies/derived_roles.html) to extend the RBAC roles dynamically. Or use [principal policies](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/policies/principal_policies.html) for more particular overrides for a specific user.\n\n**_CERBOS HUB:_** A cloud-hosted control plane to streamline your Cerbos PDP deployment.
