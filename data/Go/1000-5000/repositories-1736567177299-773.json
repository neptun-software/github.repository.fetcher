负责长连接维护，消息投递，消息高效存储等等\n\n`业务层`(TangSengDaoDao)： 负责一些业务逻辑，比如：好友关系，群组，朋友圈等等，一些IM相关的业务层的逻辑\n\n`通讯层与业务层`： WuKongIM会将一些业务层需要的聊天相关的数据通过Webhook的机制（GRPC）推送给TangSengDaoDao，TangSengDaoDao需要投递一些系统消息时，将调用WuKongIM的发送消息的API进行投递。\n\n`客户端与服务端`： 客户端通过SDK与WuKongIM建立长连接，发送消息和收消息都将通过长连接进行传输，客户端的一些业务逻辑，比如：好友关系，群组，朋友圈等等，将通过调用TangSengDaoDao的API进行处理。\n\n\n相关源码\n------------\n\n\n### 唐僧叨叨（负责业务）\n\n| 项目名 | Github地址 | Gitee地址 | 文档 | 说明 |\n| ---- |
