We appreciate your help!\n\nHere are instructions to get you started. They are probably not perfect, please let us know if anything feels wrong or incomplete\n\n## Contribution guidelines\n\n### Pull requests\nThis repository Pull Request only support develop branch\n\nFirst of all. awesome-golang-algorithm follow the gitflow. So please send you pull request to develop branch. We will close the pull request to master branch.\n\nWe are always happy to receive pull requests and do our best to review them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.\n\nIf your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! Sometimes we can make a mistake, please do more explaining for us. We will appreciate it.\n\nWe're trying very hard to keep awesome-golang-algorithm simple and fast. We don't want it to do everything for everybody. This means that we might decide against incorporating a new feature. But we will give you some advice on how to do it in another way.\n\n#### Standard Process\n\n- 1.Fork the Repositories [awesome-golang-algorithm][Repositories-URL]\n- 2.Check out the branch to develop\n- 3.Find the LeetCode problem directory. if the directory doesn't exist you can copy  [src/0000.Demo] and rename it to Standard\n- 4.Write your code int the Solution.go and copy the official test cases in the Solution_test.go\n- 5.Update the README.MD file. if you want\n- 6.Update the README.md. if you want you to add some images you can add the file to `assets\\images`\n- 7.At the end don't forget to run the test.sh scripts in order to keep the CI success running\n- 8.Commit your update and make a Pull Request\n\n\n\n### Create issues\n\nAny significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it.\n\nAlso when filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:\n\n- What operating system and processor architecture are you using?\n- What did you do?\n- What did you expect to see?\n- What did you see instead?\n\n[Repositories-URL]: https://github.com/kylesliu/awesome-golang-algorithm"
