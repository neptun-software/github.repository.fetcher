Do not use other bitmap compression methods ([Wang et al., SIGMOD 2017](http://db.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sidm338-wangA.pdf))\n\n\nThe ``roaring`` Go library is used by\n* [anacrolix/torrent]\n* [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com)\n* [Pilosa](https://www.pilosa.com/)\n* [Bleve](http://www.blevesearch.com)\n* [Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)\n* [lindb](https://github.com/lindb/lindb)\n* [Elasticell](https://github.com/deepfabric/elasticell)\n* [SourceGraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph)\n* [M3](https://github.com/m3db/m3)\n* [trident](https://github.com/NetApp/trident)\n* [Husky](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-husky/)\n* [FrostDB](https://github.com/polarsignals/frostdb)\n\nThis library is used in production in several systems, it is part of the [Awesome Go collection](https://awesome-go.com).\n\n\nThere are also  [Java](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap) and [C/C++](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring) versions.  The Java, C, C++ and Go version are binary compatible: e.g,  you can save bitmaps\nfrom a Java program and load them back in Go, and vice versa. We have a [format specification](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringFormatSpec).\n\n\nThis code is licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0 (ASL2.0).\n\nCopyright 2016-... by the authors.\n\nWhen should you use a bitmap?\n===================================\n\n\nSets are a fundamental abstraction in\nsoftware. They can be implemented in various\nways, as hash sets, as trees, and so forth.\nIn databases and search engines, sets are often an integral\npart of indexes. For example, we may need to maintain a set\nof all documents or rows  (represented by numerical identifier)\nthat satisfy some property. Besides adding or removing\nelements from the set, we need fast functions\nto compute the intersection, the union, the difference between sets, and so on.\n\n\nTo implement a set\nof integers, a particularly appealing strategy is the\nbitmap (also called bitset or bit vector). Using n bits,\nwe can represent any set made of the integers from the range\n[0,n): the ith bit is set to one if integer i is present in the set.\nCommodity processors use words of W=32 or W=64 bits. By combining many such words, we can\nsupport large values of n. Intersections, unions and differences can then be implemented\n as bitwise AND, OR and ANDNOT operations.\nMore complicated set functions can also be implemented as bitwise operations.\n\nWhen the bitset approach is applicable, it can be orders of\nmagnitude faster than other possible implementation of a set (e.g., as a hash set)\nwhile using several times less memory.\n\nHowever, a bitset, even a compressed one is not always applicable. For example, if\nyou have 1000 random-looking integers, then a simple array might be the best representation.\nWe refer to this case as the \"sparse\" scenario.\n\nWhen should you use compressed bitmaps?\n===================================\n\nAn uncompressed BitSet can use a lot of memory. For example, if you take a BitSet\nand set the bit at position 1,000,000 to true and you have just over 100kB. That is over 100kB\nto store the position of one bit. This is wasteful  even if you do not care about memory:\nsuppose that you need to compute the intersection between this BitSet and another one\nthat has a bit at position 1,000,001 to true, then you need to go through all these zeroes,\nwhether you like it or not. That can become very wasteful.\n\nThis being said, there are definitively cases where attempting to use compressed bitmaps is wasteful.\nFor example, if you have a small universe size. E.g., your bitmaps represent sets of integers\nfrom [0,n) where n is small (e.g., n=64 or n=128). If you can use uncompressed BitSet and\nit does not blow up your memory usage,  then compressed bitmaps are probably not useful\nto you. In fact, if you do not need compression, then a BitSet offers remarkable speed.\n\nThe sparse scenario is another use case where compressed bitmaps should not be used.\nKeep in mind that random-looking data is usually not compressible. E.g., if you have a small set of\n32-bit random integers, it is not mathematically possible to use far less than 32 bits per integer,\nand attempts at compression can be counterproductive.\n\nHow does Roaring compares with the alternatives?\n==================================================\n\n\nMost alternatives to Roaring are part of a larger family of compressed bitmaps that are run-length-encoded\nbitmaps. They identify long runs of 1s or 0s and they represent them with a marker word.\nIf you have a local mix of 1s and 0, you use an uncompressed word.\n\nThere are many formats in this family:\n\n* Oracle's BBC is an obsolete format at this point: though it may provide good compression,\nit is likely much slower than more recent alternatives due to excessive branching.\n* WAH is a patented variation on BBC that provides better performance.\n* Concise is a variation on the patented WAH. It some specific instances, it can compress\nmuch better than WAH (up to 2x better), but it is generally slower.\n* EWAH is both free of patent, and it is faster than all the above. On the downside, it\ndoes not compress quite as well. It is faster because it allows some form of \"skipping\"\nover uncompressed words. So though none of these formats are great at random access, EWAH\nis better than the alternatives.\n\n\n\nThere is a big problem with these formats however that can hurt you badly in some cases: there is no random access. If you want to check whether a given value is present in the set, you have to start from the beginning and \"uncompress\" the whole thing. This means that if you want to intersect a big set with a large set, you still have to uncompress the whole big set in the worst case...\n\nRoaring solves this problem. It works in the following manner. It divides the data into chunks of 2<sup>16</sup> integers\n(e.g., [0, 2<sup>16</sup>), [2<sup>16</sup>, 2 x 2<sup>16</sup>), ...). Within a chunk, it can use an uncompressed bitmap, a simple list of integers,\nor a list of runs. Whatever format it uses, they all allow you to check for the presence of any one value quickly\n(e.g., with a binary search). The net result is that Roaring can compute many operations much faster than run-length-encoded\nformats like WAH, EWAH, Concise... Maybe surprisingly, Roaring also generally offers better compression ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\n- Daniel Lemire, Owen Kaser, Nathan Kurz, Luca Deri, Chris O'Hara, François Saint-Jacques, Gregory Ssi-Yan-Kai, Roaring Bitmaps: Implementation of an Optimized Software Library, Software: Practice and Experience 48 (4), 2018 [arXiv:1709.07821](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07821)\n-  Samy Chambi, Daniel Lemire, Owen Kaser, Robert Godin,\nBetter bitmap performance with Roaring bitmaps,\nSoftware: Practice and Experience 46 (5), 2016.[arXiv:1402.6407](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6407) This paper used data from http://lemire.me/data/realroaring2014.html\n- Daniel Lemire, Gregory Ssi-Yan-Kai, Owen Kaser, Consistently faster and smaller compressed bitmaps with Roaring, Software: Practice and Experience 46 (11), 2016.

You can call\n``BoundSerializedSizeInBytes`` for a more precise estimate.\n\n### 64-bit Roaring\n\nBy default, roaring is used to stored unsigned 32-bit integers. However, we also offer\nan extension dedicated to 64-bit integers. It supports roughly the same functions:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"github.com/RoaringBitmap/roaring/v2/roaring64\"\n    \"bytes\"\n)\n\n\nfunc main() {\n    // example inspired by https://github.com/fzandona/goroar\n    fmt.Println(\"==roaring64==\")\n    rb1 := roaring64.BitmapOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100, 1000)\n    fmt.Println(rb1.String())\n\n    rb2 := roaring64.BitmapOf(3, 4, 1000)\n    fmt.Println(rb2.String())\n\n    rb3 := roaring64.New()\n    fmt.Println(rb3.String())\n\n    fmt.Println(\"Cardinality: \", rb1.GetCardinality())\n\n    fmt.Println(\"Contains 3? \", rb1.Contains(3))\n\n    rb1.And(rb2)\n\n    rb3.Add(1)\n    rb3.Add(5)\n\n    rb3.Or(rb1)\n\n\n\n    // prints 1, 3, 4, 5, 1000\n    i := rb3.Iterator()\n    for i.HasNext() {\n        fmt.Println(i.Next())\n    }\n    fmt.Println()\n\n    // next we include an example of serialization\n    buf := new(bytes.Buffer)\n    rb1.WriteTo(buf) // we omit error handling\n    newrb:= roaring64.New()\n    newrb.ReadFrom(buf)\n    if rb1.Equals(newrb) {\n    \tfmt.Println(\"I wrote the content to a byte stream and read it back.\")\n    }\n    // you can iterate over bitmaps using ReverseIterator(), Iterator, ManyIterator()\n}\n```\n\nOnly the 32-bit roaring format is standard and cross-operable between Java, C++, C and Go. There is no guarantee that the 64-bit versions are compatible.\n\n### Documentation\n\nCurrent documentation is available at https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/RoaringBitmap/roaring and https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/RoaringBitmap/roaring/roaring64\n\n### Goroutine safety\n\nIn general, it should not generally be considered safe to access\nthe same bitmaps using different goroutines--they are left\nunsynchronized for performance. Should you want to access\na Bitmap from more than one goroutine, you should\nprovide synchronization. Typically this is done by using channels to pass\nthe *Bitmap around (in Go style; so there is only ever one owner),\nor by using `sync.Mutex` to serialize operations on Bitmaps.\n\n### Coverage\n\nWe test our software. For a report on our test coverage, see\n\nhttps://coveralls.io/github/RoaringBitmap/roaring?branch=master\n\n### Benchmark\n\nType\n\n         go test -bench Benchmark -run -\n\nTo run benchmarks on [Real Roaring Datasets](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/real-roaring-datasets)\nrun the following:\n\n```sh\ngo get github.com/RoaringBitmap/real-roaring-datasets\nBENCH_REAL_DATA=1 go test -bench BenchmarkRealData -run -\n```\n\n### Iterative use\n\nYou can use roaring with gore:\n\n- go install github.com/x-motemen/gore/cmd/gore@latest\n- Make sure that ``$GOPATH/bin`` is in your ``$PATH``.\n\n```go\n$ gore\ngore version 0.2.6  :help for help\ngore> :import github.com/RoaringBitmap/roaring\ngore> x:=roaring.New()\ngore> x.Add(1)\ngore> x.String()\n\"{1}\"\n```\n\n\n### Fuzzy testing\n\nYou can help us test further the library with fuzzy testing:\n\n         go get github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/go-fuzz\n         go get github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/go-fuzz-build\n         go test -tags=gofuzz -run=TestGenerateSmatCorpus\n         go-fuzz-build github.com/RoaringBitmap/roaring\n         go-fuzz -bin=./roaring-fuzz.zip -workdir=workdir/ -timeout=200 -func FuzzSmat\n\nLet it run, and if the # of crashers is > 0, check out the reports in\nthe workdir where you should be able to find the panic goroutine stack\ntraces.\n\nYou may also replace `-func FuzzSmat`  by `-func FuzzSerializationBuffer` or `-func FuzzSerializationStream`.\n\n### Alternative in Go\n\nThere is a Go version wrapping the C/C++ implementation https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/gocroaring\n\nFor an alternative implementation in Go, see https://github.com/fzandona/goroar\nThe two versions were written independently.\n\n\n### Mailing list/discussion group\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/roaring-bitmaps\n"

It is\n// inspired by the concept of lazy evaluation\n// you might be familiar with (functional programming\n// and all that). So a roaring bitmap is\n// such that all its containers are, in some\n// sense, chosen to use as little memory as\n// possible. This is nice. Also, all bitsets\n// are \"cardinality aware\" so that you can do\n// fast rank/select queries, or query the\n// cardinality of the whole bitmap... very fast,\n// without latency.\n//\n// However, imagine that you are aggregating 100\n// bitmaps together. So you OR the first two, then OR\n// that with the third one and so forth. Clearly,\n// intermediate bitmaps don't need to be as\n// compressed as possible, right? They can be\n// in a \"dirty state\".
