We hope that this\ndocument helps you get started.\n\n## Policies\n\nThis repository adheres to the following project policies:\n\n- [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct] - How we should act with each other.\n- [Contributing][contributing] - General contributing standards.\n- [Security][security] - Reporting security concerns.\n- [Support][support] - Getting support.\n\n## Contributing to this repository\n\n### Development\n\nAside from the policies above, you may find [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) to provide specific helpful detail\nto assist you while developing in this repository.\n\nWe welcome any and all contributions! The issues we are prioritizing are visible in the repository [milestones](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/milestones), and we especially welcome contributions to that. One good place to start contributing is in our [documentation](https://github.com/buildpacks/docs/issues), though you are welcome to start in this repository!\n\n#### Preparing for a Pull Request\n\nAfter making all the changes but before creating a [Pull Request][pull-request-process], you should run\n`make prepare-for-pr`. This command runs a set of other tasks that resolve or report any simple issues that would\notherwise arise during the pull request review process.\n\n### User Acceptance on a Pull Request\n\nRunning user acceptance on a pull request is just as critical as reviewing the code changes. It allows you, a contributor and user, direct insight into how a feature works and allows for you to provide feedback into what could be improved.\n\n#### Downloading PR binaries\n\n1. On GitHub's Pull Request view, click on the **Checks** tab.\n2. On the left panel, click on the **build** step.\n3. On the bottom, there is **Artifacts** section.\n4. Click on the zip file for the platform you are running.\n\n#### Setup\n\n1. Unzip binary:\n    ```shell\n    unzip pack-{{PLATFORM}}.zip\n    ```\n2. Enable execution of binary _(macOS/Linux only)_:\n    ```shell\n    chmod +x ./pack\n    ```\n\n    > For macOS, you might need to allow your terminal to be able to execute applications from unverified developers. See [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491).\n    > \n    > A quick solution is to add exception to the downloaded pack binary: `sudo spctl --add -v ./pack`\n3. You should now be able to execute pack via:\n    - macOS: `./pack`\n    - Linux: `./pack`\n    - Windows: `pack.exe`\n\n\n#### Writing Feedback\n\nWhen providing feedback please provide a succinct title, a summary of the observation, what you expected, and some output or screenshots.\n\nHere's a simple template you can use:\n\n```text\n\n#### <!-- title -->\n\n<!-- a summary of what you observed -->\n\n###### Expected\n\n<!-- describe what you expected -->\n\n###### Output\n\n<!-- output / logs / screenshots -->\n```\n\n\n[code-of-conduct]: https://github.com/buildpacks/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[contributing]: https://github.com/buildpacks/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[security]: https://github.com/buildpacks/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md\n[support]: https://github.com/buildpacks/.github/blob/main/SUPPORT.md\n[pull-request-process]: https://github.com/buildpacks/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTIONS.md#pull-request-process\n"

On Windows, this requires the [permission to be provided](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24353758).\n\n### Testing GitHub actions on forks\n\nThe pack release process involves chaining a series of GitHub actions together, such as:\n* The \"build\" workflow, which creates:\n    * .tgz files containing the pack binaries and shasums for the .tgz files\n    * a draft release with the above artifacts\n* The \"delivery-docker\" workflow, which builds and pushes OCI images containing the pack binary\n* The \"benchmark\" workflow, which runs performance checks for each commit and uploads reports to GitHub Pages\n\nIt can be rather cumbersome to test changes to these workflows, as they are heavily intertwined. Thus, we recommend forking the buildpacks/pack repository on GitHub and running through the entire release process end-to-end.\n\nFor the fork, it is necessary to complete the following preparations:\n\n* Add the following secrets:\n    * `DOCKER_PASSWORD` for the delivery-docker workflow, if not using ghcr.io\n    * `DOCKER_USERNAME` for the delivery-docker workflow, if not using ghcr.io\n    * `DEPLOY_KEY` for the release-merge workflow, as a SSH private key for repository access\n* Enable the issues feature on the repository and create `status/triage` and `type/bug` labels for the check-latest-release workflow\n* Create a branch named `gh-pages` for uploading benchmark reports for the benchmark workflow\n\nThe `tools/test-fork.sh` script can be used to update the source code to reflect the state of the fork and disable workflows that should not run on the fork repository.\nIt can be invoked like so: `./tools/test-fork.sh <registry repo name>`\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Building\n\nTo build pack:\n```\nmake build\n```\n\nThis will output the binary to the directory `out/`.\n\nOptions:\n\n| ENV_VAR      | Description                                                            | Default |\n|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| GOCMD        | Change the `go` executable.

They communicate the release status to the working group meetings, schedule additional meetings with the `pack` [maintainers][maintainers] as needed, and finalize the release. They also take care of whatever release needs may arise.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Development\n\nOur development flow is detailed in [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md).\n\n### Feature Complete\n\n5 business days prior to a scheduled release, we enter `feature complete`.\n\nDuring this period, a **Release Candidate** (RC) is published and used for further User Acceptance testing (`UAT`). Furthermore, additional RCs may be published based on assessment by the `pack` [maintainers][maintainers] of the **impact**, **effort** and **risk** of including the changes in the upcoming release. Any other changes may be merged into the `main` branch through the normal process, and will make it into the next release.\n\nTo produce the release candidate the [release manager](#release-manager) will:\n- Create a new release branch in form `release/<VERSION>-rc<NUMBER>` yielding a draft GitHub release to be published. \n- Publish the [GitHub release][release]:\n    - Tag release branch as `v<VERSION>-rc<NUMBER>`.\n    - Release should be marked as \"pre-release\".\n    - The GitHub release will contain the following:\n        - **artifacts**\n        - **release notes**\n    - The release notes should be edited and cleaned\n- Merge the release branch into `main`.\n\n### Release Finalization\n\nThe [release manager](#release-manager) will:\n- Create a new release branch in form `release/<VERSION>` yielding a draft GitHub release to be published. \n- Publish the [GitHub release][release] while tagging the release branch as `v<VERSION>`.\n    - Tag release branch as `v<VERSION>`.\n    - The GitHub release will contain the following:\n        - **artifacts**\n        - **release notes**\n        - **migration guide** (if necessary)\n- Merge the release branch into `main`.\n- Create a new [milestone](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/milestones) for the next version, and set the delivery time in 6 weeks.\n- Move all still open PRs/issues in the delivered milestone to the new milestone\n- Close the delivered milestone\n- Send out release notifications, if deemed necessary, on\n  - The [cncf-buildpacks mailing list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-buildpacks)\n  - Twitter\n- Post release, you should be able to remove any acceptance test constraints (in [acceptance/invoke/pack.go](acceptance/invoke/pack.go)) in the `featureTests` struct. Create a PR removing them, in order to ensure our acceptance tests are clean.\n\nAnd with that, you're done!\n\n## Manual Releasing\n\nWe release pack to a number of systems, including `homebrew`, `docker`, and `archlinux`. All of our delivery pipelines\nhave workflow_dispatch triggers, if a maintainer needs to manually trigger them. To activate it, go to the\n[actions page](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/actions), and select the desired workflow. Run it by providing the pack\nversion to release, in the format `v<version>`.\n\n_For more information, see the [release process RFC][release-process]_\n\n[maintainers]: https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/main/TEAMS.md#platform-team\n[release-process]: https://github.com/buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0039-release-process.md#change-control-board\n[release]: https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/releases\n"
