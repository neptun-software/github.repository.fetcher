(General Guidelines)\n\nThere are multiple ways to contribute to Space Cloud:\n- Code contributions.\n  - Looking for a starting point? Search for issues with the labels [good first issue](https://github.com/spaceuptech/space-cloud/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [help wanted](https://github.com/spaceuptech/space-cloud/labels/help%20wanted).\n- Creating well-described issues with reproducible steps.\n- Community contributions (making examples, tutorials, spreading the word, or sending out [this tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=&text=Hey%2C%20I%20just%20found%20a%20cool%20open%20source%20alternative%20for%20Firebase%20and%20Heroku.%20It's%20%40SpaceUpTech's%20%23SpaceCloud.%20Check%20it%20out%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fspaceuptech%2Fspace-cloud)).\n- Contributing to discussions and offering your views and feedback on community calls.\n\n- Every PR should be attached to an issue. If your contribution doesn't align with an existing issue, create a new issue and link it with your PR.\n- Space Cloud's [motivation](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/introduction/motivation/) and [design goals](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/introduction/design-goals/) are the driving factors for feature ideas.\n\n> If you are confused about where to start, which issue to pick or how to solve one, we welcome your questions in the [#contributions channel](https://discord.gg/sWdSk6m) on Discord.\n\n## Sign the CLA\n### Before your PRs can be merged, you need to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/spaceuptech/space-cloud).\n\n## Project Structure\n\n- The core components of Space Cloud are `gateway`, `runner` and `space-cli`.\n- The codebase is a monorepo consisting of the core components and their sub modules.\n\n## Branching Strategy and Guidelines\n\n- Space Cloud follows a version and release based branching practice. Active development happens on the version branches starting with the prefix `v`.\n- For creating a PR, you should create a fork from the latest version branch. Avoid creating forks from master because a version release might force you to rebase your commits."

CockroachDB, Yugabyte, etc.)\n- **MySQL** and MySQL compatible databases (For eg. TiDB, MariaDB, etc.)\n- **SQL Server**\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Client-side tooling](#client-side-tooling)\n- [How it works](#how-it-works)\n- [Support & Troubleshooting](#support--troubleshooting)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Quick start\n\n> **If you are new to Space Cloud, we strongly recommend following our [step-by-step guide](https://learn.spaceuptech.com/space-cloud/basics/setup/) to get started**\n\n### Other guides\n\nView the installation guides for [Docker](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/install/docker) and [Kubernetes](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/install/kubernetes).\n\n## Client-side tooling\nSpace Cloud exposes GraphQL and REST APIs. See [setting up project](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/introduction/setting-up-project) guide to choose a client and set it up. \n\n### GraphQL APIs\nGraphQL is the recommended way to use Space cloud, and it works with any GraphQL client. However, we recommend using [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client). See [awesome-graphql](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql) for a list of clients.\n\n### REST APIs\n\nYou can use the [REST APIs of Space Cloud](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/YourTechBud/space-cloud/0.15.0) if you are more comfortable with REST. \n\nTo make it easy to consume the REST APIs in web projects, we have created a [**Javascript SDK**](https://docs.spaceuptech.com/introduction/setting-up-project/javascript) for you.\n\n## How it works\n\nSpace Cloud is meant to replace any backend php, nodejs, java code you may write to create your endpoints. Instead, it _exposes your database over an external API_ that can be consumed directly from the frontend. In other words, it **allows clients to fire database queries directly**.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that **the client does not send database (SQL) queries** to Space Cloud. Instead, it sends an object describing the query to be executed. This object is first **validated** by Space Cloud (using security rules). Once the client is authorized to make the request, **a database query is dynamically generated and executed**. The results are sent directly to the concerned client.\n\nWe understand that not every app can be built using only CRUD operations. Sometimes it's necessary to write business logic. For such cases, Space Cloud allows you to access your **custom HTTP servers** via the same consistent APIs of Space Cloud.  In this scenario, Space Cloud acts merely as an API gateway between your `services` and the client. However, the cool part is that you can even perform **joins on your microservices and database** via the GraphQL API of Space Cloud.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n<img src=\"https://space-cloud.io/images/graphQL-diagram.svg\"  style=\"max-width: 80%\" alt=\"Detailed Space Cloud architecture\" />\n</div>\n\nSpace Cloud integrates with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Istio](https://istio.io) natively to bring to you a highly scalable Serverless Platform. It encrypts all traffic by default and lets you describe communication policies to protect your microservices.\n\nWith that, it also provides **autoscaling functionality** out of the box including **scaling down to zero**.\n\n## Support & Troubleshooting\n\nThe documentation and community should help you troubleshoot most issues. If you have encountered a bug or need to get in touch with us, you can contact us using one of the following channels:\n\n- Support & feedback: [Discord](https://discord.gg/RkGjW93)\n- Issue & bug tracking: [GitHub issues](https://github.com/spacecloud-io/space-cloud/issues)\n- Follow product updates: [@spaceupcloudio](https://twitter.com/spacecloudio)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSpace Cloud is a young project.
