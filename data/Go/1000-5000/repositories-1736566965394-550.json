Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time.

Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within\nthe community.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.0, available at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct\nenforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

It allows you to quickly install\nand switch between different environment you need via the command line.\n\n## Why use vfox?\n\n- **cross-platform support** (**Windows**, Linux, macOS)\n- **consistent commands** to manage all your languages\n- supports **different versions for different projects, different shells, and globally**.\n- simple **plugin system** to add support for your runtime of choice\n- **automatically switches** runtime versions as you traverse your project\n- support for existing config files `.node-version`, `.nvmrc`, `.sdkmanrc` for easy migration\n- shell completion available for common shells (Bash, ZSH, Powershell, Clink)\n- **it's faster than `asdf-vm`, and offers more simple commands and genuine cross-platform unification.**\n  see [Comparison with asdf](https://vfox.lhan.me/misc/vs-asdf.html)\n\n## Demo\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/650100.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/650100)\n\n## Quickstart\n\n> For detailed installation instructions, see [Quick Start](https://vfox.lhan.me/guides/quick-start.html)\n\n#### 1. Choose an [installation](https://vfox.lhan.me/guides/quick-start.html#_1-installation) that works for you.\n\n#### 2. ⚠️ **_Hook `vfox` into your shell_ (pick one that works for your shell)** ⚠️\n\n```bash\necho 'eval \"$(vfox activate bash)\"' >> ~/.bashrc\necho 'eval \"$(vfox activate zsh)\"' >> ~/.zshrc\necho 'vfox activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n\n# For PowerShell:\nif (-not (Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) { New-Item -Type File -Path $PROFILE -Force }; Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value 'Invoke-Expression \"$(vfox activate pwsh)\"'\n\n# For Clink:\n# 1. Install clink: https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/releases\n#    Or Install cmder: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases\n# 2. Find script path: clink info | findstr scripts\n# 3. copy internal/shell/clink_vfox.lua to script path\n```\n\n> Remember to restart your shell to apply the changes.\n\n#### 3. Add an SDK plugin\n```bash \n$ vfox add nodejs\n```\n\n#### 4. Install a runtime\n\n```bash\n$ vfox install nodejs@21.5.0\n```\n\n#### 5. Switch runtime\n\n```bash\n$ vfox use nodejs@21.5.0\n$ node -v\n21.5.0\n```\n\n## Full Documentation\n\nSee [vfox.lhan.me](https://vfox.lhan.me) for full documentation.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nOur future plans and high priority features and enhancements are:\n\n- [x] Refactoring the plugin mechanism:\n  - Introducing plugin templates to facilitate multi-file plugin development.\n  - Establishing a global registry (similar to `NPM Registry` or `Scoop Main Bucket`) to provide a unified entry point for plugin distribution.\n  - Decomposing the existing plugin repository into individual repositories, one for each plugin.\n- [X] Allowing the switching of registry addresses.\n- [X] Plugin capabilities: Parsing legacy configuration files, such as `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `.sdkmanrc`, etc.\n- [ ] Plugin capabilities: Allowing plugins to load installed runtimes and provide information about the runtime.\n\n## Available Plugins\n\n> If you have installed `vfox`, you can view all available plugins with the `vfox available` command.\n\nFor more details, see the [Available Plugins](https://vfox.lhan.me/plugins/available.html).\n\n## Contributors\n\n> Thanks to following people who contributed to this project. 🎉🎉🙏🙏\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/version-fox/vfox/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=version-fox/vfox\" />\n</a>\n\n## Contributing\n\nBug reports, contributions and forks are welcome.
