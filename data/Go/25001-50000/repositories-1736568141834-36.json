Installation\n\n在项目目录下通过如下命令安装：\n\n```shell\nGO111MODULE=on GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn/,direct go get -u github.com/zeromicro/go-zero\n```\n\n## 6. Quick Start\n\n0. 完整示例请查看\n\n    [快速构建高并发微服务](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/doc/shorturl.md)\n\n    [快速构建高并发微服务 - 多 RPC 版](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/docs/zero/bookstore.md)\n\n1. 安装 goctl 工具\n\n    `goctl` 读作 `go control`，不要读成 `go C-T-L`。`goctl` 的意思是不要被代码控制，而是要去控制它。其中的 `go` 不是指 `golang`。在设计 `goctl` 之初，我就希望通过 `工具` 来解放我们的双手👈\n\n    ```shell\n    # Go\n    GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn/,direct go install github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/tools/goctl@latest\n    \n    # For Mac\n    brew install goctl\n    \n    # docker for all platforms\n    docker pull kevinwan/goctl\n    # run goctl\n    docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/app kevinwan/goctl --help\n    ```\n    \n    确保 goctl 可执行，并且在 $PATH 环境变量里。\n    \n2. 快速生成 api 服务\n\n    ```shell\n    goctl api new greet\n    cd greet\n    go mod tidy\n    go run greet.go -f etc/greet-api.yaml\n    ```\n\n    默认侦听在 `8888` 端口（可以在配置文件里修改），可以通过 `curl` 请求：\n\n    ```shell\n    curl -i http://localhost:8888/from/you\n    ```\n\n    返回如下：\n\n    ```http\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    Content-Type: application/json\n    Date: Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:03:18 GMT\n    Content-Length: 14\n\n    {\"message\":\"\"}\n    ```\n\n    编写业务代码：\n\n      * api 文件定义了服务对外 HTTP 接口，可参考 [api 规范](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/docs/zero/goctl-api.md)\n      * 可以在 `servicecontext.go` 里面传递依赖给 logic，比如 mysql, redis 等\n      * 在 api 定义的 `get/post/put/delete` 等请求对应的 logic 里增加业务处理逻辑\n\n3. 可以根据 api 文件生成前端需要的 Java, TypeScript, Dart, JavaScript 代码\n\n    ```shell\n    goctl api java -api greet.api -dir greet\n    goctl api dart -api greet.api -dir greet\n    ...\n    ```\n\n## 7.

It’s born to ensure the stability of the busy services with resilience design and has been serving sites with tens of millions of users for years.\n\ngo-zero contains simple API description syntax and code generation tool called `goctl`. You can generate Go, iOS, Android, Kotlin, Dart, TypeScript, JavaScript from .api files with `goctl`.\n\n#### Advantages of go-zero:\n\n* Improves the stability of the services with tens of millions of daily active users\n* Builtin chained timeout control, concurrency control, rate limit, adaptive circuit breaker, adaptive load shedding, even no configuration needed\n* Builtin middlewares also can be integrated into your frameworks\n* Simple API syntax, one command to generate a couple of different languages\n* Auto validate the request parameters from clients\n* Plenty of builtin microservice management and concurrent toolkits\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/main/doc/images/architecture-en.png\" alt=\"Architecture\" width=\"1500\" />\n\n## Backgrounds of go-zero\n\nIn early 2018, we embarked on a transformative journey to redesign our system, transitioning from a monolithic architecture built with Java and MongoDB to a microservices architecture. After careful research and comparison, we made a deliberate choice to:\n\n* Go Beyond with Golang\n  * Great performance\n  * Simple syntax\n  * Proven engineering efficiency\n  * Extreme deployment experience\n  * Less server resource consumption\n\n* Self-Design Our Microservice Architecture\n  * Microservice architecture facilitates the creation of scalable, flexible, and maintainable software systems with independent, reusable components.\n  * Easy to locate the problems within microservices.\n  * Easy to extend the features by adding or modifying specific microservices without impacting the entire system.\n\n## Design considerations on go-zero\n\nBy designing the microservice architecture, we expected to ensure stability, as well as productivity. And from just the beginning, we have the following design principles:\n\n* Keep it simple\n* High availability\n* Stable on high concurrency\n* Easy to extend\n* Resilience design, failure-oriented programming\n* Try best to be friendly to the business logic development, encapsulate the complexity\n* One thing, one way\n\nAfter almost half a year, we finished the transfer from a monolithic system to microservice system and deployed on August 2018. The new system guaranteed business growth and system stability.\n\n## The implementation and features of go-zero\n\ngo-zero is a web and rpc framework that integrates lots of engineering practices. The features are mainly listed below:\n\n* Powerful tool included, less code to write\n* Simple interfaces\n* Fully compatible with net/http\n* Middlewares are supported, easy to extend\n* High performance\n* Failure-oriented programming, resilience design\n* Builtin service discovery, load balancing\n* Builtin concurrency control, adaptive circuit breaker, adaptive load shedding, auto-trigger, auto recover\n* Auto validation of API request parameters\n* Chained timeout control\n* Auto management of data caching\n* Call tracing, metrics, and monitoring\n* High concurrency protected\n\nAs below, go-zero protects the system with a couple of layers and mechanisms:\n\n![Resilience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/main/doc/images/resilience-en.png)\n\n##  The simplified architecture that we use with go-zero\n\n<img width=\"1067\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1918356/171880372-5010d846-e8b1-4942-8fe2-e2bbb584f762.png\">\n\n##  Installation\n\nRun the following command under your project:\n\n```shell\ngo get -u github.com/zeromicro/go-zero\n```\n\n##  Quick Start\n\n1. Full examples can be checked out from below:\n\n     [Rapid development of microservice systems](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/doc/shorturl-en.md)\n\n     [Rapid development of microservice systems - multiple RPCs](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/docs/zero/bookstore-en.md)\n\n2. Install goctl\n\n   `goctl`can be read as `go control`. `goctl` means not to be controlled by code, instead, we control it. The inside `go` is not `golang`. At the very beginning, I was expecting it to help us improve productivity, and make our lives easier.\n\n   ```shell\n   # for Go\n   go install github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/tools/goctl@latest\n   \n   # For Mac\n   brew install goctl\n   \n   # docker for all platforms\n   docker pull kevinwan/goctl\n   # run goctl\n   docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/app kevinwan/goctl --help\n   ```\n   \n   make sure goctl is executable and in your $PATH.\n   \n3. Create the API file, like greet.api, you can install the plugin of goctl in vs code, api syntax is supported.\n\n   ```go\n   type (\n     Request {\n       Name string `path:\"name,options=[you,me]\"` // parameters are auto validated\n     }\n\n     Response {\n       Message string `json:\"message\"`\n     }\n   )\n\n   service greet-api {\n     @handler GreetHandler\n     get /greet/from/:name(Request) returns (Response)\n   }\n   ```\n\n   the .api files also can be generated by goctl, like below:\n\n   ```shell\n   goctl api -o greet.api\n   ```\n\n4. Generate the go server-side code\n\n   ```shell\n   goctl api go -api greet.api -dir greet\n   ```\n\n   the generated files look like:\n\n   ```Plain Text\n   ├── greet\n   │   ├── etc\n   │   │   └── greet-api.yaml        // configuration file\n   │   ├── greet.go                  // main file\n   │   └── internal\n   │       ├── config\n   │       │   └── config.go         // configuration definition\n   │       ├── handler\n   │       │   ├── greethandler.go   // get/put/post/delete routes are defined here\n   │       │   └── routes.go         // routes list\n   │       ├── logic\n   │       │   └── greetlogic.go     // request logic can be written here\n   │       ├── svc\n   │       │   └── servicecontext.go // service context, mysql/redis can be passed in here\n   │       └── types\n   │           └── types.go          // request/response defined here\n   └── greet.api                     // api description file\n   ```\n\n   the generated code can be run directly:\n\n   ```shell\n   cd greet\n   go mod tidy\n   go run greet.go -f etc/greet-api.yaml\n   ```\n\n   by default, it’s listening on port 8888, while it can be changed in the configuration file.\n\n   you can check it by curl:\n\n   ```shell\n   curl -i http://localhost:8888/greet/from/you\n   ```\n\n   the response looks like below:\n\n   ```http\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n   Date: Sun, 30 Aug 2020 15:32:35 GMT\n   Content-Length: 0\n   ```\n\n5. Write the business logic code\n\n    * the dependencies can be passed into the logic within servicecontext.go, like mysql, redis, etc.\n    * add the logic code in a logic package according to .api file\n\n6. Generate code like Java, TypeScript, Dart, JavaScript, etc. just from the api file\n\n   ```shell\n   goctl api java -api greet.api -dir greet\n   goctl api dart -api greet.api -dir greet\n   ...\n   ```\n\n## Benchmark\n\n![benchmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/main/doc/images/benchmark.png)\n\n[Checkout the test code](https://github.com/smallnest/go-web-framework-benchmark)\n\n## Documents\n\n* [Documents](https://go-zero.dev/)\n* [Rapid development of microservice systems](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/doc/shorturl-en.md)\n* [Rapid development of microservice systems - multiple RPCs](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/docs/zero/bookstore-en.md)\n* [Examples](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-examples)\n\n##  Chat group\n\nJoin the chat via https://discord.gg/4JQvC5A4Fe\n\n##  Cloud Native Landscape\n\n<p float=\"left\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/main/doc/images/cncf-logo.svg\" width=\"200\"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/main/doc/images/cncf-landscape-logo.svg\" width=\"150\"/>\n</p>\n\ngo-zero enlisted in the [CNCF Cloud Native Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=go-zero).\n\n## Give a Star! ⭐\n\nIf you like this project or are using it to learn or start your own solution, give it a star to get updates on new releases.
