Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event.

This is the project for you!\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish\nto make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository\nbefore making a change.\n\n## So all code changes happen through Pull Requests\n\nPull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively\nwelcome your pull requests:\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n3. If you've added code that need documentation, update the documentation.\n4. Make sure your code follows the [effective go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines as much as possible.\n5. Be sure to test your modifications.\n6. Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).\n7. Issue that pull request!\n\n## Vendoring\n\nWe use a vendor directory to store all dependent files. A vendor directory ensures a single source of truth, so that it's clear in each PR what changes are being made, as well as allowing quick testing-out of ideas across various dependent package, or searching the files in your dependent packages via your editor.\n\nBUT this currently comes at a cost. I have begrudgingly migrated from dep to go modules, and go modules are still working on their support for vendor directories:\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/27227\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/30240\n\nThis means there is a little overhead in working with the code base. If you need to make changes to dependent packages, you have two approaches you can take:\n\n# 1)\n\na) Set `export GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor` in your ~/.bashrc file\nb) use `go run main.go` to run lazydocker\nc) if you need to bump a dependency e.g. jesseduffield/gocui, use\n\n```\nGOFLAGS= go get -u github.com/jesseduffield/gocui@master\ngo mod tidy\ngo mod vendor\n```\n\n# 2)\n\na) don't worry about your ~/.bashrc file\nb) use `go run -mod=vendor main.go` to run lazydocker\nc) if you need to bump a dependency e.g. jesseduffield/gocui, use\n\n```\ngo get -u github.com/jesseduffield/gocui@master\ngo mod tidy\ngo mod vendor\n```\n\nHopefully this will be much more streamlined in the future :)\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nPlease note by participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct].\n\n[code of conduct]: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md\n\n## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License\n\nIn short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be\nunder the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that\ncovers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.\n\n## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/issues)\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new\nissue](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/issues/new); it's that easy!\n"

Maybe a service is down. `docker-compose ps`. Yep, it's that microservice that's still buggy. No issue, I'll just restart it: `docker-compose restart`. Okay now let's try again. Oh wait the issue is still there. Hmm. `docker-compose ps`. Right so the service must have just stopped immediately after starting. I probably would have known that if I was reading the log stream, but there is a lot of clutter in there from other services. I could get the logs for just that one service with `docker compose logs --follow myservice` but that dies everytime the service dies so I'd need to run that command every time I restart the service. I could alternatively run `docker-compose up myservice` and in that terminal window if the service is down I could just `up` it again, but now I've got one service hogging a terminal window even after I no longer care about its logs. I guess when I want to reclaim the terminal realestate I can do `ctrl+P,Q`, but... wait, that's not working for some reason. Should I use ctrl+C instead? I can't remember if that closes the foreground process or kills the actual service.\n\nWhat a headache!\n\nMemorising docker commands is hard. Memorising aliases is slightly less hard. Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible. What if you had all the information you needed in one terminal window with every common command living one keypress away (and the ability to add custom commands as well). Lazydocker's goal is to make that dream a reality.\n\n- [Requirements](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#requirements)\n- [Installation](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#installation)\n- [Usage](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#usage)\n- [Keybindings](/docs/keybindings)\n- [Cool Features](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#cool-features)\n- [Contributing](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#contributing)\n- [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/NICqQPxwJWw)\n- [Config Docs](/docs/Config.md)\n- [Twitch Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/jesseduffield)\n- [FAQ](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#faq)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Docker >= **1.13** (API >= **1.25**)\n- Docker-Compose >= **1.23.2** (optional)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Homebrew\n\nNormally `lazydocker` formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you to tap our formula to get frequently updated one. It works with Linux, too.\n\n**Tap**:\n```sh\nbrew install jesseduffield/lazydocker/lazydocker\n```\n\n**Core**:\n```sh\nbrew install lazydocker\n```\n\n### Scoop (Windows)\n\nYou can install `lazydocker` using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):\n\n```sh\nscoop install lazydocker\n```\n### Chocolatey (Windows)\n\nYou can install `lazydocker` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):\n\n```sh\nchoco install lazydocker\n```\n### asdf-vm\n\nYou can install [asdf-lazydocker plugin](https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker) using [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/):\n#### Setup (Once)\n```sh\nasdf plugin add lazydocker https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker.git\n```\n\n#### For Install / Upgrade\n```sh\nasdf list all lazydocker\nasdf install lazydocker latest\nasdf global lazydocker latest\n```\n\n### Binary Release (Linux/OSX/Windows)\n\nYou can manually download a binary release from [the release page](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/releases).\n\nAutomated install/update, don't forget to always verify what you're piping into bash:\n\n```sh\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/master/scripts/install_update_linux.sh | bash\n```\nThe script installs downloaded binary to `$HOME/.local/bin` directory by default, but it can be changed by setting `DIR` environment variable.\n\n### Go\n\nRequired Go Version >= **1.19**\n\n```sh\ngo install github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker@latest\n```\n\nRequired Go version >= **1.8**, <= **1.17**\n\n```sh\ngo get github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker\n```\n\n### Arch Linux AUR\n\nYou can install lazydocker using the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazydocker) by running:\n\n```sh\nyay -S lazydocker\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/lazyteam/lazydocker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazyteam/lazydocker)\n[![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/lazyteam/lazydocker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazyteam/lazydocker)\n[![Docker Automated](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/automated/lazyteam/lazydocker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazyteam/lazydocker)\n\n1. <details><summary>Click if you have an ARM device</summary><p>\n\n    - If you have a ARM 32 bit v6 architecture\n\n        ```sh\n        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \\\n        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm32v6/golang \\\n        --build-arg GOARCH=arm \\\n        --build-arg GOARM=6 \\\n        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\n        ```\n\n    - If you have a ARM 32 bit v7 architecture\n\n        ```sh\n        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \\\n        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm32v7/golang \\\n        --build-arg GOARCH=arm \\\n        --build-arg GOARM=7 \\\n        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\n        ```\n\n    - If you have a ARM 64 bit v8 architecture\n\n        ```sh\n        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \\\n        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm64v8/golang \\\n        --build-arg GOARCH=arm64 \\\n        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\n        ```\n\n    </p></details>\n\n1. Run the container\n\n    ```sh\n    docker run --rm -it -v \\\n    /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n    -v /yourpath:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker \\\n    lazyteam/lazydocker\n    ```\n\n    - Don't forget to change `/yourpath` to an actual path you created to store lazydocker's config\n    - You can also use this [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)\n    - You might want to create an alias, for example:\n\n        ```sh\n        echo \"alias lzd='docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /yourpath/config:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker lazyteam/lazydocker'\" >> ~/.zshrc\n        ```\n\n\n\nFor development, you can build the image using:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\ncd lazydocker\ndocker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \\\n    --build-arg BUILD_DATE=`date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"` \\\n    --build-arg VCS_REF=`git rev-parse --short HEAD` \\\n    --build-arg VERSION=`git describe --abbrev=0 --tag` \\\n    .\n```\n\nIf you encounter a compatibility issue with Docker bundled binary, try rebuilding\nthe image with the build argument `--build-arg DOCKER_VERSION=\"v$(docker -v | cut -d\" \" -f3 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev)\"`\nso that the bundled docker binary matches your host docker binary version.\n\n### Manual\n\nYou'll need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\ncd lazydocker\ngo install\n```\n\nYou can also use `go run main.go` to compile and run in one go (pun definitely intended)\n\n## Usage\n\nCall `lazydocker` in your terminal. I personally use this a lot so I've made an alias for it like so:\n\n```\necho \"alias lzd='lazydocker'\" >> ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n(you can substitute .zshrc for whatever rc file you're using)\n\n- Basic video tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/NICqQPxwJWw).\n- List of keybindings\n  [here](/docs/keybindings).\n\n## Cool features\n\neverything is one keypress away (or one click away! Mouse support FTW):\n\n- viewing the state of your docker or docker-compose container environment at a glance\n- viewing logs for a container/service\n- viewing ascii graphs of your containers' metrics so that you can not only feel but also look like a developer\n- customising those graphs to measure nearly any metric you want\n- attaching to a container/service\n- restarting/removing/rebuilding containers/services\n- viewing the ancestor layers of a given image\n- pruning containers, images, or volumes that are hogging up disk space\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere is still a lot of work to go! Please check out the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\nFor contributor discussion about things not better discussed here in the repo, join the discord channel\n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/ehwFt2t4wt\"><img src='/docs/resources/discord.png' width='75'></a>\n\n## Donate\n\nIf you would like to support the development of lazydocker, consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/jesseduffield) (github is matching all donations dollar-for-dollar for 12 months)\n\n## Social\n\nIf you want to see what I (Jesse) am up to in terms of development, follow me on\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/DuffieldJesse) or watch me program on\n[twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jesseduffield)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I edit my config?\n\nBy opening lazydocker, clicking on the 'project' panel in the top left, and pressing 'o' (or 'e' if your editor is vim). See [Config Docs](/docs/Config.md)\n\n### How do I get text to wrap in my main panel?\n\nIn the future I want to make this the default, but for now there are some CPU issues that arise with wrapping. If you want to enable wrapping, use `gui.wrapMainPanel: true`\n\n### How do you select text?\n\nBecause we support mouse events, you will need to hold option while dragging the mouse to indicate you're trying to select text rather than click on something. Alternatively you can disable mouse events via the `gui.ignoreMouseEvents` config value.\n\nMac Users: See [Issue #190](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/issues/190) for other options.\n\n### Why can't I see my container's logs?\n\nBy default we only show logs from the last hour, so that we're not putting too much strain on the machine. This may be why you can't see logs when you first start lazydocker. This can be overwritten in the config's `commandTemplates`\n\nIf you are running lazydocker in Docker container, it is a know bug, that you can't see logs or CPU usage.\n\n## Alternatives\n\n- [docui](https://github.com/skanehira/docui) - Skanehira beat me to the punch on making a docker terminal UI, so definitely check out that repo as well! I think the two repos can live in harmony though: lazydocker is more about managing existing containers/services, and docui is more about creating and configuring them.\n- [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) - Portainer tries to solve the same problem but it's accessed via your browser rather than your terminal. It also supports docker swarm.\n- See [Awesome Docker list](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker/blob/master/README.md#terminal) for similar tools to work with Docker.\n"
