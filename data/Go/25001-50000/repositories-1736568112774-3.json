By creating a list of production use cases we hope to build a community of advisors that we can reach out to with experience using various etcd applications, operation environments, and cluster sizes. The etcd development team may reach out periodically to check-in on how etcd is working in the field and update this list.\n\n## All Kubernetes Users\n\n- *Application*: https://kubernetes.io/\n- *Environments*: AWS, OpenStack, Azure, Google Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Bare Metal, etc\n\n**This is a meta user; please feel free to document specific Kubernetes clusters!**\n\nAll Kubernetes clusters use etcd as their primary data store.

[These](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype%2Fflake) are the currently open flaky test issues.\n\nFor more, because etcd uses Kubernetes' prow infrastructure to run CI jobs, the past test results can be viewed at [testgrid](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-etcd).\n\n| Tests  | Status  |\n| -----  | ------  |\n| periodics e2e-amd64  | [![sig-etcd-periodics/ci-etcd-e2e-amd64](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-periodics/ci-etcd-e2e-amd64/tests_status?style=svg)](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-periodics/ci-etcd-e2e-amd64)  |\n| presubmit build      | [![sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-build](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-build/tests_status?style=svg)](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-build)  |\n| presubmit e2e-amd64  | [![sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-e2e-amd64](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-e2e-amd64/tests_status?style=svg)](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-e2e-amd64)  |\n| presubmit unit-test  | [![sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-unit-test](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-unit-test/tests_status?style=svg)](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-unit-test)  |\n| presubmit verify     | [![sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-verify](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-verify/tests_status?style=svg)](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-presubmits/pull-etcd-verify)  |\n| postsubmit build     | [![sig-etcd-postsubmits/post-etcd-build](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-postsubmits/post-etcd-build/tests_status?style=svg)](https://testgrid.k8s.io/q/summary/sig-etcd-postsubmits/post-etcd-build)  |\n\nIf you find any flaky tests on testgrid, please\n\n1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype%2Fflake) to see if an issue has already been opened for this test. If not, open an issue with the `type/flake` label.\n2. Try to reproduce the flaky test on your machine via [`stress`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stress), for example, to reproduce the failure of `TestPeriodicSkipRevNotChange`:\n\n```bash\n# install the stress utility\ngo install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stress@latest\ncd server/etcdserver/api/v3compactor\n# compile the test\ngo test -v -c -count 1\n# run the compiled test file using stress\nstress -p=8 ./v3compactor.test -test.run “^TestPeriodicSkipRevNotChange$”\n```\n3. Fix it.\n\n## Set up development environment\n\nThe etcd project supports two options for development:\n\n 1. Manually set up the local environment.\n 2. Automatically set up [devcontainer](https://containers.dev).\n\nFor both options, the only supported architecture is `linux-amd64`. Bug reports for other environments will generally be ignored. Supporting new environments requires the introduction of proper tests and maintainer support that is currently lacking in the etcd project.\n\nIf you would like etcd to support your preferred environment you can [file an issue].\n\n### Option 1 - Manually set up the local environment\n\nThis is the original etcd development environment, is most supported, and is backward compatible for the development of older etcd versions.\n\nFollow the steps below to set up the environment:\n\n- [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)\n- Install Go by following [installation](https://go.dev/doc/install). Please check the minimal go version in [go.mod file](./go.mod#L3).\n- Install build tools:\n  - [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): For Debian-based distributions\n    you can run `sudo apt-get install build-essential`\n  - [`protoc`](https://protobuf.dev/): You can download it for your os. Use\n    version\n    [`v3.20.3`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.20.3).\n  - [`yamllint`](https://www.yamllint.com/): For Debian-based distribution you\n    can run `sudo apt-get install yamllint`\n  - [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/): For Debian-based distribution you can\n    run `sudo apt-get install jq`\n  - [`xz`](https://tukaani.org/xz/): For Debian-based distribution you can run\n    `sudo apt-get install xz-utils`\n- Verify that everything is installed by running `make build`\n\nNote: `make build` runs with `-v`. Other build flags can be added through env `GO_BUILD_FLAGS`, **if required**. Eg.,\n```console\nGO_BUILD_FLAGS=\"-buildmode=pie\" make build\n```\n\n### Option 2 - Automatically set up devcontainer\n\nThis is a more recently added environment that aims to make it faster for new contributors to get started with etcd. This option is supported for etcd versions 3.6 onwards.\n\nThis option can be [used locally](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) on a system running Visual Studio Code and Docker, or in a remote cloud-based [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) environment.\n\nTo get started, create a codespace for this repository by clicking this 👇\n\n[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=11225014)\n\nA codespace will open in a web-based version of Visual Studio Code. The [dev container](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) is fully configured with the software needed for this project.\n\n**Note**: Dev containers is an open spec which is supported by [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) and [other tools](https://containers.dev/supporting).\n\n[file an issue]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/new/choose\n\n## Implement your change\n\netcd code should follow the coding style suggested by the Golang community.\nSee the [style doc](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments) for details.\n\nPlease ensure that your change passes static analysis (requires\n[golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/)):\n- `make verify` to verify if all checks pass.\n- `make verify-*` to verify a single check, for example, `make verify-bom` to verify if `bill-of-materials.json` file is up-to-date.\n- `make fix` to fix all checks.\n- `make fix-*` to fix a single check, for example, `make fix-bom` to update `bill-of-materials.json`.\n\nPlease ensure that your change passes tests.\n- `make test-unit` to run unit tests.\n- `make test-integration` to run integration tests.\n- `make test-e2e` to run e2e tests.\n\nAll changes are expected to come with a unit test.\nAll new features are expected to have either e2e or integration tests.\n\n## Commit your change\n\netcd follows a rough convention for commit messages:\n* First line:\n  * Should start with the name of the package (for example `etcdserver`, `etcdctl`) followed by the `:` character.\n  * Describe the `what` behind the change\n* Optionally, the author might provide the `why` behind the change in the main commit message body.\n* Last line should be `Signed-off-by: firstname lastname <email@example.com>` (can be automatically generate by providing `--signoff` to git commit command).\n\nExample of commit message:\n```\netcdserver: add grpc interceptor to log info on incoming requests\n\nTo improve debuggability of etcd v3. Added a grpc interceptor to log\ninfo on incoming requests to etcd server. The log output includes\nremote client info, request content (with value field redacted), request\nhandling latency, response size, etc. Uses zap logger if available,\notherwise uses capnslog.\n\nSigned-off-by: FirstName LastName <github@github.com>\n```\n\n## Create a pull request\n\nPlease follow the [making a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request) guide.\n\nIf you are still working on the pull request, you can convert it to a draft by clicking `Convert to draft` link just below the list of reviewers.\n\nMultiple small PRs are preferred over single large ones (>500 lines of code).\n\nPlease make sure there is an associated issue for each PR you submit. Create one if it doesn't exist yet, and close the issue\nonce the PR gets merged and has been backported to previous stable releases, if necessary. If there are multiple PRs linked to\nthe same issue, refrain from closing the issue until all PRs have been merged and, if needed, backported to previous stable\nreleases.\n\n## Get your pull request reviewed\n\nBefore requesting review please ensure that all GitHub and Prow checks are successful. In some cases your pull request may have the label `needs-ok-to-test`. If so an `etcd-io` organisation member will leave a comment on your pull request with `/ok-to-test` to trigger all checks to be run.\n\nIt might happen that some unrelated tests on your PR are failing, due to their flakiness.\nIn such cases please [file an issue] to deflake the problematic test and ask one of [maintainers] to rerun the tests.\n\nIf all checks were successful feel free to reach out for review from people that were involved in the original discussion or [maintainers].\nDepending on the complexity of the PR it might require between 1 and 2 maintainers to approve your change before merging.\n\nThanks for contributing!\n"

For specific guidance on practical contribution steps\nplease see [contributor guide] guide.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\nEtcd project roles along with their requirements and responsibilities are defined\nin [community membership].\n\n## Decision making process\n\nDecisions are built on consensus between [maintainers] publicly. Proposals and ideas\ncan either be submitted for agreement via a GitHub issue or PR, or by sending an email\nto `etcd-maintainers@googlegroups.com`.\n\n## Conflict resolution\n\nIn general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably\nworked out between the persons involved. However, any technical dispute that has\nreached an impasse with a subset of the community, any contributor may open a GitHub\nissue or PR or send an email to `etcd-maintainers@googlegroups.com`. If the\nmaintainers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will be resolved by a\nsupermajority of the maintainers with a fallback on lazy consensus after three business\nweeks inactive voting period and as long as two maintainers are on board.\n\n## Changes in Governance\n\nChanges in project governance could be initiated by opening a GitHub PR.\n\n[community membership]: /Documentation/contributor-guide/community-membership.md\n[Code of Conduct]: /code-of-conduct.md\n[contributor guide]: /CONTRIBUTING.md\n[maintainers]: /OWNERS\n"

Reliability is further ensured by rigorous [**robustness testing**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/tests/robustness).\n\nSee [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.\n\n![etcd reliability is important](logos/etcd-xkcd-2347.png)\n\n<sub>Original image credited to  xkcd.com/2347, alterations by Josh Berkus.</sub>\n\n[raft]: https://raft.github.io/\n[k8s]: http://kubernetes.io/\n[doorman]: https://github.com/youtube/doorman\n[locksmith]: https://github.com/coreos/locksmith\n[vulcand]: https://github.com/vulcand/vulcand\n[etcdctl]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/etcdctl\n\n## Maintainers\n\n[Maintainers](OWNERS) strive to shape an inclusive open source project culture where users are heard and contributors feel respected and empowered. Maintainers aim to build productive relationships across different companies and disciplines. Read more about [Maintainers role and responsibilities](Documentation/contributor-guide/community-membership.md#maintainers).\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Getting etcd\n\nThe easiest way to get etcd is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, and Docker on the [release page][github-release].\n\nFor more installation guides, please check out [play.etcd.io](http://play.etcd.io) and [operating etcd](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide).\n\n[github-release]: https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases\n\n### Running etcd\n\nFirst start a single-member cluster of etcd.\n\nIf etcd is installed using the [pre-built release binaries][github-release], run it from the installation location as below:\n\n```bash\n/tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd\n```\n\nThe etcd command can be simply run as such if it is moved to the system path as below:\n\n```bash\nmv /tmp/etcd-download-test/etcd /usr/local/bin/\netcd\n```\n\nThis will bring up etcd listening on port 2379 for client communication and on port 2380 for server-to-server communication.\n\nNext, let's set a single key, and then retrieve it:\n\n```bash\netcdctl put mykey \"this is awesome\"\netcdctl get mykey\n```\n\netcd is now running and serving client requests. For more, please check out:\n\n* [Interactive etcd playground](http://play.etcd.io)\n* [Animated quick demo](https://etcd.io/docs/latest/demo)\n\n### etcd TCP ports\n\nThe [official etcd ports][iana-ports] are 2379 for client requests, and 2380 for peer communication.\n\n[iana-ports]: http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.txt\n\n### Running a local etcd cluster\n\nFirst install [goreman](https://github.com/mattn/goreman), which manages Procfile-based applications.\n\nOur [Procfile script](./Procfile) will set up a local example cluster. Start it with:\n\n```bash\ngoreman start\n```\n\nThis will bring up 3 etcd members `infra1`, `infra2` and `infra3` and optionally etcd `grpc-proxy`, which runs locally and composes a cluster.\n\nEvery cluster member and proxy accepts key value reads and key value writes.\n\nFollow the comments in [Procfile script](./Procfile) to add a learner node to the cluster.\n\n### Install etcd client v3\n\n```bash\ngo get go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3\n```\n\n### Next steps\n\nNow it's time to dig into the full etcd API and other guides.\n\n* Read the full [documentation].\n* Review etcd [frequently asked questions].\n* Explore the full gRPC [API].\n* Set up a [multi-machine cluster][clustering].\n* Learn the [config format, env variables and flags][configuration].\n* Find [language bindings and tools][integrations].\n* Use TLS to [secure an etcd cluster][security].\n* [Tune etcd][tuning].\n\n[documentation]: https://etcd.io/docs/latest\n[api]: https://etcd.io/docs/latest/learning/api\n[clustering]: https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide/clustering\n[configuration]: https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide/configuration\n[integrations]: https://etcd.io/docs/latest/integrations\n[security]: https://etcd.io/docs/latest/op-guide/security\n[tuning]: https://etcd.io/docs/latest/tuning\n\n## Contact\n\n* Email: [etcd-dev](https://groups.google.com/g/etcd-dev)\n* Slack: [#sig-etcd](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C3HD8ARJ5) channel on Kubernetes ([get an invite](http://slack.kubernetes.io/))\n* [Community meetings](#community-meetings)\n\n### Community meetings\n\netcd contributors and maintainers meet every week at `11:00` AM (USA Pacific) on Thursday and meetings alternate between community meetings and issue triage meetings. Meeting agendas are recorded in a [shared Google doc][shared-meeting-notes] and everyone is welcome to suggest additional topics or other agendas.\n\nIssue triage meetings are aimed at getting through our backlog of PRs and Issues. Triage meetings are open to any contributor; you don't have to be a reviewer or approver to help out! They can also be a good way to get started contributing.\n\nThe meeting lead role is rotated for each meeting between etcd maintainers or sig-etcd leads and is recorded in a [shared Google sheet][shared-rotation-sheet].\n\nMeeting recordings are uploaded to the official etcd [YouTube channel].\n\nGet calendar invitations by joining [etcd-dev](https://groups.google.com/g/etcd-dev) mailing group.\n\nJoin the CNCF-funded Zoom channel: [zoom.us/my/cncfetcdproject](https://zoom.us/my/cncfetcdproject)\n\n[shared-meeting-notes]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16XEGyPBisZvmmoIHSZzv__LoyOeluC5a4x353CX0SIM/edit\n[shared-rotation-sheet]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jodHIO7Dk2VWTs1IRnfMFaRktS9IH8XRyifOnPdSY8I/edit\n[YouTube channel]: https://www.youtube.com/@etcdio\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on setting up your development environment, submitting patches and the contribution workflow.\n\nPlease refer to [community-membership.md](Documentation/contributor-guide/community-membership.md#member) for information on becoming an etcd project member.  We welcome and look forward to your contributions to the project!\n\nPlease also refer to [roadmap](Documentation/contributor-guide/roadmap.md) to get more details on the priorities for the next few major or minor releases.\n\n## Reporting bugs\n\nSee [reporting bugs](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/Documentation/contributor-guide/reporting_bugs.md) for details about reporting any issues.
