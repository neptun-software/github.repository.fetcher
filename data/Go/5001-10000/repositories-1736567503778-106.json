Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.\n \n Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement\n (CLA).\n \n   * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you\n     own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an\n     [individual CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/node/285/node/285/individual-signup).\n   * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,\n     then you'll need to sign a\n     [corporate CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/?destination=node/285/organization-signup).\n\n### Contributing A Patch\n * Sign a Contributor License Agreement, if you haven't already done so(see details above).\n * Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.\n * Submit a pull request.\n\nAll changes must be code reviewed. Coding conventions and standards are explained in the official \n[developer docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel). Expect \nreviewers to request that you avoid common [go style mistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)\nin your PRs.\n\n### Merge Approval\n\nAutoscaler collaborators may add \"LGTM\" (Looks Good To Me) or an equivalent comment to indicate \nthat a PR is acceptable. Any change requires at least one LGTM. No pull requests can be merged \nuntil at least one Autoscaler collaborator signs off with an LGTM.\n\n### Support Channels\n\nWhether you are a user or contributor, official support channels include:\n\n * GitHub issues: https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues\n * Slack: Sig-autoscaling room in the [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fsig-autoscaling)\n * Email: kubernetes-users [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-autoscaling)\n\nFor further information, please refer to [Kubernetes Contributor Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/README.md)\n"

Supports several public cloud providers. Version 1.0 (GA) was released with kubernetes 1.8.\n\n[Vertical Pod Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler) - a set of components that automatically adjust the\namount of CPU and memory requested by pods running in the Kubernetes Cluster. Current state - beta.\n\n[Addon Resizer](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/addon-resizer) - a simplified version of vertical pod autoscaler that modifies\nresource requests of a deployment based on the number of nodes in the Kubernetes Cluster. Current state - beta.\n\n[Charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/charts) - Supported Helm charts for components above.\n\n## Contact Info\n\nInterested in autoscaling? Want to talk? Have questions, concerns or great ideas?\n\nPlease join us on #sig-autoscaling at https://kubernetes.slack.com/, or join one\nof our weekly meetings.
