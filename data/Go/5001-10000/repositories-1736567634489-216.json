          "content": "# Changelog\n\n### 2.13.3 (May 25, 2023)\n\n- Feature: Add `.Values.hooks.curl.imagePullSecrets` and `.Values.hooks.curl.imagePullSecrets` to Helm values.\n  PR [3079](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3079).\n\n- Change: The default setting of the reinvocationPolicy for the mutating webhook dealing with agent injections\n  changed from `Never` to `IfNeeded`.\n\n- Bugfix: The `eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount` volume injected by EKS is now exported and remotely mounted\n  during an intercept.\n  Ticket [3166](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3166).\n\n- Bugfix: The mutating webhook now correctly applies the namespace selector even if the cluster version contains\n  non-numeric characters. For example, it can now handle versions such as Major:\"1\", Minor:\"22+\".\n  PR [3184](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3184).\n\n- Bugfix: The \"telepresence\" Docker network will now propagate DNS AAAA queries to the Telepresence DNS resolver when\n  it runs in a Docker container.\n  Ticket [3179](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3179).\n\n- Bugfix: Running `telepresence intercept --local-only --docker-run` no longer  results in a panic.\n  Ticket [3171](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3171).\n\n- Bugfix: Running `telepresence intercept --local-only --mount false` no longer results in an incorrect error message\n  saying \"a local-only intercept cannot have mounts\".\n  Ticket [3171](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3171).\n\n- Bugfix: The helm chart now correctly handles custom `agentInjector.webhook.port` that was not being set in hook URLs.\n  PR [3161](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3161).\n\n- Bugfix: `.intercept.disableGlobal` and `.timeouts.agentArrival` are now correctly honored.\n\n### 2.13.2 (May 12, 2023)\n- Bugfix: Replaced `/` characters with a `-` when the authenticator service creates the kubeconfig in the Telepresence cache.\n  PR [3167](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3167).\n\n- Feature: Configurable strategy (`auto`, `powershell`. or `registry`) to set the global DNS search path on Windows. Default\n  is `auto` which means try `powershell` first, and if it fails, fall back to `registry`.\n  Ticket [3152](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3152).\n\n- Feature: The timeout for the traffic manager to wait for traffic agent to arrive can\n  now be configured in the `values.yaml` file using `timeouts.agentArrival`. The default\n  timeout is still 30 seconds.\n  PR [3148](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3148).\n\n- Bugfix: The automatic discovery of a local container based cluster (minikube or kind) used when the\n  Telepresence daemon runs in a container, now works on macOS and Windows, and with different profiles,\n  ports, and cluster names\n  PR [3165](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3165).\n\n- Bugfix: FTP Stability improvements. Multiple simultaneous intercepts can transfer large files in bidirectionally and in parallel.\n  PR [3157](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3157).\n\n- Bugfix: Pods using persistent volumes no longer causes timeouts when intercepted.\n\n- Bugfix: Ensure that `telepresence connect` succeeds even though DNS isn't configured correctly.\n  Ticket [3143](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3143).\n  PR [3154](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3154).\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-manager would sometimes panic with a \"close of closed channel\" message and exit.\n  PR [3160](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3160).\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-manager would sometimes panic and exit after some time due to a type cast panic.\n  Ticket [3149](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3149).\n\n### 2.13.1 (April 20, 2023)\n\n- Change: Update ambassador-agent to version 1.13.13\n\n### 2.13.0 (April 18, 2023)\n\n- Feature: The Docker network used by a Kind or Minikube (using the \"docker\" driver) installation, is automatically\n  detected and connected to a Docker container running the Telepresence daemon.\n\n- Feature: Mapped namespaces are included in the output of the `telepresence status` command.\n\n- Feature: There's a new --address flag to the intercept command allowing users to set the target IP of the intercept.\n\n- Feature: The new flags `--docker-build`, and `--docker-build-opt` was added to `telepresence intercept` to facilitate a\n  docker run directly from a docker context.\n\n- Bugfix: Using `telepresence intercept --docker-run` now works with a container based daemon started with `telepresence connect --docker`\n\n- Bugfix: DNS works properly even when no cluster subnet is routed by the Telepresence VIF.\n\n- Bugfix: The Traffic Manager uses a fail-proof way to determine the cluster domain.\n\n- Bugfix: DNS on windows is more reliable and performant.\n\n- Bugfix: The agent is now correctly injected even with a high number of deployment starting at the same time.\n\n- Bugfix: The kubeconfig is made self-contained before running Telepresence daemon in a Docker container.\n\n- Bugfix: The client will no longer need cluster wide permissions when connected to a namespace scoped Traffic Manager.\n\n- BugFix: The version command won't throw an error anymore if there is no kubeconfig file defined.\n\n### 2.12.2 (April 4, 2023)\n\n- Security: Update golang to 1.20.3 to address CVE-2023-24534, CVE-2023-24536, CVE-2023-24537, CVE-2023-24538\n\n### 2.12.1 (March 22, 2023)\n\n- Bugfix: Illegal characters are now replaced when a docker container name is generated from a kubernetes context name.\n\n### 2.12.0 (March 20, 2023)\n\n- Feature: Telepresence can now start or connect to a daemon in a docker container by use of the global `--docker` flag.\n\n- Feature: Adds an authenticator package to support integration with the [client-go credential](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins) plugins when the\n  daemon runs in a docker container.\n\n- Feature: The `telepresence helm` command now accepts a `--namespace` flag.\n\n- Change: Telepresence will now detect if services and pods are routable, independently of one another, before adding their routes. This is a change from before, when being already able to connect to pods prevented the addition of routes for services too.\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-manager will no longer panic when the CNAME of kubernetes.default doesn't contain .svc.\n\n- Bugfix: The `telepresence helm install/upgrade --set` family of flags now work correctly with comma separated values.\n\n### 2.11.1 (February 27, 2023)\n\n- Bugfix: The multi-arch build now for the proprietary traffic-manager and traffic-agent now works for both amd64 and arm64.\n\n### 2.11.0 (February 22, 2023)\n\n- Feature: When Telepresence detects that it runs in a docker container, it will now expose its DNS on `localhost:53`. This makes the\n  container itself a DNS server. Very handy when other containers use `--network container:[tp-container]`.\n\n- Feature: A new flag, `--local-mount-port <port>` will make `telepresence intercept --detailed-output --output=[yaml|json]` create\n  a bridge to the remote SFTP service instead of starting an sshfs client. This enables the sshfs client to be started outside of the\n  container, and thus, mount filesystems that then can be used as source for volumes that other containers will use.\n\n- Feature: The Telepresence daemon can now run as a long-lived process in a docker container so that CLI commands that\n  run in other containers can use a common daemon for network access and intercepts.\n\n- Feature: A new boolean flag `--detailed-output` was added to the `telepresence intercept` command. It will output very\n  detailed information about an intercept when used together with `--output=[json|yaml]`.\n  Pull Request [3013](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3013).\n\n- Feature: IPv6 support. Thanks to [@0x6a77](https://www.github.com/0x6a77).\n  Ticket [2978](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/2978).\n\n- Feature: Adds two parameters `--also-proxy` and `--never-proxy` to the `telepresence connect` command.\n  Ticket [2950](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/2950).\n\n- Feature: Add a parameter `--manager-namespace` to the `telepresence connect` command.\n  Ticket [2968](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/2968)\n\n- Feature: Add a configuration `cluster.defaultManagerNamespace` for setting the default manager namespace.\n  Ticket [2968](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/2968)\n\n- Change: The namespace of the connected manager is now displayed in the `telepresence status` output.\n  Ticket [2968](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/2968)\n\n- Change: Depreciate `--watch` flag in `telepresence list` command. This is now covered by `--output json-stream`\n\n- Change: Add `--output` option `json-stream`\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a bug when detecting VPN conflicts on macOS that removed conflicting gateway links.\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a bug where connecting to certain VPNs that map the CIDR range of the cluster would result in no routes getting added.\n  Ticket [3006](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3006)\n\n- Bugfix: Support ARM64 architecture\n  Ticket [2786](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/2786)\n\n### 2.10.6 (February 14, 2023)\n\nSecurity release to rebuild with go 1.19.6\n\n### 2.10.5 (February 6, 2023)\n\n- Change: mTLS Secrets will now be mounted into the traffic agent, instead of expected to be read by it from the API.\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a bug that prevented the local daemons from automatically reconnecting to the traffic manager when the network connection was lost.\n\n### 2.10.4 (January 20, 2023)\n\n- Bugfix: Fix backward compatibility issue when using traffic-managers of version 2.9.5 or older.\n\n### 2.10.2 (January 16, 2023)\n\n- Bugfix: Ensure that CLI and user-daemon binaries are the same version when running `telepresence helm install`\n  or `telepresence helm upgrade`.\n\n### 2.10.1 (January 11, 2023)\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a regex in our release process.\n\n### 2.10.0 (January 11, 2023)\n\n- Feature: The Traffic Manager can now be set to either \"team\" mode or \"single user\" mode.\n  When in team mode, intercepts will default to http intercepts.\n\n- Feature: The `telepresence helm` sub-commands `insert` and `upgrade` now accepts all types\n  of helm `--set-XXX` flags.\n\n- Feature: A new `telepresence helm upgrade` command was added with the additional flags\n  `--reuse-values` and `--reset-values`. This means that the `telpresence helm install --upgrade`\n  flag has been deprecated.\n\n- Feature: Image pull secrets for the traffic-agent can now be added using the Helm chart setting\n  `agent.image.pullSecrets`.\n\n- Change: The configmap `traffic-manager-clients` has been renamed to `traffic-manager`.\n\n- Change: The Helm installation will now fail if `intercept.disableGlobal=true` and `traffiManager.mode`\n  is not set to `team`.\n\n- Change: If the cluster is Kubernetes 1.21 or later, the mutating webhook will find the correct namespace\n  using the label `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` rather than `app.kuberenetes.io/name`. Ticket [2913](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/2913).\n\n- Change: The name of the mutating webhook now contains the namespace of the traffic-manager so\n  that the webhook is easier to identify when there are multiple namespace scoped telepresence\n  installations in the cluster.\n\n- Change: The OSS Helm chart is no longer pushed to the datawire Helm repository. It will\n  instead be pushed from the telepresence proprietary repository. The OSS Helm chart is still\n  what's embedded in the OSS telepresence client. PR [2943](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/2943).\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence no longer panics when `--docker-run` is combined with `--name <name>` instead of\n  `--name=<name>`. Ticket [2953](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/2953).\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence traffic-manager extracts the cluster domain (e.g. \"cluster.local\") using a CNAME lookup for \"kubernetes.default\"\n  instead of \"kubernetes.default.svc\".\n\n- Bugfix: A timeout was added to the pre-delete hook `uninstall-agents`, so that a helm uninstall doesn't\n  hang when there is no running traffic-manager. PR [2937](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/2937).\n\n### 2.9.5 (December 8, 2022)\n\n- Security: Update golang to 1.19.4 to address\n  [CVE-2022-41720 and CVE-2022-41717](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/L_3rmdT0BMU).\n\n- Bugfix: A regression that was introduced in 2.9.3, preventing use of gce authentication without also\n  having a config element present in the gce configuration in the kubeconfig, has been fixed.\n\n### 2.9.4 (December 5, 2022)\n\n- Feature: The traffic-manager can automatically detect that the node subnets are different from the\n  pod subnets, and switch detection strategy to instead use subnets that cover the pod IPs.\n\n- Bugfix: The `telepresence helm` command `--set x=y` flag didn't correctly set values of other types\n  than `string`. The code now uses standard Helm semantics for this flag.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence now uses the correct `agent.image` properties in the Helm chart when copying\n  agent image settings from the `config.yml` file.\n\n- Bugfix: Initialization of FTP type file sharing is delayed, so that setting it using the Helm chart\n  value `intercept.useFtp=true` works as expected.\n\n- Bugfix: The port-forward that is created when Telepresence connects to a cluster is now properly\n  closed when `telepresence quit` is called.\n\n- Bugfix: The user daemon no longer panics when the `config.yml` is modified at a time when the user daemon\n  is running but no session is active.\n\n- Bugfix: Fix race condition that would occur when `telepresence connect` `telepresence leave` was called\n  several times in rapid succession.\n\n### 2.9.3 (November 23, 2022)\n\n- Feature: The helm chart now supports `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` for the traffic-manager\n  deployment, so that the pod automatically restarts if it doesn't respond.\n\n- Change: The root daemon now communicates directly with the traffic-manager instead of routing all\n  outbound traffic through the user daemon.\n\n- Change: The output of `telepresence version` is now aligned and no longer contains \"(api v3)\"\n\n- Bugfix: Using `telepresence loglevel LEVEL` now also sets the log level in the root daemon.\n\n- Bugfix: Multi valued kubernetes flags such as `--as-group` are now propagated correctly.\n\n- Bugfix: The root daemon would sometimes hang indefinitely when quit and connect were called\n  in rapid succession.\n\n- Bugfix: Don't use `systemd.resolved` base DNS resolver unless cluster is proxied.\n\n### 2.9.2 (November 16, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: Fix panic when connecting to an older traffic-manager.\n\n- Bugfix: Fix `http-header` flag sometimes wouldn't propagate correctly.\n\n### 2.9.1 (November 15, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: Fix regression in 2.9.0 causing `no Auth Provider found for name “gcp”` when connecting.\n\n### 2.9.0 (November 15, 2022)\n\n- Feature: A new `telepresence config view` command was added that shows how the client is currently configured.\n\n- Feature: The traffic-manager can now configure all clients that connect through the `client:` map in\n  the `values.yaml` file.\n\n- Feature: The traffic-manager version is now included in the output from the `telepresence version` command.\n- Feature: add `podLabels` values to Helm Chart to add extra labels to deployment.\n\n- Feature: The telepresence flag `--output` now accepts `yaml` as a valid format.\n\n- Change: The `telepresence status --json` flag is deprecated. Use `telepresence status --output=json` instead.\n\n- Bugfix: Informational messages that don't really originate from the command, such as \"Launching Telepresence Root Daemon\",\n  or \"An update of telepresence ...\", are discarded instead of being printed as plain text before the actual formatted\n  output when using the `--output=json`.\n\n- Bugfix: An attempt to use an invalid value for the global `--output` flag now renders a proper error message.\n\n- Bugfix: Unqualified service names now resolves OK when using `telepresence intercept --docker-run`.\n\n- Bugfix: Files lingering under /etc/resolver on macOS are now removed when a new root daemon starts.\n\n### 2.8.5 (November 2, 2022)\n\n- Change: This is a security release. It's identical with 2.8.3 but built using Go 1.19.3 to address\n  [CVE-2022-41716 and Go issue https://go.dev/issue/56284](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56284).\n\n### 2.8.4 (November 2, 2022)\n\n- Change: Failed security release. Use 2.8.5.\n\n### 2.8.3 (October 27, 2022)\n\n- Feature: The traffic-manager can be configured to disable global (non-http) intercepts using the\n  Helm chart setting `intercept.disableGlobal`.\n\n- Feature: The port used for the mutating webhook can be configured using the Helm chart setting\n  `agentInjector.webhook.port`.\n\n- Feature: A new repeated `--set a.b.c=v` flag was added to the `telepresence helm install` command so that\n  values can be passed directly from the command line, without first storing them in a file.\n\n- Change: The default port for the mutating webhook is now `443`. It used to be `8443`.\n\n- Change: The traffic-manager will no longer default to use the `tel2` image for the traffic-agent when it is\n  unable to connect to Ambassador Cloud. Air-gapped environments must declare what image to use in the Helm chart.\n\n- Bugfix: `telepresence connect` now works as long as the traffic manager is installed, even if\n  it wasn't installed via `helm install`\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence check-vpn no longer crashes when the daemons don't start properly.\n\n- Bugfix: The root daemon no longer crashes when the session boot times out before the cluster connection succeeds.\n\n### 2.8.2 (October 15, 2022)\n\n- Feature: The Telepresence DNS resolver is now capable of resolving queries of type `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`,\n  `MX`, `NS`, `PTR`, `SRV`, and `TXT`.\n\n- Feature: A new `client` struct was added to the Helm chart. It contains a `connectionTTL` that controls\n  how long the traffic manager will retain a client connection without seeing any sign of life from the client.\n\n- Feature: A `dns` struct container the fields `includeSuffixes` and `excludeSuffixes` was added to the Helm\n  chart `client` struct, making those values configurable per cluster.\n\n- Feature: The API port used by the traffic-manager is now configurable using the Helm chart value `apiPort`.\n  The default port is 8081.\n\n- Change: The Helm chart `dnsConfig` was deprecated but retained for backward compatibility. The fields\n  `alsoProxySubnets` and `neverProxySubnets` can now be found under `routing` in the `client` struct.\n\n- Change: The Helm chart `agentInjector.agentImage` was moved to `agent.image`. The old value is deprecated but\n  retained for backward compatibility.\n\n- Change: The Helm chart `agentInjector.appProtocolStrategy` was moved to `agent.appProtocolStrategy`. The old\n  value is deprecated but retained for backward compatibility.\n\n- Change: The Helm chart `dnsServiceName`, `dnsServiceNamespace`, and `dnsServiceIP` has been removed, because\n  they are no longer needed. The TUN-device will use the traffic-manager pod-IP on platforms where it needs to\n  dedicate an IP for its local resolver.\n\n- Bugfix: Environment variable interpolation now works for all definitions that are copied from pod containers\n  into the injected traffic-agent container.\n\n- Bugfix: An attempt to create simultaneous intercepts that span multiple namespace on the same workstation\n  is detected early and prohibited instead of resulting in failing DNS lookups later on.\n\n- Bugfix: Spurious and incorrect \"\"!! SRV xxx\"\" messages will no longer appear in the logs when the reason\n  is normal context cancellation.\n\n- Bugfix: Single label names now resolves correctly when using Telepresence in Docker on a Linux host\n\n- Bugfix: The Helm chart value `appProtocolStrategy` is now correctly named (used to be `appPortStategy`)\n- Bugfix: Include file name in error message when failing to parse JSON file.\n\n### 2.7.6 (September 16, 2022)\n\n- Reintroduce everything from 2.7.4 with fix for issue preventing the CLI from launching on arm64 builds\n\n### 2.7.5 (September 14, 2022)\n\n- Revert of release 2.7.5 (so essentially the same as 2.7.3)\n\n### 2.7.4 (September 14, 2022)\n\n- Feature: The `resources` for the traffic-agent container and the optional init container can\n  be specified in the Helm chart using the `resource` and `initResource` fields of the\n  `agentInjector.agentImage`.\n\n- Feature: When the traffic-manager fails to inject a traffic-agent, the cause for the failure is\n  detected by reading the cluster events, and propagated to the user.\n\n- Feature: Telepresence can now use an embedded FTP client and load an existing FUSE library\n  instead of running an external `sshfs` or `sshfs-win` binary. This feature is experimental\n  in 2.7.x and enabled by setting `intercept.useFtp` to `true` in the `config.yml`.\n\n- Change: Telepresence on Windows upgraded winfsp from version 1.10 to 1.11\n\n- Bugfix: Running CLI commands on Apple M1 machines will no longer throw warnings about `/proc/cpuinfo`\n  and `/proc/self/auxv`.\n\n### 2.7.3 (September 7, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: CLI commands that are executed by the user daemon now use a pseudo TTY. This enables\n  `docker run -it` to allocate a TTY and will also give other commands like `bash read` the\n  same behavior as when executed directly in a terminal.\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-manager will no longer log numerous warnings saying: \"Issuing a\n  systema request without ApiKey or InstallID may result in an error\".\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-manager will no longer log an error saying: \"Unable to derive subnets\n  from nodes\" when the `podCIDRStrategy` is `auto` and it chooses to instead derive the\n  subnets from the pod IPs.\n\n### 2.7.2 (August 25, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: Standard I/O is restored when using `telepresence intercept <opts> -- <command>`.\n\n- Bugfix: Graciously handle nil intercept environment from the traffic-manager.\n\n- Feature: The timeout for the initial connectivity check that Telepresence performs\n  in order to determine if the cluster's subnets are proxied or not can now be configured\n  in the `config.yml` file using `timeouts.connectivityCheck`. The default timeout was\n  changed from 5 seconds to 500 milliseconds to speed up the actual connect.\n\n- Feature: Adds cli autocompletion for the `--namespace` flag on the `list` and `intercept` commands,\n  autocompletion for interceptable workloads on the `intercept` command, and autocompletion for\n  active intercepts on the `leave` command.\n\n- Change: The command `telepresence gather-traces` now prints out a message on success.\n- Change: The command `telepresence upload-traces` now prints out a message on success.\n- Change: The command `telepresence gather-traces` now traces itself and reports errors with trace gathering\n\n- Change: The `cli.log` log is now logged at the same level as the `connector.log`\n\n- Bugfix: Streams created between the traffic-agent and the workstation are now properly closed\n  when no interceptor process has been started on the workstation. This fixes a potential problem where\n  a large number of attempts to connect to a non-existing interceptor would cause stream congestion\n  and an unresponsive intercept.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence help message functionality without a running user daemon has been restored.\n\n- Bugfix: The `telepresence list` command no longer includes the `traffic-manager` deployment.\n\n### 2.7.1 (August 10, 2022)\n\n- Change: The command `telepresence uninstall` has been restored, but the `--everything` flag is now deprecated.\n\n- Change: `telepresence helm uninstall` will only uninstall the traffic-manager and no longer accepts the `--everything`, `--agent`,\n  or `--all-agents` flags.\n\n- Bugfix: `telepresence intercept` will attempt to connect to the traffic manager before creating an intercept.\n\n### 2.7.0 (August 8, 2022)\n\n- Feature: `telepresence intercept` has gained a\n  `--preview-url-add-request-headers` flag (and `telepresence preview create` a `--add-request-headers` flag) that can be used to inject\n  request headers in to every request made through the preview URL.\n\n- Feature: The Docker image now contains a new program in addition to\n  the existing traffic-manager and traffic-agent: the pod-daemon. The\n  pod-daemon is a trimmed-down version of the user-daemon that is\n  designed to run as a sidecar in a Pod, enabling CI systems to create\n  preview deploys.\n\n- Feature: The Telepresence components now collect OpenTelemetry traces.\n  Up to 10MB of trace data are available at any given time for collection from\n  components. `telepresence gather-traces` is a new command that will collect\n  all that data and place it into a gzip file, and `telepresence upload-traces` is\n  a new command that will push the gzipped data into an OTLP collector.\n\n- Feature: The agent injector now supports a new annotation, `telepresence.getambassador.io/inject-ignore-volume-mounts`, that can be used to make the injector ignore specified volume mounts denoted by a comma-separated string.\n\n- Change: The traffic manager is no longer automatically installed into the cluster. Connecting or creating an intercept in a cluster without a traffic manager will return an error.\n\n- Feature: A new telepresence helm command was added to provide an easy way to install, upgrade, or uninstall the telepresence traffic-manager.\n\n- Change: The command `telepresence uninstall` has been moved to `telepresence helm uninstall`.\n\n- Change: Add an emptyDir volume and volume mount under `/tmp` on the agent sidecar so it works with `readOnlyRootFileSystem: true`\n\n- Feature: Added prometheus support to the traffic manager.\n\n### 2.6.8 (June 23, 2022)\n\n- Feature: The name and namespace for the DNS Service that the traffic-manager uses in DNS auto-detection can now be specified.\n\n- Feature: Should the DNS auto-detection logic in the traffic-manager fail, users can now specify a fallback IP to use.\n\n- Feature: It is now possible to intercept UDP ports with Telepresence and also use `--to-pod` to forward UDP\n  traffic from ports on localhost.\n\n- Change: The Helm chart will now add the `nodeSelector`, `affinity` and `tolerations` values to the traffic-manager's\n  post-upgrade-hook and pre-delete-hook jobs.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence no longer fails to inject the traffic agent into the pod generated for workloads that have no\n  volumes and `automountServiceAccountToken: false`.\n\n- Feature: The helm-chart now supports settings resources, securityContext and podSecurityContext for use with chart hooks.\n\n### 2.6.7 (June 22, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: The Telepresence client will remember and reuse the traffic-manager session after a network failure\n  or other reason that caused an unclean disconnect.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will no longer forward DNS requests for \"wpad\" to the cluster.\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-agent will properly shut down if one of its goroutines errors.\n\n### 2.6.6 (June 9, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: The propagation of the `TELEPRESENCE_API_PORT` environment variable now works correctly.\n\n- Bugfix: The `--output json` global flag no longer outputs multiple objects.\n\n### 2.6.5 (June 3, 2022)\n\n- Feature: The `reinvocationPolicy` or the traffic-agent injector webhook can now be configured using the Helm chart.\n\n- Feature: The traffic manager now accepts a root CA for a proxy, allowing it to connect to ambassador cloud from behind an HTTPS proxy.\n  This can be configured through the helm chart.\n\n- Feature: A policy that controls when the mutating webhook injects the traffic-agent was added, and can be configured in the Helm chart.\n\n- Change: Telepresence on Windows upgraded wintun.dll from version 0.12 to version 0.14.1\n\n- Change: Telepresence on Windows upgraded winfsp from version 1.9 to 1.10\n\n- Change: Telepresence upgraded its embedded Helm from version 3.8.1 to 3.9\n\n- Change: Telepresence upgraded its embedded Kubernetes API from version 0.23.4 to 0.24.1\n\n- Feature: Added a `--watch` flag to `telepresence list` that can be used to watch interceptable workloads.\n\n- Change: The configuration setting for `images.webhookAgentImage` is now deprecated. Use `images.agentImage` instead.\n\n- Bugfix: The `reinvocationPolicy` or the traffic-agent injector webhook now defaults to `Never` insteadof `IfNeeded` so\n  that `LimitRange`s on namespaces can inject a missing `resources` element into the injected traffic-agent container.\n\n- Bugfix: UDP based communication with services in the cluster now works as expected.\n\n- Bugfix: The command help will only show Kubernetes flags on the commands that supports them\n\n- Bugfix: Only the errors from the last session will be considered when counting the number of errors in the log after\n  a command failure.\n\n### 2.6.4 (May 23, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-manager RBAC grants permissions to update services, deployments, replicatsets, and statefulsets. Those\n  permissions are needed when the traffic-manager upgrades from versions < 2.6.0 and can be revoked after the upgrade.\n\n### 2.6.3 (May 20, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: The `--mount` intercept flag now handles relative mount points correctly on non-windows platforms. Windows\n  still require the argument to be a drive letter followed by a colon.\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-agent's configuration update automatically when services are added, updated or deleted.\n\n- Bugfix: The `--mount` intercept flag now handles relative mount points correctly on non-windows platforms. Windows\n  still require the argument to be a drive letter followed by a colon.\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-agent's configuration update automatically when services are added, updated or deleted.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will now always inject an initContainer when the service's targetPort is numeric\n\n- Bugfix: Workloads that have several matching services pointing to the same target port are now handled correctly.\n\n- Bugfix: A potential race condition causing a panic when closing a DNS connection is now handled correctly.\n\n- Bugfix: A container start would sometimes fail because and old directory remained in a mounted temp volume.\n\n### 2.6.2 (May 17, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: Workloads controlled by workloads like Argo `Rollout` are injected correctly.\n\n- Bugfix: Multiple services appointing the same container port no longer result in duplicated ports in an injected pod.\n\n- Bugfix: The `telepresence list` command no longer errors out with \"grpc: received message larger than max\" when listing namespaces\n  with a large number of workloads.\n\n### 2.6.1 (May 16, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will now handle multiple path entries in the KUBECONFIG environment correctly.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will no longer panic when using preview URLs with traffic-managers < 2.6.0\n\n- Change: Traffic-manager now attempts to obtain a cluster id from the license if it could not obtain it from the Kubernetes API.\n\n### 2.6.0 (May 13, 2022)\n\n- Feature: Traffic-agent is now capable of intercepting multiple containers and multiple ports per container.\n\n- Feature: Telepresence client now require less RBAC permissions in order to intercept.\n\n- Change: All pod-injection is performed by the mutating webhook. Client will no longer modify workloads.\n\n- Change: Traffic-agent is configured using a ConfigMap entry. In prior versions, the configuration was passed in the container environment.\n\n- Change: The helm-chart no longer has a default set for the agentInjector.image.name, and unless its set, the traffic-manager will ask\n  SystemA for the preferred image.\n\n- Change: Client no longer needs RBAC permissions to update deployments, replicasets, and statefulsets.\n\n- Change: Telepresence now uses Helm version 3.8.1 when installing the traffic-manager\n\n- Change: The traffic-manager will not accept connections from clients older than 2.6.0. It can't, because they still use the old way of\n  injecting the agent by modifying the workload.\n\n- Change: When upgrading, all workloads with injected agents will have their agent \"uninstalled\" automatically. The mutating webhook will\n  then ensure that their pods will receive an updated traffic-agent.\n\n- Bugfix: Remote mounts will now function correctly with custom `securityContext`.\n\n- Bugfix: The help for commands that accept kubernetes flags will now display those flags in a separate group.\n\n- Bugfix: Using `telepresence leave` or `telepresence quit` on an intercept that spawned a command using `--` on the command line\n  will now terminate that command since it's considered parented by the intercept that is removed.\n\n- Change: Add support for structured output as JSON by setting the global --output=json flag.\n\n### 2.5.8 (April 27, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence now ensures that the download folder for the enhanced free client is created prior to downloading it.\n\n### 2.5.7 (April 25, 2022)\n\n- Change: A namespaced traffic-manager will no longer require cluster wide RBAC. Only Roles and RoleBindings are now used.\n\n- Bugfix: The DNS recursion detector didn't work correctly on Windows, resulting in sporadic failures to resolve names\n  that were resolved correctly at other times.\n\n- Bugfix: A telepresence session will now last for 24 hours after the user's last connectivity. If a session expires, the connector will automatically try to reconnect.\n\n### 2.5.6 (April 15, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: The `gather-logs` command will no longer send any logs through `gRPC`.\n\n- Change: Telepresence agents watcher will now only watch namespaces that the user has accessed since the last `connect`.\n\n### 2.5.5 (April 8, 2022)\n\n- Change: The traffic-manager now requires permissions to read pods across namespaces even if installed with limited permissions\n\n- Bugfix: The DNS resolver used on Linux with systemd-resolved now flushes the cache when the search path changes.\n\n- Bugfix: The `telepresence list` command will produce a correct listing even when not preceded by a `telepresence connect`.\n\n- Bugfix: The root daemon will no longer get into a bad state when a disconnect is rapidly followed by a new connect.\n\n- Bugfix: The client will now only watch agents from accessible namespaces, and is also constrained to namespaces explicitly mapped\n  using the `connect` command's `--mapped-namespaces` flag.\n\n- Bugfix: The `gather-logs` command will only gather traffic-agent logs from accessible namespaces, and is also constrained to namespaces\n  explicitly mapped using the `connect` command's `--mapped-namespaces` flag.\n\n### 2.5.4 (March 29, 2022)\n\n- Change: The list command, when used with the `--intercepts` flag, will list the users intercepts from all namespaces\n\n- Change: The status command includes the install id, user id, account id, and user email in its result, and can print output as JSON\n\n- Change: The lookup-timeout config flag used to set timeouts for DNS queries resolved by a cluster now also configures the timeout for fallback queries (i.e. queries not resolved by the cluster) when connected to the cluster.\n\n- Change: The TUN device will no longer route pod or service subnets if it is running in a machine that's already connected to the cluster\n\n- Bugfix: The client's gather logs command and agent watcher will now respect the configured grpc.maxReceiveSize\n\n- Bugfix: Client and agent sessions no longer leaves dangling waiters in the traffic-manager when they depart.\n\n- Bugfix: An advice to \"see logs for details\" is no longer printed when the argument count is incorrect in a CLI command.\n\n- Bugfix: Removed a bad concatenation that corrupted the output path of `telepresence gather-logs`.\n\n- Bugfix: Agent container is no longer sensitive to a random UID or an UID imposed by a SecurityContext.\n\n- Bugfix: Intercepts that fail to create are now consistently removed to prevent non-working dangling intercepts from sticking around.\n\n- Bugfix: The ingress-l5 flag will no longer be forcefully set to equal the --ingress-host flag\n\n- Bugfix: The DNS fallback resolver on Linux now correctly handles concurrent requests without timing them out\n\n### 2.5.3 (February 25, 2022)\n\n- Feature: Client-side binaries for the arm64 architecture are now available for linux\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed bug in the TCP stack causing timeouts after repeated connects to the same address\n\n### 2.5.2 (February 23, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a bug where Telepresence would use the last server in resolv.conf\n\n### 2.5.1 (February 19, 2022)\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a bug where using a GKE cluster would error with: No Auth Provider found for name \"gcp\"\n\n### 2.5.0 (February 18, 2022)\n\n- Feature: The flags `--http-path-equal`, `--http-path-prefix`, and `--http-path-regex` can can be used in addition to the `--http-match`\n  flag to filter personal intercepts by the request URL path\n\n- Feature: The flag `--http-meta` can be used to declare metadata key value pairs that will be returned by the Telepresence rest API\n  endpoint /intercept-info\n\n- Feature: Telepresence Login now prompts you to optionally install an enhanced free client, which has some additional features when used with Ambassador Cloud.\n\n- Change: Logs generated by the CLI are no longer discarded. Instead, they will end up in `cli.log`.\n\n- Change: Both daemon logfiles now rotate daily instead of once for each new connect\n\n- Change: The flag `--http-match` was renamed to `--http-header`. Old flag still works, but is deprecated and doesn't\n  show up in the help.\n\n- Change: The verb \"watch\" was added to the set of required verbs when accessing services and workloads for the client RBAC ClusterRole\n\n- Change: Telepresence is no longer backward compatible with versions 2.4.4 or older because the deprecated multiplexing tunnel functionality was removed.\n\n- Change: The global networking flags are no longer global.

Instead,\n  it is added as a `domain` so that names ending with it are routed to the DNS server.\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a bug where the `--json` flag did not output json for `telepresence list` when there were no workloads.\n\n- Change: Updated README file with more details about the project.\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a bug where the overriding DNS resolver would break down in Linux if /etc/resolv.conf listed an ipv6 resolver\n\n### 2.4.11 (February 10, 2022)\n\n- Change: Include goarch metadata for reporting to distinguish between Intel and Apple Silicon Macs\n\n### 2.4.10 (January 13, 2022)\n\n- Feature: The flag `--http-plaintext` can be used to ensure that an intercept uses plaintext http or grpc when\n  communicating with the workstation process.\n\n- Feature: The port used by default in the `telepresence intercept` command (8080), can now be changed by setting\n  the `intercept.defaultPort` in the `config.yml` file.\n\n- Feature: The strategy when selecting the application protocol for personal intercepts in agents injected by the\n  mutating webhook can now be configured using the `agentInjector.appProtocolStrategy` in the Helm chart.\n\n- Feature: The strategy when selecting the application protocol for personal intercepts can now be configured using\n  the `intercept.appProtocolStrategy` in the `config.yml` file.\n\n- Change: Telepresence CI now runs in GitHub Actions instead of Circle CI.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will no longer log invalid: \"unhandled connection control message: code DIAL_OK\" errors.\n\n- Bugfix: User will not be asked to log in or add ingress information when creating an intercept until a check has been\n  made that the intercept is possible.\n\n- Bugfix: Output to `stderr` from the traffic-agent's `sftp` and the client's `sshfs` processes are properly logged as errors.\n\n- Bugfix: Auto installer will no longer not emit backslash separators for the `/tel-app-mounts` paths in the\n  traffic-agent container spec when running on Windows\n\n### 2.4.9 (December 9, 2021)\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed an error where access tokens were not refreshed if you log in\n  while the daemons are already running.\n\n- Bugfix: A helm upgrade using the --reuse-values flag no longer fails on a \"nil pointer\" error caused by a nil `telpresenceAPI` value.\n\n### 2.4.8 (December 3, 2021)\n\n- Feature: A RESTful service was added to Telepresence, both locally to the client and to the `traffic-agent` to help determine if messages with a set of headers should be\n  consumed or not from a message queue where the intercept headers are added to the messages.\n\n- Change: The environment variable TELEPRESENCE_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID is no longer used.\n\n- Feature: There is a new subcommand, `test-vpn`, that can be used to diagnose connectivity issues with a VPN.\n\n- Bugfix: The tunneled network connections between Telepresence and\n  Ambassador Cloud now behave more like ordinary TCP connections,\n  especially around timeouts.\n\n### 2.4.7 (November 24, 2021)\n\n- Feature: The agent injector now supports a new annotation, `telepresence.getambassador.io/inject-service-name`, that can be used to set the name of the service to be intercepted.\n  This will help disambiguate which service to intercept for when a workload is exposed by multiple services, such as can happen with Argo Rollouts\n\n- Feature: The kubeconfig extensions now support a `never-proxy` argument, analogous to `also-proxy`, that defines a set of subnets that will never be proxied via telepresence.\n\n- Feature: Added flags to \"telepresence intercept\" that set the ingress fields as an alternative to using the dialogue.\n\n- Change: Telepresence check the versions of the client and the daemons and ask the user to quit and restart if they don't match.\n\n- Change: Telepresence DNS now uses a very short TTL instead of explicitly flushing DNS by killing the `mDNSResponder` or doing `resolvectl flush-caches`\n\n- Bugfix: Legacy flags such as `--swap-deployment` can now be used together with global flags.\n\n- Bugfix: Outbound connections are now properly closed when the peer closes.\n\n- Bugfix: The DNS-resolver will trap recursive resolution attempts (may happen when the cluster runs in a docker-container on the client).\n\n- Bugfix: The TUN-device will trap failed connection attempts that results in recursive calls back into the TUN-device (may happen when the\n  cluster runs in a docker-container on the client).\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a potential deadlock when a new agent joined the traffic manager.\n\n- Bugfix: The app-version value of the Helm chart embedded in the telepresence binary is now automatically updated at build time. The value is hardcoded in the\n  original Helm chart when we release so this fix will only affect our nightly builds.\n\n- Bugfix: The configured webhookRegistry is now propagated to the webhook installer even if no webhookAgentImage has been set.\n\n- Bugfix: Login logs the user in when their access token has expired, instead of having no effect.\n\n### 2.4.6 (November 2, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Telepresence CLI is now built and published for Apple Silicon Macs.\n\n- Feature: Telepresence now supports manually injecting the traffic-agent YAML into workload manifests.\n  Use the `genyaml` command to create the sidecar YAML, then add the `telepresence.getambassador.io/manually-injected: \"true\"` annotation to your pods to allow Telepresence to intercept them.\n\n- Feature: Added a json flag for the \"telepresence list\" command. This will aid automation.\n\n- Change: `--help` text now includes a link to https://www.telepresence.io/ so users who download Telepresence via Brew or some other mechanism are able to find the documentation easily.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will no longer attempt to proxy requests to the API server when it happens to have an IP address within the CIDR range of pods/services.\n\n### 2.4.5 (October 15, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Intercepting headless services is now supported. It's now possible to request a headless service on whatever port it exposes and get a response from the intercept.\n\n- Feature: Preview url questions have more context and provide \"best guess\" defaults.\n\n- Feature: The `gather-logs` command added two new flags. One to anonymize pod names + namespaces and the other for getting the pod yaml of the `traffic-manager` and any pod that contains a `traffic-agent`.\n\n- Change: Use one tunnel per connection instead of multiplexing into one tunnel. This client will still be backwards compatible with older `traffic-manager`s that only support multiplexing.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will now log that the kubernetes server version is unsupported when using a version older than 1.17.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence only adds the security context when necessary: intercepting a headless service or using a numeric port with the webhook agent injector.\n\n### 2.4.4 (September 27, 2021)\n\n- Feature: The strategy used by traffic-manager's discovery of pod CIDRs can now be configured using the Helm chart.\n\n- Feature: Add the command `telepresence gather-logs`, which bundles the logs for all components\n  into one zip file that can then be shared in a GitHub issue, in slack, etc. Use\n  `telepresence gather-logs --help` to see additional options for running the command.\n\n- Feature: The agent injector now supports injecting Traffic Agents into pods that have unnamed ports.\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic-manager now uses less CPU-cycles when computing the pod CIDRs.\n\n- Bugfix: If a deployment annotated with webhook annotations is deployed before telepresence is installed, telepresence will now install an agent in that deployment before intercept\n\n- Bugfix: Fix an issue where the traffic-manager would sometimes go into a CPU loop.\n\n- Bugfix: The TUN-device no longer builds an unlimited internal buffer before sending it when receiving lots of TCP-packets without PSH.\n  Instead, the buffer is flushed when it reaches a size of 64K.\n\n- Bugfix: The user daemon would sometimes hang when it encountered a problem connecting to the cluster or the root daemon.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence correctly reports an intercept port conflict instead of panicking with segfault.\n\n### 2.4.3 (September 15, 2021)\n\n- Feature: The environment variable `TELEPRESENCE_INTERCEPT_ID` is now available in the interceptor's environment.\n\n- Bugfix: A timing related bug was fixed that sometimes caused a \"daemon did not start\" failure.\n\n- Bugfix: On Windows, crash stack traces and other errors were not\n  written to the log files, now they are.\n\n- Bugfix: On Linux kernel 4.11 and above, the log file rotation now\n  properly reads the birth-time of the log file. On older kernels, it\n  continues to use the old behavior of using the change-time in place\n  of the birth-time.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will no longer refer the user to the daemon logs for errors that aren't related to\n  problems that are logged there.\n\n- Bugfix: The overriding DNS resolver will no longer apply search paths when resolving \"localhost\".\n\n- Bugfix: The cluster domain used by the DNS resolver is retrieved from the traffic-manager instead of being\n  hard-coded to \"cluster.local\".\n\n- Bugfix: \"Telepresence uninstall --everything\" now also uninstalls agents installed via mutating webhook\n\n- Bugfix: Downloading large files during an intercept will no longer cause timeouts and hanging traffic-agent.\n\n- Bugfix: Passing false to the intercept command's --mount flag will no longer result in a filesystem being mounted.\n\n- Bugfix: The traffic manager will establish outbound connections in parallel instead of sequentially.\n\n- Bugfix: The `telepresence status` command reports correct DNS settings instead of \"Local IP: nil, Remote IP: nil\"\n\n### 2.4.2 (September 1, 2021)\n\n- Feature: A new `telepresence loglevel <level>` subcommand was added that enables changing the loglevel\n  temporarily for the local daemons, the `traffic-manager` and the `traffic-agents`.\n\n- Change: The default log-level is now `info` for all components of Telepresence.\n\n- Bugfix: The overriding DNS resolver will no longer apply search paths when resolving \"localhost\".\n\n- Bugfix: The RBAC was not updated in the helm chart to enable the traffic-manager to `get` and `list`\n  namespaces, which would impact users who use licensed features of the Telepresence extensions in an\n  air-gapped environment.\n\n- Bugfix: The timeout for Helm actions wasn't always respected which could cause a failing install of the\n  `traffic-manager` to make the user daemon to hang indefinitely.\n\n### 2.4.1 (August 30, 2021)\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will now mount all directories from `/var/run/secrets`, not just the kubernetes.io ones.\n  This allows the mounting of secrets directories such as eks.amazonaws.com (for IRSA tokens)\n\n- Bugfix: The grpc.maxReceiveSize setting is now correctly propagated to all grpc servers.\n  This allows users to mitigate a root daemon crash when sending a message over the default maximum size.\n\n- Bugfix: Some slight fixes to the `homebrew-package.sh` script which will enable us to run\n  it manually if we ever need to make homebrew point at an older version.\n\n- Feature: Helm chart has now a feature to on demand regenerate certificate used for mutating webhook by setting value.\n  `agentInjector.certificate.regenerate`\n\n- Change: The traffic-manager now requires `get` namespace permissions to get the cluster ID instead of that value being\n  passed in as an environment variable to the traffic-manager's deployment.\n\n- Change: The traffic-manager is now installed via an embedded version of the Helm chart when `telepresence connect` is first performed on a cluster.\n  This change is transparent to the user.\n  A new configuration flag, `timeouts.helm` sets the timeouts for all helm operations performed by the Telepresence binary.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will initialize the default namespace from the kubeconfig on each call instead of just doing it when connecting.\n\n- Bugfix: The timeout to keep idle outbound TCP connections alive was increased from 60 to 7200 seconds which is the same as\n  the Linux `tcp_keepalive_time` default.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will now remove a socket that is the result of an ungraceful termination and retry instead of printing\n  an error saying \"this usually means that the process has terminated ungracefully\"\n\n- Change: Failure to report metrics is logged using loglevel info rather than error.\n\n- Bugfix: A potential deadlock situation is fixed that sometimes caused the user daemon to hang when the user\n  was logged in.\n\n- Feature: The scout reports will now include additional metadata coming from environment variables starting with\n  `TELEPRESENCE_REPORT_`.\n\n- Bugfix: The config setting `images.agentImage` is no longer required to contain the repository. The repository is\n  instead picked from `images.repository`.\n\n- Change: The `registry`, `webhookRegistry`, `agentImage` and `webhookAgentImage` settings in the `images` group of the `config.yml`\n  now get their defaults from `TELEPRESENCE_AGENT_IMAGE` and `TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY`.\n\n### 2.4.0 (August 4, 2021)\n\n- Feature: There is now a native Windows client for Telepresence.\n  All the same features supported by the macOS and Linux client are available on Windows.\n\n- Feature: Telepresence can now receive messages from the cloud and raise\n  them to the user when they perform certain commands.\n\n- Bugfix: Initialization of `systemd-resolved` based DNS sets\n  routing domain to improve stability in non-standard configurations.\n\n- Bugfix: Edge case error when targeting a container by port number.\n  Before if your matching/target container was at containers list index 0,\n  but if there was a container at index 1 with no ports, then the\n  \"no ports\" container would end up the selected one\n\n- Bugfix: A `$(NAME)` reference in the agent's environment will now be\n  interpolated correctly.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will no longer print an INFO level log message when\n  no config.yml file is found.\n\n- Bugfix: A panic is no longer raised when passing an argument to the\n  `telepresence intercept` option `--http-match` that doesn't contain an\n  equal sign.\n\n- Bugfix: The `traffic-manager` will only send subnet updates to a\n  client root daemon when the subnets actually change.\n\n- Bugfix: The agent uninstaller now distinguishes between recoverable\n  and unrecoverable failures, allowing uninstallation from manually changed\n  resources\n\n### 2.3.7 (July 23, 2021)\n\n- Feature: An `also-proxy` entry in the Kubernetes cluster config will\n  show up in the output of the `telepresence status` command.\n\n- Feature: `telepresence login` now has an `--apikey=KEY` flag that\n  allows for non-interactive logins. This is useful for headless\n  environments where launching a web-browser is impossible, such as\n  cloud shells, Docker containers, or CI.\n\n- Bugfix: Dialer will now close if it gets a ConnectReject. This was\n  encountered when doing an intercept without a local process running\n  and would result in requests hanging indefinitely.\n\n- Bugfix: Made `telepresence list` command faster.\n\n- Bugfix: Mutating webhook injector correctly hides named ports for probes.\n\n- Bugfix: Initialization of `systemd-resolved` based DNS is more stable and\n  failures causing telepresence to default to the overriding resolver will no\n  longer cause general DNS lookup failures.\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a regression introduced in 2.3.5 that caused `telepresence current-cluster-id`\n  to crash.\n\n- Bugfix: New API keys generated internally for communication with\n  Ambassador Cloud no longer show up as \"no description\" in the\n  Ambassador Cloud web UI. Existing API keys generated by older\n  versions of Telepresence will still show up this way.\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a race condition that logging in and logging out\n  rapidly could cause memory corruption or corruption of the\n  `user-info.json` cache file used when authenticating with Ambassador\n  Cloud.\n\n### 2.3.6 (July 20, 2021)\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a regression introduced in 2.3.5 that caused preview\n  URLs to not work.\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a regression introduced in 2.3.5 where the Traffic\n  Manager's `RoleBinding` did not correctly appoint the\n  `traffic-manager` `Role`, causing subnet discovery to not be able to\n  work correctly.\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed a regression introduced in 2.3.5 where the root daemon\n  did not correctly read the configuration file; ignoring the user's\n  configured log levels and timeouts.\n\n- Bugfix: Fixed an issue that could cause the user daemon to crash\n  during shutdown, as during shutdown it unconditionally attempted to\n  close a channel even though the channel might already be closed.\n\n### 2.3.5 (July 15, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Telepresence no longer depends on having an external\n  `kubectl` binary, which might not be present for OpenShift users\n  (who have `oc` instead of `kubectl`).\n- Feature: `skipLogin` can be used in the config.yml to tell the cli not to connect to cloud when using an air-gapped environment.\n- Feature: The Telepresence Helm chart now supports installing multiple\n  Traffic Managers in multiple namespaces. This will allow operators to\n  install Traffic Managers with limited permissions that match the\n  permissions restrictions that Telepresence users are subject to.\n- Feature: The maximum size of messages that the client can receive over gRPC can now be configured. The gRPC default of 4MB isn't enough\n  under some circumstances.\n- Change: `TELEPRESENCE_AGENT_IMAGE` and `TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY` are now only configurable via config.yml.\n- Bugfix: Fixed and improved several error messages, to hopefully be\n  more helpful.\n- Bugfix: Fixed a DNS problem on macOS causing slow DNS lookups when connecting to a local cluster.\n\n### 2.3.4 (July 9, 2021)\n\n- Bugfix: Some log statements that contained garbage instead of a proper IP address now produce the correct address.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will no longer panic when multiple services match a workload.\n- Bugfix: The traffic-manager will now accurately determine the service subnet by creating a dummy-service in its own namespace.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence connect will no longer try to update the traffic-manager's clusterrole if the live one is identical to the desired one.\n- Bugfix: The Telepresence helm chart no longer fails when installing with `--set clientRbac.namespaced=true`\n\n### 2.3.3 (July 7, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Telepresence now supports installing the Traffic Manager\n  via Helm. This will make it easy for operators to install and\n  configure the server-side components of Telepresence separately from\n  the CLI (which in turn allows for better separation of permissions).\n\n- Feature: As the `traffic-manager` can now be installed in any\n  namespace via Helm, Telepresence can now be configured to look for\n  the traffic manager in a namespace other than `ambassador`. This\n  can be configured on a per-cluster basis.\n\n- Feature: `telepresence intercept` now supports a `--to-pod` flag\n  that can be used to port-forward sidecars' ports from an intercepted\n  pod\n\n- Feature: `telepresence status` now includes more information about\n  the root daemon.\n\n- Feature: We now do nightly builds of Telepresence for commits on release/v2 that haven't been tagged and published yet.\n\n- Change: Telepresence no longer automatically shuts down the old\n  `api_version=1` `edgectl` daemon. If migrating from such an old\n  version of `edgectl` you must now manually shut down the `edgectl`\n  daemon before running Telepresence. This was already the case when\n  migrating from the newer `api_version=2` `edgectl`.\n\n- Bugfix: The root daemon no longer terminates when the user daemon\n  disconnects from its gRPC streams, and instead waits to be\n  terminated by the CLI. This could cause problems with things not\n  being cleaned up correctly.\n\n- Bugfix: An intercept will survive deletion of the intercepted pod\n  provided that another pod is created (or already exists) that can\n  take over.\n\n### 2.3.2 (June 18, 2021)\n\n- Feature: The mutator webhook for injecting traffic-agents now\n  recognizes a `telepresence.getambassador.io/inject-service-port`\n  annotation to specify which port to intercept; bringing the\n  functionality of the `--port` flag to users who use the mutator\n  webook in order to control Telepresence via GitOps.\n\n- Feature: Outbound connections are now routed through the intercepted\n  Pods which means that the connections originate from that Pod from\n  the cluster's perspective. This allows service meshes to correctly\n  identify the traffic.\n\n- Change: Inbound connections from an intercepted agent are now\n  tunneled to the manager over the existing gRPC connection, instead\n  of establishing a new connection to the manager for each inbound\n  connection. This avoids interference from certain service mesh\n  configurations.\n\n- Change: The traffic-manager requires RBAC permissions to list Nodes,\n  Pods, and to create a dummy Service in the manager's namespace.\n\n- Change: The on-laptop client no longer requires RBAC permissions to\n  list Nodes in the cluster or to create Services, as that\n  functionality has been moved to the traffic-manager.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will now detect the pod CIDR ranges even if\n  they are not listed in the Nodes.\n\n- Bugfix: The list of cluster subnets that the virtual network\n  interface will route is now configured dynamically and will follow\n  changes in the cluster.\n\n- Bugfix: Subnets fully covered by other subnets are now pruned\n  internally and thus never superfluously added to the laptop's\n  routing table.\n\n- Change: The `trafficManagerAPI` timout default has changed from 5\n  seconds to 15 seconds, in order to facilitate the extended time it\n  takes for the traffic-manager to do its initial discovery of cluster\n  info as a result of the above bugfixes.\n\n- Bugfix: On macOS, files generated under `/etc/resolver/` as the\n  result of using `include-suffixes` in the cluster config are now\n  properly removed on quit.\n\n- Bugfix: Telepresence no longer erroneously terminates connections\n  early when sending a large HTTP response from an intercepted\n  service.\n\n- Bugfix: When shutting down the user-daemon or root-daemon on the\n  laptop, `telepresence quit` and related commands no longer return\n  early before everything is fully shut down. Now it can be counted\n  on that by the time the command has returned that all the\n  side-effects on the laptop have been cleaned up.\n\n### 2.3.1 (June 14, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Agents can now be installed using a mutator webhook\n- Feature: DNS resolver can now be configured with respect to what IP addresses that are used, and what lookups that gets sent to the cluster.\n- Feature: Telepresence can now be configured to proxy subnets that aren't part of the cluster but only accesible from the cluster.\n- Change: The `trafficManagerConnect` timout default has changed from 20 seconds to 60 seconds, in order to facilitate\n  the extended time it takes to apply everything needed for the mutator webhook.\n- Change: Telepresence is now installable via `brew install datawire/blackbird/telepresence`\n- Bugfix: Fix a bug where sometimes large transfers from services on the cluster would hang indefinitely\n\n### 2.3.0 (June 1, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Telepresence is now installable via brew\n- Feature: `telepresence version` now also includes the version of the currently running user daemon.\n- Change: A TUN-device is used instead of firewall rules for routing outbound connections.\n- Change: Outbound connections now use gRPC instead of ssh, and the traffic-manager no longer has a sshd running.\n- Change: The traffic-agent no longer has a sshd running. Remote volume mounts use sshfs in slave mode, talking directly to sftp.\n- Change: The local DNS now routes the name lookups to intercepted agents or traffic-manager.\n- Change: The default log-level for the traffic-manager and the root-daemon was changed from \"debug\" to \"info\".\n- Change: The command line is now statically-linked, so it is usable on systems with different libc's.\n- Bugfix: Using --docker-run no longer fail to mount remote volumes when docker runs as root.\n- Bugfix: Fixed a number of race conditions.\n- Bugfix: Fix a crash when there is an error communicating with the traffic-manager about Ambassador Cloud.\n- Bugfix: Fix a bug where sometimes when displaying or logging a timeout error it fails to determine which configurable timeout is responsible.\n- Bugfix: The root-user daemon now respects the timeouts in the normal user's configuration file.\n\n### 2.2.2 (May 17, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Telepresence translates legacy Telepresence commands into viable Telepresence commands.\n- Bugfix: Intercepts will only look for agents that are in the same namespace as the intercept.\n\n### 2.2.1 (April 29, 2021)\n\n- Bugfix: Improve `ambassador` namespace detection that was trying to create the namespace even when the namespace existed, which was an undesired RBAC escalation for operators.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will now no longer generate excessive traffic trying repeatedly to exchange auth tokens with Ambassador Cloud. This could happen when upgrading from <2.1.4 if you had an expired `telepresence login` from before upgrading.\n- Bugfix: `telepresence login` now correctly handles expired logins, just like all of the other subcommands.\n\n### 2.2.0 (April 19, 2021)\n\n- Feature: `telepresence intercept` now has the option `--docker-run` which will start a docker container with intercepted environment and volume mounts.\n- Bugfix: `telepresence uninstall` can once again uninstall agents installed by older versions of Telepresence.\n- Feature: Addition of `telepresence current-cluster-id` and `telepresence license` commands for using licenses with the Ambassador extension, primarily in air-gapped environments.\n\n### 2.1.5 (April 12, 2021)\n\n- Feature: When intercepting `--port` now supports specifying a service port or a service name. Previously, only service name was supported.\n- Feature: Intercepts using `--mechanism=http` now support mTLS.\n- Bugfix: One of the log messages was using the incorrect variable, which led to misleading error messages on `telepresence uninstall`.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence no longer generates port names longer than 15 characters.\n\n### 2.1.4 (April 5, 2021)\n\n- Feature: `telepresence status` has been enhanced to provide more information. In particular, it now provides separate information on the daemon and connector processes, as well as showing login status.\n- Feature: Telepresence now supports intercepting StatefulSets\n- Change: Telepresence necessary RBAC has been refined to support StatefulSets and now requires \"get,list,update\" for StatefulSets\n- Change: Telepresence no longer requires that port 1080 must be available.\n- Change: Telepresence now makes use of refresh tokens to avoid requiring the user to manually log in so often.\n- Bugfix: Fix race condition that occurred when intercepting a ReplicaSet while another pod was terminating in the same namespace (this fixes a transient test failure)\n- Bugfix: Fix error when intercepting a ReplicaSet requires the containerPort to be hidden.\n- Bugfix: `telepresence quit` no longer starts the daemon process just to shut it down.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence no longer hangs the next time it's run after getting killed.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence now does a better job of automatically logging in as necessary, especially with regard to expired logins.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence was incorrectly looking across all namespaces for services when intercepting, but now it only looks in the given namespace. This should prevent people from running into \"Found multiple services\" errors when services with the same selectors existed in other namespaces.\n\n### 2.1.3 (March 29, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Telepresence now supports intercepting ReplicaSets (that aren't owned by a Deployment)\n- Change: The --deployment (-d) flag is now --workload (-w), as we start supporting more workloads than just Deployments\n- Change: Telepresence necessary RBAC has changed and now requires \"delete\" for Pods and \"get,list,update\" for ReplicaSets\n- Security: Upgrade to a newer OpenSSL, to address OpenSSL CVE-2021-23840.\n- Bugfix: Connecting to Minikube/Hyperkit no longer fails intermittently.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will now make /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io available when mounting remote volumes.\n- Bugfix: Hiccups in the connection to the cluster will no longer cause the connector to shut down; it now retries properly.\n- Bugfix: Fix a crash when binary dependencies are missing.\n- Bugfix: You can now specify a service when doing an intercept (--service), this is useful if you have two services that select on the same labels (e.g. If using Argo Rollouts do deployments)\n\n### 2.1.2 (March 19, 2021)\n\n- Bugfix: Uninstalling agents now only happens once per deployment instead of once per agent.\n- Bugfix: The list command no longer shows agents from namespaces that aren't mapped.\n- Bugfix: IPv6 routes now work and don't prevent other pfctl rules being written in macOS\n- Bugfix: Pods with `hostname` and/or `subdomain` now get correct DNS-names and routes.\n- Change: Service UID was added to InterceptSpec to better link intercepts and services.\n- Feature: All timeouts can now be configured in a <user-config-dir>/telepresence/config.yml file\n\n### 2.1.1 (March 12, 2021)\n\n- Bugfix: When looking at the container to intercept, it will check if there's a better match before using a container without containerPorts.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence will now map `kube-*` and `ambassador` namespaces by default.\n- Bugfix: Service port declarations that lack a TargetPort field will now correctly default to using the Port field instead.\n- Bugfix: Several DNS fixes. Notably, introduce a fake \"tel2-search\" domain that gets replaced with a dynamic DNS search when queried, which fixes DNS for Docker with no `-net host`.\n- Change: Improvements to how we report the requirements for volume mounts; notably, if the requirements are not met then it defaults to `--mount=false`.\n- Change: There has been substantial code cleanup in the \"connector\" process.\n\n### 2.1.0 (March 8, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Support headless services (including ExternalName), which you can use if you used \"Also Proxy\" in telepresence 1.\n- Feature: Preview URLs can now set a layer-5 hostname (TLS-SNI and HTTP \"Host\" header) that is different than the layer-3 hostname (IP-address/DNS-name) that is used to dial to the ingress.\n- Feature: The Ingress info will now contain a layer-5 hostname that can be used for TLS-SLI and HTTP \"Host\" header when accessing a service.\n- Feature: Users can choose which port to intercept when intercepting a service with multiple ports.\n- Bugfix: Environment variables declared with `envFrom` in the app-container are now propagated correctly to the client during intercept.\n- Bugfix: The description of the `--everything` flag for the `uninstall` command was corrected.\n- Bugfix: Connecting to a large cluster could take a very long time and even make the process hang. This is no longer the case.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence now explicitly requires macFUSE version 4.0.5 or higher for macOS.\n- Bugfix: A `tail -F <daemon log file>` no longer results in a \"Permission denied\" when reconnecting to the cluster.\n- Change: The telepresence daemon will no longer use port 1234 for the firewall-to-SOCKS server, but will instead choose an available port dynamically.\n- Change: On connect, telepresence will no longer suggest the `--mapped-namespaces` flag when the user connects to a large cluster.\n\n### 2.0.3 (February 24, 2021)\n\n- Feature: There is now an extension mechanism where you can tell Telepresence about different agents and what arguments they support. The new `--mechanism` flag can explicitly identify which extension to use.\n- Feature: An intercept of `NAME` that is made using `--namespace=NAMESPACE` but not using `--deployment` will use `NAME` as the name of the deployment and `NAME-NAMESPACE` as the name of the intercept.\n- Feature: Declare a local-only intercept for the purpose of getting direct outbound access to the intercept's namespace using boolean flag `--local-only`.\n- Bugfix: Fix a regression in the DNS resolver that prevented name resolution using NAME.NAMESPACE. Instead, NAME.NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local was required.\n- Bugfix: Fixed race-condition in the agent causing attempts to dial to `:0`.\n- Bugfix: It is now more strict about which agent versions are acceptable and will be more eager to apply upgrades.\n- Change: Related to things now being in extensions, the `--match` flag has been renamed to `--http-match`.\n- Change: Cluster connection timeout has been increased from 10s to 20s.\n- Change: On connect, if telepresence detects a large cluster, it will suggest the `--mapped-namespaces` flag to the user as a way to speed it up.\n- Change: The traffic-agent now has a readiness probe associated with its container.\n\n### 2.0.2 (February 18, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Telepresence is now capable of forwarding the intercepted Pod's volume mounts (as Telepresence 0.x did) via the `--mount` flag to `telepresence intercept`.\n- Feature: Telepresence will now allow simultaneous intercepts in different namespaces.\n- Feature: It is now possible for a user to limit what namespaces that will be used by the DNS-resolver and the NAT.\n- Bugfix: Fix the kubectl version number check to handle version numbers with a \"+\" in them.\n- Bugfix: Fix a bug with some configurations on macOS where we clash with mDNSResponder's use of port 53.\n\n### 2.0.1 (February 9, 2021)\n\n- Feature: Telepresence is now capable of forwarding the environment variables of an intercepted service (as Telepresence 0.x did) and emit them to a file as text or JSON. The environment variables will also be propagated to any command started by doing a `telepresence intercept nnn -- <command>`.\n- Bugfix: A bug causing a failure in the Telepresence DNS resolver when attempting to listen to the Docker gateway IP was fixed. The fix affects Windows using a combination of Docker and WSL2 only.\n- Bugfix: Telepresence now works correctly while OpenVPN is running on macOS.\n- Change: The background processes `connector` and `daemon` will now use rotating logs and a common directory.\n  - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/telepresence/`\n  - Linux: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/telepresence/logs/` or `$HOME/.cache/telepresence/logs/`\n"

The definition is now unified to the mutual exclusive top-level\n          Helm chart values `namespaces` and `namespaceSelector`.\n          \n          The `namespaces` value is just for convenience and a short form of expressing:\n          ```yaml\n          namespaceSelector:\n            matchExpressions:\n             - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name\n               operator: in\n               values: <namespaces>`.\n          ```\n        docs: install/manager#static-versus-dynamic-namespace-selection\n      - type: feature\n        title: Removal of the dormant container during intercept with --replace.\n        body: |-\n          During a `telepresence intercept --replace operation`, the previously injected dormant container has been\n          removed. The Traffic Agent now directly serves as the replacement container, eliminating the need to forward\n          traffic to the original application container. This simplification offers several advantages when using the\n          `--replace` flag:\n          \n          - **Removal of the init-container:** The need for a separate init-container is no longer necessary.\n          - **Elimination of port renames:** Port renames within the intercepted pod are no longer required.\n      - type: change\n        title: Drop deprecated current-cluster-id command.\n        body: >-\n          The clusterID was deprecated some time ago, and replaced by the ID of the namespace where the traffic-manager\n          is installed.\n      - type: bugfix\n        title: Conflict detection between namespaced and cluster-wide install.\n        body: >-\n          The namespace conflict detection mechanism would only discover conflicts between two _namespaced_ Traffic\n          Managers trying to manage the same namespace.

This was counterintuitive and the requirement was removed. An ingest doesn't use a port.\n        docs: https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3741\n      - type: bugfix\n        title: Upgrade module dependencies to get rid of critical vulnerability.\n        body: >-\n          Upgrade module dependencies to latest available stable. This includes upgrading golang.org/x/crypto, which\n          had critical issues, from 0.30.0 to 0.31.0 where those issues are resolved.\n  - version: 2.21.0\n    date: 2024-12-13\n    notes:\n      - type: feature\n        title: Automatic VPN conflict avoidance\n        body: >-\n          Telepresence not only detects subnet conflicts between the cluster and workstation VPNs but also resolves them\n          by performing network address translation to move conflicting subnets out of the way.\n        docs: reference/vpn\n      - type: feature\n        title: Virtual Address Translation (VNAT).\n        body: >-\n          It is now possible to use a virtual subnet without routing the affected IPs to a specific workload. A new\n          `telepresence connect --vnat CIDR` flag was added that will perform virtual network address translation of\n          cluster IPs. This flag is very similar to the `--proxy-via CIDR=WORKLOAD` introduced in 2.19, but without\n          the need to specify a workload.\n        docs: reference/vpn\n      - type: feature\n        title: Intercepts targeting a specific container\n        body: |-\n          In certain scenarios, the container owning the intercepted port differs\n          from the container the intercept targets. This port owner's sole purpose\n          is to route traffic from the service to the intended container, often\n          using a direct localhost connection.\n\n          This update introduces a `--container <name>` option to the intercept\n          command. While this option doesn't influence the port selection, it\n          guarantees that the environment variables and mounts propagated to the\n          client originate from the specified container. Additionally, if the\n          `--replace` option is used, it ensures that this container is replaced.\n        docs: reference/intercepts/container\n      - type: feature\n        title: New telepresence ingest command\n        body: >-\n          The new `telepresence ingest` command, similar to `telepresence intercept`, provides local access to the\n          volume mounts and environment variables of a targeted container. However, unlike `telepresence intercept`,\n          `telepresence ingest` does not redirect traffic to the container and ensures that the mounted volumes are\n          read-only.\n\n          An ingest requires a traffic-agent to be installed in the pods of the targeted workload. Beyond that, it's\n          a client-side operation. This allows developers to have multiple simultaneous ingests on the same container.\n        docs: howtos/intercepts#ingest-your-service\n      - type: feature\n        title: New telepresence curl command\n        body: >-\n          The new `telepresence curl` command runs curl from within a container. The command requires that a connection\n          has been established using `telepresence connect --docker`, and the container that runs `curl` will share the\n          same network as the containerized telepresence daemon.\n        docs: reference/docker-run#the-telepresence-curl-command\n      - type: feature\n        title: New telepresence docker-run command\n        body: >-\n          The new `telepresence docker-run <flags and arguments>` requires that a connection has been established using\n          `telepresence connect --docker` It will perform a `docker run <flags and arguments>` and add the flag necessary\n          to ensure that started container shares the same network as the containerized telepresence daemon.\n        docs: reference/docker-run#the-telepresence-docker-run-command\n      - type: feature\n        title: Mount everything read-only during intercept\n        body: >-\n          It is now possible to append \":ro\" to the intercept `--mount` flag value. This ensures that all remote volumes\n          that the intercept mounts are read-only.\n      - type: feature\n        title: Unify client configuration\n        body: >-\n          Previously, client configuration was divided between the config.yml file and a Kubernetes extension. DNS and\n          routing settings were initially found only in the extension. However, the Helm client structure allowed\n          entries from both.\n\n          To simplify this, we've now aligned the config.yml and Kubernetes extension with the Helm client structure.\n          This means DNS and routing settings are now included in both. The Kubernetes extension takes precedence over\n          the config.yml and Helm client object.\n\n          While the old-style Kubernetes extension is still supported for compatibility, it cannot be used with the new\n          style.\n        docs: reference/config\n      - type: feature\n        title: Use WebSockets for port-forward instead of the now deprecated SPDY.\n        body: >-\n          Telepresence will now use WebSockets instead of SPDY when creating port-forwards to the Kubernetes Cluster, and\n          will fall back to SPDY when connecting to clusters that don't support SPDY. Use of the deprecated SPDY can be\n          forced by setting `cluster.forceSPDY=true` in the `config.yml`.\n\n          See [Streaming Transitions from SPDY to WebSockets](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/20/websockets-transition/)\n          for more information about this transition.\n      - type: feature\n        title: Make usage data collection configurable using an extension point, and default to no-ops\n        body: >-\n          The OSS code-base will no longer report usage data to the proprietary collector at Ambassador Labs. The actual calls\n          to the collector remain, but will be no-ops unless a proper collector client is installed using an extension point.\n      - type: feature\n        title: Add deployments, statefulSets, replicaSets to workloads Helm chart value\n        body: >-\n          The Helm chart value `workloads` now supports the kinds `deployments.enabled`, `statefulSets.enabled`, `replicaSets.enabled`.\n          and `rollouts.enabled`. All except `rollouts` are enabled by default. The traffic-manager will ignore workloads, and\n          Telepresence will not be able to intercept them, if the `enabled` of the corresponding kind is set to `false`.\n        docs: reference/intercepts/sidecar#disable-workloads\n      - type: feature\n        title: Improved command auto-completion\n        body: >-\n          The auto-completion of namespaces, services, and containers have been added where appropriate, and the default\n          file auto completion has been removed from most commands.\n      - type: feature\n        title: Docker run flags --publish, --expose, and --network now work with docker mode connections\n        body: >-\n          After establishing a connection to a cluster using `telepresence connect --docker`, you can run new containers that share\n          the same network as the containerized daemon that maintains the connection. This enables seamless communication between\n          your local development environment and the remote services.\n\n          Normally, Docker has a limitation that prevents combining a shared network configuration with custom networks\n          and exposing ports. However, Telepresence now elegantly circumvents this limitation so that a container started with\n          `telepresence docker-run`, `telepresence intercept --docker-run`, or `telepresence ingest --docker-run` can use flags\n          like `--network`, `--publish`, or `--expose`.\n\n          To achieve this, Telepresence temporarily adds the necessary network to the containerized daemon. This allows the new\n          container to join the same network. Additionally, Telepresence starts extra socat containers to handle port mapping,\n          ensuring that the desired ports are exposed to the local environment.\n        docs: reference/docker-run#the-telepresence-docker-run-command\n      - type: feature\n        title: Prevent recursion in the Telepresence Virtual Network Interface (VIF)\n        body: >-\n          Network problems may arise when running Kubernetes locally (e.g., Docker Desktop, Kind, Minikube, k3s),\n          because the VIF on the host is also accessible from the cluster's nodes. A request that isn't handled by a\n          cluster resource might be routed back into the VIF and cause a recursion.\n\n          These recursions can now be prevented by setting the client configuration property\n          `routing.recursionBlockDuration` so that new connection attempts are temporarily blocked for a specific\n          IP:PORT pair immediately after an initial attempt, thereby effectively ending the recursion.\n        docs: howtos/cluster-in-vm\n      - type: feature\n        title: Allow Helm chart to be included as a sub-chart\n        body: >-\n          The Helm chart previously had the unnecessary restriction that the .Release.Name under which telepresence is installed is literally\n          called \"traffic-manager\".  This restriction was preventing telepresence from being included as a sub-chart in a parent chart\n          called anything but \"traffic-manager\". This restriction has been lifted.\n      - type: feature\n        title: Add Windows arm64 client build\n        body: >-\n          Telepresence client is now available for Windows ARM64.\n          Updated the release workflow files in github actions to build and publish the Windows ARM64 client.\n      - type: change\n        title: The --agents flag to telepresence uninstall is now the default.\n        body: >-\n          The `telepresence uninstall` was once capable of uninstalling the traffic-manager as well as traffic-agents.\n          This behavior has been deprecated for some time now and in this release, the command is all about uninstalling\n          the agents. Therefore the `--agents` flag was made redundant and whatever arguments that are given to the\n          command must be name of workloads that have an agent installed unless the `--all-agents` is used, in which\n          case no arguments are allowed.\n      - type: change\n        title: Performance improvement for the telepresence list command\n        body: >-\n          The `telepresence list` command will now retrieve its data from the traffic-manager, which significantly\n          improves its performance when used on namespaces that have a lot of workloads.\n      - type: change\n        title: During an intercept, the local port defaults to the targeted port of the intercepted container instead of 8080.\n        body: >-\n          Telepresence mimics the environment of a target container during an intercept, so it's only natural that the default\n          for the local port is determined by the targeted container port rather than just defaulting to 8080.\n\n          A default can still be explicitly defined using the `config.intercept.defaultPort` setting.\n      - type: change\n        title: Move the telepresence-intercept-env configmap data into traffic-manager configmap.\n        body: >-\n          There's no need for two configmaps that store configuration data for the traffic manager. The traffic-manager\n          configmap is also watched, so consolidating the configuration there saves some k8s API calls.\n      - type: change\n        title: Tracing was removed.\n        body: >-\n          The ability to collect trace has been removed along with the `telepresence gather-traces` and\n          `telepresence upload-traces` commands.

The most common case when this makes a difference is that statefulsets now are listed when they should.\n  - version: 2.16.0\n    date: \"2023-10-02\"\n    notes:\n      - type: bugfix\n        title: The helm sub-commands will no longer start the user daemon.\n        body: >-\n          The <code>telepresence helm install/upgrade/uninstall</code> commands will no longer start the telepresence\n          user daemon because there's no need to connect to the traffic-manager in order for them to execute.\n      - type: bugfix\n        title: Routing table race condition\n        body: >-\n          A race condition would sometimes occur when a Telepresence TUN device was deleted and another created in rapid\n          succession that caused the routing table to reference interfaces that no longer existed.\n      - type: bugfix\n        title: Stop lingering daemon container\n        body: >-\n          When using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code>, a lingering container could be present, causing errors\n          like &quot;The container name NN is already in use by container XX ...&quot;.

          "content": "# Developing Telepresence 2\n\n## Set up your environment\n\n### Development environment\n\n - `TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY` (required) is the Docker registry that\n   `make push-images` pushes the `tel2` and `telepresence` image to.\n   For most developers, the easiest thing is to set it to\n   `docker.io/USERNAME`.\n\n - `TELEPRESENCE_VERSION` (optional) is the \"vSEMVER\" string to\n   compile-in to the binary and Docker image, if set.  Otherwise,\n   `make` will automatically set this based on the current Git commit\n   and the current time.\n\n - `DTEST_KUBECONFIG` (optional) is the cluster that is used by tests,\n   if set.  Otherwise the tests will automatically use a K3s cluster\n   running locally in Docker.  It is not normally necessary to set\n   this, but it is useful to set it in order to test against different\n   Kubernetes versions/configurations than what\n   https://github.com/datawire/dtest uses.\n\n - `DTEST_REGISTRY` (optional) is the Docker registry that images are\n   pushed to by the tests, if set.  Otherwise, the tests will\n   automatically use a registry running locally in Docker\n   (\"localhost:5000\").  The tests will push images named `tel2` with\n   various version tags.  It is not necessary to set this unless you\n   have set `DTEST_KUBECONFIG`.\n\n   If `DTEST_KUBECONFIG` is pointing to a pre-existing cluster, and you\n   would like the `DTEST_REGISTRY` to point to a private registry that is\n   hosted in that cluster, then you can use `make private-registry`. It\n   will deploy a registry and set it up so that it is reachable at\n   `localhost:5000`, both from the cluster and from the local workstation.\n\n - `DEV_TELEPRESENCE_VERSION` (optional) if set to a version such as\n   `v2.12.1-alpha.0`, the integration tests will assume that this version\n   is pre-built and available, both as a CLI client (accessible from the\n   current runtime path), and also pre-pushed into a pre-existing cluster\n   accessible from `DTEST_KUBECONFIG`. In other words, if this is set, no\n   no binaries will be built or pushed so the development + test cycle\n   can be quit rapid.\n\n - `DEV_CLIENT_IMAGE` (optional) can be set to the fully qualified name of\n   an alternative image to use for the docker image used for the containerized\n   daemon when running in docker mode.\n\n - `DEV_MANAGER_IMAGE` (optional) can be set to the fully qualified name of\n   an alternative image to use for the traffic manager.\n\n - `DEV_AGENT_IMAGE` (optional) can be set to the fully qualified name of\n   an alternative image to use for the traffic agent.\n\n - `DEV_USERD_PROFILING_PORT` and `DEV_ROOTD_PROFILING_PORT` (optional) if\n   set, will cause the `telepresence connect` calls in the integration tests\n   to start daemons where pprof is enabled (see\n   [Profiling the daemons](#profiling_the_daemons) below).\n\nThe above environment can optionally be provided in a `itest.yml` file\nthat is placed adjacent to the normal `config.yml` file used to configure\nTelepresence. The `itest.yml` currently has only one single entry, the\n`Env` which is a map. It can look something like this:\n\n```yaml\nEnv:\n  DEV_TELEPRESENCE_VERSION: v2.12.1-alpha.0\n  DTEST_KUBECONFIG: /home/thhal/.kube/testconfig\n```\n\nThe output of `make help` has a bit more information.\n\n### Running integration tests\n\nIntegration tests can be run using `go test ./integration_test/...`. For\nindividual tests, use the `-m.testify=<pattern>` flag. Verbose output using\nthe `-v` flag is also recommended, because the tests are built with human\nreadable output in mind and timestamps can be compared to timestamps found\nin the telepresence logs.\n\nExample of running one test with existing cluster and registry:\n```\nmake private-registry\nexport DTEST_KUBECONFIG=<your kubeconfig>\nexport DTEST_REGISTRY=localhost:5000\ngo test ./integration_test/... -v -testify.m=Test_InterceptDetailedOutput\n```\n\nThe user running the integration tests needs to be in the docker group.\n\nIf you run these tests on a Mac, localhost won't work. Please use the docker hub, or this value for the registry:\n\n```cli\nexport DTEST_REGISTRY=host.docker.internal:5000\n```\n\nYou must also set this in your docker engine settings: \n\n```json\n{\n   \"insecure-registries\": [\n     \"host.docker.internal:5000\"\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nThe test takes about a minute to complete when using an existing cluster\nand a private registry created by `make private-registry`. During that time\nit:\n- builds the traffic-manager image\n- pushes the image to the registry\n- builds the client binary\n- creates two namespaces for the test\n- performs a helm install of a namespace scoped traffic-manager\n- runs the test\n- uninstalls the traffic-manager\n- deletes the namespaces\n\nThe first two can be omitted (and are omitted when the tests run\nfrom CI) by building the binary using `make build`.\nExample of running test with existing client and traffic-mananager:\n\n```\nmake private-registry\nexport TELEPRESENCE_VERSION=v2.12.1-alpha.0\nexport TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY=localhost:5000\nmake build\nmake push-images\nexport DTEST_KUBECONFIG=<your kubeconfig>\nexport DTEST_REGISTRY=$TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY\nexport DEV_TELEPRESENCE_VERSION=$TELEPRESENCE_VERSION\n\n# Run any number of indivitual test with this setup\ngo test ./integration_test/... -v -testify.m=Test_InterceptDetailedOutput\n```\n\nThe `DEV_TELEPRESENCE_VERSION` tells the integration test that a client and\na traffic-manager of that version has been prebuilt and pushed. This usually\nshortens the time for the test with about 20 seconds.\n\n### Runtime environment\n\n - The main thing is that in your `~/.config/telepresence/config.yml`\n   (`~/Library/Application Support/telepresence/config.yml` on macOS)\n   file you set `images.registry` to match the `TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY`\n   environment variable. See https://www.telepresence.io/docs/reference/config\n   for more information.\n\n - `TELEPRESENCE_VERSION` is is the \"vSEMVER\" string used by the\n   `telepresence` binary *if* one was not compiled in (for example, if\n   you're running it with `go run ./cmd/telepresence` rather than\n   having built it with `make build`).\n\n - `TELEPRESENCE_AGENT_IMAGE` is is the \"name:vSEMVER\" string used when\n   the telepresence auto-installs the traffic-manager unless the config.yml\n   overrides it by defining `images.agentImage`.\n\n - You will need have a `~/.kube/config` file (or set `KUBECONFIG` to\n   point to a different file) file in order to connect to a cluster;\n   same as any other Kubernetes tool.\n\n - You will need to have [mockgen](https://github.com/golang/mock) installed\n   to generate new or updated testing mocks for interfaces.\n\n - You will need to have [argo-rollouts](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts) (including kubectl-argo-rollouts) installed\n   if you interact with functionality that relies on it.\n\n## Build the binary, push the image\n\nThe easiest thing to do to get going:\n\n```console\n$ TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY=docker.io/thhal make build push-images # use .\\build-aux\\winmake.bat build on windows\n[make] TELEPRESENCE_VERSION=v2.12.1-19-g37085c2d7-1655891839\n... # Lots of output\n2.12.1-19-g37085c2d7-1655891839: digest: sha256:40fe852f8d8026a89f196293f37ae8c462c765c85572150d26263d78c43cdd4b size: 1157\n```\n\nThis has 3 primary outputs:\n 1. The `./build-output/bin/telepresence` executable binary\n 2. The `${TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY}/tel2` Docker image\n 3. The `${TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY}/telepresence` Docker image\n\nIt essentially does 4 separate tasks:\n 1. `make build` to build the `./build-output/bin/telepresence`\n    executable binary\n 2. `make tel2-image` to build the `${TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY}/tel2` Docker\n    image.\n 3. `make client-image` to build the `${TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY}/telepresence` Docker\n   image.\n 4. `make push-images` to push the `${TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY}/tel2` and `${TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY}/telepresence`\n    Docker images.\n\nYou can run any of those tasks separately, but be warned: The\n`TELEPRESENCE_VERSION` for all 4 needs to agree, and `make` includes a\ntimestamp in the default `TELEPRESENCE_VERSION`; if you run the tasks\nseparately you will need to explicitly set the `TELEPRESENCE_VERSION`\nenvironment variable so that they all agree.\n\nWhen working on just the command-line binary, it is often useful to\nrun it simply using `go run ./cmd/telepresence` rather than compiling\nit first; but be warned: When run this way it won't know its own\nversion number (`telepresence version` will report \"v0.0.0-devel\")\nunless you set the `TELEPRESENCE_VERSION` environment variable, you\nwill want to set it to the version of a previously-pushed Docker\nimage.\n\nYou may think that the initial suggestion of running `make build\npush-images` all the time (so that every build gets new matching\nversion numbers) would be terribly slow.  However, This is not as slow\nas you might think; both `go` and `docker` are very good about reusing\nexisting builds and avoiding unnecessary work.\n\n## Run the tests\n\nRunning the tests does *not* require having previously built or pushed\nanything.\n\nThe tests make use of `sudo`; it is useful to get in the habit of\nrunning a no-op `sudo` command to pre-emptively prompt for your\npassword to avoid having to notice when the prompt appears in the test\noutput.\n\n```console\n$ sudo id\n[sudo] password for lukeshu:\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\n\n$ make check-unit\n[make] TELEPRESENCE_VERSION=v2.6.7-20-g9de10e316-1655892249\n...\n```\n\nThe first time you run the tests, you should use `make check`, to get\n`make` to automatically create the requisite `heml` tool\nbinaries.  However, after that initial run, you can instead use\n`gotestsum` or `go test` if you prefer.\n\n### Test metric collection\n\n**When running in CI,** `make check-unit` and `make check-integration` this `test-report` tool will\nvisually modify test output; this happens even running locally, since the json output to go test\nis piped to the tool anyway:\n\n```console\n$ make check-unit\n```\n\n## Building for Release\n\nSee https://www.notion.so/datawire/To-Release-Telepresence-2-x-x-2752ef26968444b99d807979cde06f2f\n\n## Updating license documentation\n\nRun `make generate` and commit changes to `DEPENDENCY_LICENSES.md` and `DEPENDENCIES.md`\n\n## Developing on Windows\n\n### Building on Windows\n\nWe do not currently support using `make` directly to build on Windows. Instead, use `build-aux\\winmake.bat` and pass it the same parameters\nyou would pass to make. `winmake.bat` will run `make` from inside a Docker container, with appropriate parameters to build windows binaries.\n\n## Debugging and Troubleshooting\n\n### Log output\n\nThere are two logs:\n - the `connector.log` log file which contains output from the\n   background-daemon parts of Telepresence that run as your regular\n   user: the interaction with the traffic-manager and the cluster\n   (traffic-manager and traffic-agent installs, intercepts, port\n   forwards, etc.), and\n - the `daemon.log` log file which contains output from the parts of\n   telepresence that run as the \"root\" administrator user: the\n   networking changes and services that happen on your workstation.\n\nThe location of both logs is:\n\n - on macOS: `~/Library/Logs/telepresence/`\n - on GNU/Linux: `~/.cache/telepresence/logs/`\n - on Windows `\"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\logs\"`\n\nThe logs are rotating and a new log is created every time Telepresence\ncreates a new connection to the cluster, e.g. on `telepresence\nconnect` after a `telepresence quit` that terminated the last session.\n\n#### Watching the logs\n\nA convenient way to watch rotating logs is to use `tail -F\n<filename>`.  It will automatically and seamlessly follow the\nrotation.\n\n#### Debugging early-initialization errors\n\nIf there's an error from the connector or daemon during early\ninitialization, it might quit before the logfiles are set up.  Perhaps\nthe problem is even with setting up the logfile itself.\n\nYou can run the `connector-foreground` or `daemon-foreground` commands\ndirectly, to see what they spit out on stderr before dying:\n\n```console\n$ telepresence connector-foreground    # or daemon-foreground\n```\n\nIf stdout is a TTY device, they don't set up logfiles and instead log\nto stderr.  In order to debug the logfile setup, simply pipe the\ncommand to `cat` to trigger the usual logfile setup:\n\n```console\n$ telepresence connector-foreground | cat\n```\n\n### Profiling the daemons\n\nThe daemons can be profiled using [pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof).\nThe profiling is initialized using the following flags:\n\n```console\n$ telepresence quit -s\n$ telepresence connect --userd-profiling-port 6060 --rootd-profiling-port 6061\n```\n\nIf a daemon is started with pprof, then the goroutine stacks and much other\ninfo can be found by connecting your browser to http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/\n(swap 6060 for whatever port you used with the flags)\n\n#### Dumping the goroutine stacks\n\nA dump will be produced in the respective logs for the daemon simply by killing it\nwith a SIGQUIT signal. On Windows however, using profiling is the only option.\n\n### RBAC issues\n\nIf you are debugging or working on RBAC-related feature work with\nTelepresence, it can be helpful to have a user with limited RBAC\nprivileges/roles.  There are many ways you can do this, but the way we\ndo it in our tests is like so:\n\n```console\n$ kubectl apply -f k8s/client_rbac.yaml\nserviceaccount/telepresence-test-developer created\nclusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/telepresence-role created\nclusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/telepresence-clusterrolebinding created\n\n$ kubectl get sa telepresence-test-developer -o \"jsonpath={.secrets[0].name}\"\ntelepresence-test-developer-token-<hash>\n\n$ kubectl get secret telepresence-test-developer-token-<hash> -o \"jsonpath={.data.token}\" > b64_token\n$ cat b64_token | base64 --decode\n<plaintext token>\n\n$ kubectl config set-credentials telepresence-test-developer --token <plaintext token>\n```\n\nThis creates a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding\nwhich can be used with kubectl (`kubectl config use-context\ntelepresence-test-developer`) to work in a RBAC-restricted\nenvironment.\n\n### Errors from `make generate`\n\n#### Missing go.sum entries\nIf you get an error like this:\n\n```\ncd tools/src/go-mkopensource && GOOS= GOARCH= go build -o /home/andres/source/production/telepresence/tools/bin/go-mkopensource $(sed -En 's,^import \"(.*)\".*,\\1,p' pin.go)\nmissing go.sum entry for module providing package github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource; to add:\n\tgo mod download github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource\n```\n\nAdd the missing entries by going to the folder that caused the failure (in this case it's\n/home/andres/source/production/telepresence/tools/bin/go-mkopensource) and run the command provided by go:\n\n```\ngo mod download github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource\n```\n"

          "content": "# Telepresence Project Governance\n\nThe goal of the Telepresence project is to accelerate the \"developer inner loop\" for cloud-native application\ndevelopment on Kubernetes.\n\nTelepresence achieves this by creating a dynamic network bridge between a local development environment (e.g., a laptop)\nand a remote Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThis governance explains how the project is run.\n\n- [Values](#values)\n- [Maintainers](#maintainers)\n- [Becoming a Maintainer](#becoming-a-maintainer)\n- [Meetings](#meetings)\n- [CNCF Resources](#cncf-resources)\n- [Code of Conduct Enforcement](#code-of-conduct)\n- [Security Response Team](#security-response-team)\n- [Voting](#voting)\n- [Modifications](#modifying-this-charter)\n\n## Values\n\nThe Telepresence project and its leadership embrace the following values:\n\n* Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future\n  reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public\n  forums and open repositories.\n\n* Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit\n  contributions, which will be considered on their merits.\n\n* Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes\n  priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals.  Each\n  contributor participates in the project as an individual.\n\n* Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which\n  can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.\n\n* Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through\n  participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership\n  positions.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nTelepresence Maintainers have write access to the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence).\nThey can merge their own patches or patches from others. The current maintainers\ncan be found in [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md).  Maintainers collectively manage the project's\nresources and contributors.\n\nThis privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers\nare people who care about the Telepresence project and want to help it grow and\nimprove. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who\nhas demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most\nknowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and\nfollow through to fix issues (in code or tests).\n\nA maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping\nthe project succeed.\n\nThe collective team of all Maintainers is known as the Maintainer Council, which\nis the governing body for the project.\n\n### Maintainer responsibilities\n\n* Monitor email aliases.\n* Monitor Slack (delayed response is perfectly acceptable).\n* Triage GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other maintainers and the community.\n* Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them.\n* In general continue to be willing to spend at least 20% of one's time working on Telepresence (~1 business day/week).\n\n### Becoming a Maintainer\n\n* Express interest to the current maintainers (see [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)) that your organization is\ninterested in becoming a maintainer. Becoming a maintainer generally means that you are going to be spending\nsubstantial time on Telepresence for the foreseeable future.\n* We will expect you to start contributing increasingly complicated PRs, under the guidance of the existing maintainers.\n* We may ask you to do some PRs from our backlog.\n* As you gain experience with the code base and our standards, we will ask you to do code reviews for incoming PRs.\nAll maintainers are expected to shoulder a proportional share of community reviews.\n* After a period of approximately 2-3 months of working together and making sure we see eye to eye, the existing\nmaintainers will confer and decide whether to grant maintainer status or not.\nWe make no guarantees on the length of time this will take, but 2-3 months is the goal.\n\nA new Maintainer can apply by sending a message in our [OSS Slack workspace](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cloud-native/cncf),\nin the [#telepresence-oss](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C06B36KJ85P) channel.\n\nA simple majority vote of existing Maintainers approves the application.\n\nMaintainers nominations will be evaluated without prejudice\nto employer or demographics.\n\nMaintainers who are selected will be granted the necessary GitHub rights.\n\n### Removing a Maintainer\n\nMaintainers may resign at any time if they feel that they will not be able to\ncontinue fulfilling their project duties.\n\nMaintainers may also be removed after being inactive, failure to fulfill their\nMaintainer responsibilities, violating the Code of Conduct, or other reasons.\nInactivity is defined as a period of very low or no activity in the project\nfor a year or more, with no definite schedule to return to full Maintainer\nactivity.\n\nA Maintainer may be removed at any time by a 2/3 vote of the remaining maintainers.\n\nDepending on the reason for removal, a Maintainer may be converted to Emeritus\nstatus. Emeritus Maintainers will still be consulted on some project matters,\nand can be rapidly returned to Maintainer status if their availability changes.\n\n## Meetings\n\nTime zones permitting, Maintainers are expected to participate in the public\ndeveloper meeting.\n\nDetails can be found [here](./MEETING_SCHEDULE.md#monthly-contributors-meeting).\n\nMaintainers will also have closed meetings in order to discuss security reports\nor Code of Conduct violations.  Such meetings should be scheduled by any\nMaintainer on receipt of a security issue or CoC report.  All current Maintainers\nmust be invited to such closed meetings, except for any Maintainer who is\naccused of a CoC violation.\n\n## CNCF Resources\n\nAny Maintainer may suggest a request for CNCF resources, either in the\n[#telepresence-dev](https://datawire-oss.slack.com/archives/CC5D1UTTN) in slack, or during a\nmeeting.  A simple majority of Maintainers approves the request.  The Maintainers\nmay also choose to delegate working with the CNCF to non-Maintainer community\nmembers, who will then be added to the [CNCF's Maintainer List](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv)\nfor that purpose.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n[Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md)\nviolations by community members will be discussed and resolved\non the [private slack channel](https://datawire-oss.slack.com/archives/C061Q45SU4F).  If a Maintainer is directly involved\nin the report, the Maintainers will instead designate two Maintainers to work\nwith the CNCF Code of Conduct Committee in resolving it.\n\n## Security Response Team\n\nThe Maintainers will appoint a Security Response Team to handle security reports.\nThis committee may simply consist of the Maintainer Council themselves.  If this\nresponsibility is delegated, the Maintainers will appoint a team of at least two\ncontributors to handle it.  The Maintainers will review who is assigned to this\nat least once a year.\n\nThe Security Response Team is responsible for handling all reports of security\nholes and breaches according to the [security policy](./SECURITY.md).\n\n## Voting\n\nIn general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out between the persons\ninvolved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the maintainers can be called in to decide an issue. If the\nmaintainers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will be resolved by voting.\nThe voting process is a simple majority in which each maintainer receives one vote.\n\nA vote can be taken on [#telepresence-dev](https://datawire-oss.slack.com/archives/CC5D1UTTN) or\n[#telepresence-dev-private](https://datawire-oss.slack.com/archives/C061Q45SU4F) for security or conduct matters.\n\nAny Maintainer may demand a vote be taken.\n\nMost votes require a simple majority of all Maintainers to succeed, except where\notherwise noted.  Two-thirds majority votes mean at least two-thirds of all\nexisting maintainers.\n\n## Modifying this Charter\n\nChanges to this Governance and its supporting documents may be approved by\na 2/3 vote of the Maintainers.\n\n## Adding new projects to the Telepresence GitHub organization\n\nNew projects will be added to the Telepresence organization via GitHub issue discussion in one of the existing projects\nin the organization. Once sufficient discussion has taken place (~3-5 business days but depending on the volume\nof conversation), the maintainers of *the project where the issue was opened* (since different projects in the\norganization may have different maintainers) will decide whether the new project should be added. See the section\nabove on voting if the maintainers cannot easily decide.\n"

By default, it will reside in the `ambassador` namespace:\n```console\n$ telepresence helm install\n\nTraffic Manager installed successfully\n```\n\n### Establish a connection to  the cluster (outbound traffic)\n\nLet telepresence connect:\n```console\n$ telepresence connect\nLaunching Telepresence Root Daemon\nLaunching Telepresence User Daemon\nConnected to context default, namespace default (https://35.232.104.64)\n```\n\nA session is now active and outbound connections will be routed to the cluster. I.e. your laptop is logically \"inside\"\na namespace in the cluster.\n\nSince telepresence connected to the default namespace, all services in that namespace can now be reached directly\nby their name. You can of course also use namespaced names, e.g. `curl hello.default`.\n\n```console\n$ curl hello\nCLIENT VALUES:\nclient_address=10.244.0.87\ncommand=GET\nreal path=/\nquery=nil\nrequest_version=1.1\nrequest_uri=http://hello:8080/\n\nSERVER VALUES:\nserver_version=nginx: 1.10.0 - lua: 10001\n\nHEADERS RECEIVED:\naccept=*/*\nhost=hello\nuser-agent=curl/8.0.1\nBODY:\n-no body in request-\n```\n\n### Intercept the service. I.e. redirect traffic to it to our laptop (inbound traffic)\n\nAdd an intercept for the hello deployment on port 9000. Here, we also start a service listening on that port:\n\n```console\n$ telepresence intercept hello --port 9000 -- python3 -m http.server 9000\nUsing Deployment hello\nintercepted\n    Intercept name         : hello\n    State                  : ACTIVE\n    Workload kind          : Deployment\n    Destination            : 127.0.0.1:9000\n    Service Port Identifier: 80\n    Volume Mount Point     : /tmp/telfs-524630891\n    Intercepting           : all TCP connections\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 9000 (http://0.0.0.0:9000/) ...\n```\n\nThe `python -m httpserver` is now started on port 9000 and will run until terminated by `<ctrl>-C`. Access it from a browser using `http://hello/` or use curl from another terminal. With curl, it presents a html listing from the directory where the server was started. Something like:\n```console\n$ curl hello\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\">\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n<title>Directory listing for /</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Directory listing for /</h1>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"file1.txt\">file1.txt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"file2.txt\">file2.txt</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nObserve that the python service reports that it's being accessed:\n```\n127.0.0.1 - - [16/Jun/2022 11:39:20] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n```\n\n### Clean-up and close daemon processes\n\nEnd the service with `<ctrl>-C` and then try `curl hello` or `http://hello` again. The intercept is gone, and the echo service responds as normal.\n\nNow end the session too. Your desktop no longer has access to the cluster internals.\n```console\n$ telepresence quit\nDisconnected\n$ curl hello\ncurl: (6) Could not resolve host: hello\n```\n\nThe telepresence daemons are still running in the background, which is harmless. You'll need to stop them before you\nupgrade telepresence. That's done by passing the option `-s` (stop all local telepresence daemons) to the\nquit command.\n\n```console\n$ telepresence quit -s\nTelepresence Daemons quitting...done\n```\n\n### What got installed in the cluster?\n\nTelepresence installs the Traffic Manager in your cluster if it is not already present. This deployment remains unless you uninstall it.\n\nTelepresence injects the Traffic Agent as an additional container into the pods of the workload you intercept, and  will optionally install\nan init-container to route traffic through the agent (the init-container is only injected when the service is headless or uses a numerical\n`targetPort`). The modifications persist unless you uninstall them.\n\nAt first glance, we can see that the deployment is installed ...\n```console\n$ kubectl get svc,deploy,pod\nservice/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.43.0.1       <none>        443/TCP                      7d22h\nservice/hello        ClusterIP   10.43.145.57    <none>        80/TCP                       13m\n\nNAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/hello   1/1     1            1           13m\n\nNAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE\npod/hello-774455b6f5-6x6vs   2/2     Running   0               10m\n```\n\n... and that the traffic-manager is installed in the \"ambassador\" namespace.\n\n```console\n$ kubectl -n ambassador get svc,deploy,pod\nNAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\nservice/traffic-manager   ClusterIP   None           <none>        8081/TCP   17m\nservice/agent-injector    ClusterIP   10.43.72.154   <none>        443/TCP    17m\n\nNAME                              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\ndeployment.apps/traffic-manager   1/1     1            1           17m\n\nNAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/traffic-manager-dcd4cc64f-6v5bp   1/1     Running   0          17m\n```\n\nThe traffic-agent is installed too, in the hello pod. Here together with an init-container, because the service is using a numerical\n`targetPort`.\n\n```console\n$ kubectl describe pod hello-774455b6f5-6x6vs\nName:

traffic-agent from specific deployments or from all deployments. Or you can choose to uninstall everything in which\ncase the traffic-manager and all traffic-agents will be uninstalled.\n\n```console\n$ telepresence helm uninstall\n```\nwill remove everything that was automatically installed by telepresence from the cluster.\n\n```console\n$ telepresence uninstall hello\n```\nwill remove the traffic-agent and the configmap entry.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nThe telepresence background processes `daemon` and `connector` both produces log files that can be very helpful when problems are\nencountered. The files are named `daemon.log` and `connector.log`. The location of the logs differ depending on what platform that is used:\n\n- macOS `~/Library/Logs/telepresence`\n- Linux `~/.cache/telepresence/logs`\n- Windows `\"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\logs\"`\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen Telepresence 2 connects to a Kubernetes cluster, it\n\n 1. Ensures Traffic Manager is installed in the cluster.\n 2. Looks for the relevant subnets in the kubernetes cluster.\n 3. Creates a Virtual Network Interface (VIF).\n 4. Assigns the cluster's subnets to the VIF.\n 5. Binds itself to VIF and starts routing traffic to the traffic-manager, or a traffic-agent if one is present.\n 6. Starts listening for, and serving DNS requests, by passing a selected portion to the traffic-manager or traffic-agent.\n\nWhen a locally running application makes a network request to a service in the cluster, Telepresence will resolve the name to an address within the cluster.\nThe operating system then sees that the TUN device has an address in the same subnet as the address of the outgoing packets and sends them to `tel0`.\nTelepresence is on the other side of `tel0` and picks up the packets, injecting them into the cluster through a gRPC connection with Traffic Manager.\n\nFor a more in-depth overview, checkout our blog post: [Implementing Telepresence Networking with a TUN device](https://blog.getambassador.io/implementing-telepresence-networking-with-a-tun-device-a23a786d51e9)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nVisit the troubleshooting section in the Telepresence documentation for more advice:\n[Troubleshooting](https://telepresence.io/docs/troubleshooting/)\n\nOr discuss with the community in the [CNCF Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cloud-native/cncf) in the [#telepresence-oss](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C06B36KJ85P) channel.\n\n\n"
