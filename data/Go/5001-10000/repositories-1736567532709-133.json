          "content": "# Contribution Guide\n\nWe welcome and encourage community contributions to Flynn.\n\nPlease familiarize yourself with the Contribution Guidelines and Project Roadmap before contributing.\n\nThere are many ways to help Flynn besides contributing code:\n\n - Fix bugs or file issues\n - Improve the [documentation](https://github.com/flynn/flynn.io)\n\n## Contributing Code\n\nUnless you are fixing a known bug, we **strongly** recommend discussing it with the core team via a GitHub issue, [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/flynn), or [email](mailto:contact@flynn.io) before getting started to ensure your work is consistent with Flynn's roadmap and architecture.\n\nAll contributions are made via pull request. Note that **all patches from all contributors get reviewed**. After a pull request is made other contributors will offer feedback, and if the patch passes review a maintainer will accept it with a comment. When pull requests fail testing, authors are expected to update their pull requests to address the failures until the tests pass and the pull request merges successfully.\n\nAt least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches (even patches from maintainers).\n\nReviewers should leave a \"LGTM\" comment once they are satisfied with the patch. If the patch was submitted by a maintainer with write access, the pull request should be merged by the submitter after review.\n\n## Code Style\n\nPlease follow these guidelines when formatting source code:\n\n* Go code should match the output of `gofmt -s`\n* Shell scripts should adhere to the [Google Shell Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml)\n\n## Developer’s Certificate of Origin\n\nAll contributions must include acceptance of the DCO:\n\n```text\nDeveloper Certificate of Origin\nVersion 1.1\n\nCopyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.\n660 York Street, Suite 102,\nSan Francisco, CA 94110 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nDeveloper's Certificate of Origin 1.1\n\nBy making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n\n(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I\n    have the right to submit it under the open source license\n    indicated in the file; or\n\n(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best\n    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source\n    license and I have the right under that license to submit that\n    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part\n    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am\n    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated\n    in the file; or\n\n(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other\n    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified\n    it.\n\n(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution\n    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all\n    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is\n    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with\n    this project or the open source license(s) involved.\n```\n\nTo accept the DCO, simply add this line to each commit message with your name and email address (`git commit -s` will do this for you):\n\n```text\nSigned-off-by: Jane Example <jane@example.com>\n```\n\nFor legal reasons, no anonymous or pseudonymous contributions are accepted ([contact us](mailto:contact@flynn.io) if this is an issue).\n\n## Pull request procedure\n\nTo make a pull request, you will need a GitHub account; if you are unclear on this process, see GitHub's documentation on [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Pull requests should be targeted at the `master` branch. Before creating a pull request, go through this checklist:\n\n1. Create a feature branch off of `master` so that changes do not get mixed up.\n1. [Rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your local changes against the `master` branch.\n1. Run the full project test suite with the `go test ./...` (or equivalent) command and confirm that it passes.\n1. Run `gofmt -s` (if the project is written in Go).\n1. Accept the Developer's Certificate of Origin on all commits (see above).\n1. Ensure that each commit has a subsystem prefix (ex: `controller: `).\n\nPull requests will be treated as \"review requests,\" and maintainers will give feedback on the style and substance of the patch.\n\nNormally, all pull requests must include tests that test your change. Occasionally, a change will be very difficult to test for. In those cases, please include a note in your commit message explaining why.\n\n## Communication\n\nWe use the #flynn IRC channel on [Freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net/flynn). You are welcome to drop in and ask questions, discuss bugs, etc. It is [logged on BotBot.me](https://botbot.me/freenode/flynn/) and you can [connect using webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=flynn) if you do not have an IRC client.\n\n## Conduct\n\nWhether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.\n\n* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.\n* Please avoid using nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.\n* Be kind and courteous. There is no need to be mean or rude.\n* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. In particular, we do not tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.\n* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or a member of the Flynn core team immediately.\n* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.\n\nWe welcome discussion about creating a welcoming, safe, and productive environment for the community. If you have any questions, feedback, or concerns [please let us know](mailto:contact@flynn.io).\n"

          "content": "# Prime Directive Privacy Policy\n\n_May 18, 2017_\n\nYour privacy is an important factor that Prime Directive (that's us) considers in the\ndevelopment of each of our products and services. We are committed to being\ntransparent and open. This Prime Directive Privacy Policy explains generally how we\nreceive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have\nit.\n\n## What do we mean by \"personal information?\"\n\nFor us, \"personal information\" means information which identifies you, like your\nname or email address.\n\nAny information that falls outside of this is \"non-personal information.\"\n\nIf we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we\nwill consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal\ninformation from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.\n\n## How do we learn information about you?\n\nWe learn information about you when:\n\n- you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports);\n- we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., when your\n  Flynn cluster or Flynn CLI sends us usage statistics);\n- someone else tells us information about you (e.g., when Flynn works with your\n  cloud provider to set up your account); or\n- when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to\n  us (e.g., when we use your IP address and operating system to direct you to\n  a CLI download).\n\n## What do we do with your information once we have it?\n\nWhen you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given\nus permission. Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve\nour products and services for you.\n\n## When do we share your information with others?\n\n- When we have asked and received your permission to share it.\n- For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those\n  entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the\n  data in ways that are approved by Prime Directive.\n- When we release information to make our products better and foster an open\n  community, but when we do so, we will remove your personal information and try\n  to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.\n- When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about\n  you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're\n  asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally\n  prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we'll only\n  release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law\n  requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal\n  defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to\n  disclose your information.\n- When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. We\n  will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief\n  that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of\n  you, our other users, Prime Directive or the public.\n- If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo\n  a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to\n  a successor or affiliate.\n\n## How do we store and protect your personal information?\n\nWe are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We\nimplement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our\nefforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take\nappropriate protective steps.\n\nWe also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so\nwe only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't need\nit, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.\n\n## What else should you know?\n\nWe're a global organization and our computers are in several different places\naround the world. We also use service providers whose computers may also be in\nvarious countries. This means that your information might end up on one of those\ncomputers in another country, and that country may have a different level of\ndata protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to\nthis kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country your\ninformation is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the\ncommitments we make in this privacy policy.\n\nIf you are under 13, we don't want your personal information, and you must not\nprovide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your child who is under\n13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us to have your\nchild's information removed.\n\n## What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?\n\nWe may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted\nonline. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through\nPrime Directive's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and emails.\nYour continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such\nchanges constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more\nconvenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.\n\n## Twitter Analytics\n\nSome of our websites use Twitter Analytics to collect user data for the purposes\nof conversion tracking and serving ads targeted to users’ interests. You can\navoid the collection of your data for this purpose and opt out by using one of\nthe methods [specified by\nTwitter](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405).\n\n## Usage Statistics\n\nFlynn sends Prime Directive usage, performance, and configuration statistics.\nYour IP address and randomly generated identifiers are also collected. These\nstatistics are transmitted using TLS and help us improve future versions of\nFlynn. Once sent to Prime Directive, statistics may be aggregated and made\navailable to a broad range of developers, including both Prime Directive\nemployees and public contributors.\n\nCollection of statistics may be disabled for a Flynn cluster by running this\ncommand:\n\n```text\nflynn -a controller env set TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true\n```\n\n## Contact Prime Directive\n\nIf you want to make a correction to your information, or you have any questions\nabout our privacy policies, please get in touch with:\n\nPrime Directive, Inc.<br>\nAttn: Legal Notices - Privacy<br>\n503 Paisley Place<br>\nNewark, DE 19711\n\n_This document is adapted from the [Mozilla Privacy\nPolicy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/) and licensed under the [Creative\nCommons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0 Unported\nlicense](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en), or any later\nversion._\n"
