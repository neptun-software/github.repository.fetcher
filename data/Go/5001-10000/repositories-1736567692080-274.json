Bit must be fully compatible with Git\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThanks to [Gitless](https://gitless.com/), [git-extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras), researchers in the field and of course the developers of `git` itself! Also, thanks to [go-prompt](https://github.com/c-bata/go-prompt) for the interactive prompt library\n\n## News \n- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24751212\n- https://www.tldrnewsletter.com/archives/20201007\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/j5wggn/bit_an_experimental_git_cli_with_a_powerful/\n- https://b.hatena.ne.jp/entry/s/github.com/chriswalz/bit\n- https://news.hada.io/topic?id=2990\n- https://twitter.com/newsycombinator/status/1315517850954727424\n- https://forum.devtalk.com/t/bit-a-modernized-git-cli-written-in-go/3065\n- https://gocn.vip/topics/11063\n- https://golangweekly.com/issues/333\n- https://archive.faabli.com/archive/2020-10-09 \n- https://www.wykop.pl/wpis/52945683/unknownews-wolanie-nie-dziala-zapisz-sie-lepiej-na/\n- https://blog.csdn.net/a419240016/article/details/109178001\n\n## Changelog\nv1.1.2\n- [X] enhancement: add `bit sw` as alias for `bit switch`\n- [X] fix: bit save will amend commits only when the commit doesn't exist in any other branch\nv1.1\n- [X] enhancement: enable interactive prompt (keep bit running) with env variable: BIT_INTERACTIVE=true\n\nv1.0\n- [X] enhancement: significantly more autocompletions\n- [X] enhancement: use fuzzy search for branch suggestions\n- [X] refactor: completions now represented in tree data structure\n- [X] fix: bit save no longer shows debug error outside debug mode\n- [X] fix: use --is-inside-work-tree to determine whether inside a git repo\n- [X] fix: gracefully handle bad release tags for `bit release bump`\n- [X] fix: bit pr not listing PR in some cases\n- [X] security: fix vuln on Windows where an exe in a malicious repository could run arbitrary code. Special thanks to RyotaK - https://github.com/Ry0taK for identifying this issue\n\nv0.9\n- [X] enhancement: improve bit sync behavior including `bit sync <upstream> <branch>`\n- [X] enhancement: bit sync provides a rebase option for diverged branches`\n- [X] fix: enable compatibility with non-english languages \n- [X] enhancement: `bit merge` suggestions\n\nv0.8\n- [X] feature: checkout Pull Requests from github (requires `gh pr list` to work)\n- [X] enhancement: install with homebrew: `brew install bit-git`\n- [X] enhancement: Color themes `BIT_THEME=inverted` or `BIT_THEME=monochrome` light terminal backgrounds\n- [X] fix: bit clone outside a git repo\n- [X] enhancement: bit is now a single binary\n\nv0.7\n- [X] feature: update your cli with `bit update`\n\nv0.6\n- [X] fix: improved git compatibility for older versions of git \n- [X] feature: emacs key binds \n- [X] feature: relative and absolute branch times\n- [X] feature: completions for rebase & log\n- [X] enhancement: smarter suggestions\n- [X] fix: show proper descriptions for some flags\n- [X] fix: prevent panic on classical tab completion for some users\n\nv0.5\n\n- [X] `bit switch`, `bit co`, `bit checkout` will show prompt \n- [X] fix bit tab completion (bitcomplete)\n- [X] fix edge case where there is an invalid ref\n- [X] various minor fixes\n- [X] more completions\n- [X] better suggestion filtering\n- [X] absolute and relative times for branch suggestions\n\nv0.4\n\n- [X] multiline support with Go Survey Library\n- [X] color mitigation to have roughly similar colors across OSs \n- [X] fix README go get installation instructions\n- [X] QOL improvements for `bit sync`\n\n## How to uninstall\n*go binaries are self-contained so uninstalling simply requires deleting the binary(ies)*\n\n```\nrm `which bit`\n```\n\nIf you ran `bit complete` optionally remove a line from your `bash_profile`, `.zshrc` etc.\n\n`complete -o nospace -C /Users/{_USER_}/go/bin/bit bit`\n\n## How to install\n\n### using `cURL` (Simplest way to install)\n\nLike bit? [Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/chriswalz) bit for $5\n\n```shell script\ncurl -sf https://gobinaries.com/chriswalz/bit | sh;\nbit complete;\necho \"Type bit then press <ENTER> to show interactive prompt\"\nbit;\n```\n\nTo overwrite installation location\n\n`export PREFIX=/opt/bit/git && mkdir -p ${PREFIX}  ## optional: override default install location /usr/local/bin`\n\n\n`bit`, `bit checkout` & `bit switch` will show interactive prompts after you press ENTER\n\n### using `go`\n*Caveats: GOPATH and GOBIN need to be set. Verify with `go env`. If they are not set, add this to your .bashrc or .bash_profile etc. AND open new terminal*\n```shell script\nexport GOPATH=$HOME/go\nexport GOBIN=$(go env GOPATH)/bin\n```\n\n```shell script\ngo install github.com/chriswalz/bit@latest;\nbit complete\n```\n\n### using `Homebrew` (For MacOS users)\n\n```shell script\nbrew install bit-git\nbit complete\nbit\n```\n\nNot working? Try `brew doctor`\n\n### using `MacPorts` (For MacOS users)\n\n```shell script\nsudo port selfupdate\nsudo port install bit\n```\n\n\n#### using `go` (For Windows Users)\n```shell script\ngo env -w GO111MODULE=on\n\n# if latest is not working, replace it with the latest tag found here https://github.com/chriswalz/bit/releases\ngo get github.com/chriswalz/bit@latest; \nbit\n```\n\n#### using `Chocolatey` (For Windows Users)\n```shell script\nchoco install bit-git\n```\n\n#### using `zinit`\n```shell script\nzinit ice lucit wait\"0\" as\"program\" from\"gh-r\" pick\"bit\"\nzinit light \"chriswalz/bit\"\n```\n\n*Note*: On Windows only the interactive prompt completion works not classic tab completion\n\n#### using AUR (For Arch Linux Users)\nFor building a stable version from source, use the [`bit` package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bit)\n\nFor building the latest git version from source, use the [`bit-git` package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bit-git)\n\n*Note*: These Packages are community-driven and not offically published my the bit maintainer.\n\nVerify installation with:\n\n`bit`\n\nDependencies: Git\n\nPlatform Support:\n- iTerm2 (macOS)\n- Terminal.app (macOS)\n- Command Prompt (Windows)\n- WSL/Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows)\n- gnome-terminal (Ubuntu)\n"
