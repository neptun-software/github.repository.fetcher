Supports [POSIX Shell], [Bash], and\n[mksh]. Requires Go 1.22 or later.\n\n### Quick start\n\nTo parse shell scripts, inspect them, and print them out, see the [syntax\nexamples](https://pkg.go.dev/mvdan.cc/sh/v3/syntax#pkg-examples).\n\nFor high-level operations like performing shell expansions on strings, see the\n[shell examples](https://pkg.go.dev/mvdan.cc/sh/v3/shell#pkg-examples).\n\n### shfmt\n\n\tgo install mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt@latest\n\n`shfmt` formats shell programs. See [canonical.sh](syntax/canonical.sh) for a\nquick look at its default style. For example:\n\n\tshfmt -l -w script.sh\n\nFor more information, see [its manpage](cmd/shfmt/shfmt.1.scd), which can be\nviewed directly as Markdown or rendered with [scdoc].\n\nPackages are available on [Alpine], [Arch], [Debian], [Docker], [Fedora], [FreeBSD],\n[Homebrew], [MacPorts], [NixOS], [OpenSUSE], [Scoop], [Snapcraft], [Void] and [webi].\n\n### gosh\n\n\tgo install mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/gosh@latest\n\nProof of concept shell that uses `interp`. Note that it's not meant to replace a\nPOSIX shell at the moment, and its options are intentionally minimalistic.\n\n### Fuzzing\n\nWe use Go's native fuzzing support. For instance:\n\n\tcd syntax\n\tgo test -run=- -fuzz=ParsePrint\n\n### Caveats\n\n* When indexing Bash associative arrays, always use quotes. The static parser\n  will otherwise have to assume that the index is an arithmetic expression.\n\n```sh\n$ echo '${array[spaced string]}' | shfmt\n1:16: not a valid arithmetic operator: string\n$ echo '${array[dash-string]}' | shfmt\n${array[dash - string]}\n```\n\n* `$((` and `((` ambiguity is not supported. Backtracking would complicate the\n  parser and make streaming support via `io.Reader` impossible. The POSIX spec\n  recommends to [space the operands][posix-ambiguity] if `$( (` is meant.\n\n```sh\n$ echo '$((foo); (bar))' | shfmt\n1:1: reached ) without matching $(( with ))\n```\n\n* `export`, `let`, and `declare` are parsed as keywords.\n  This allows statically building their syntax tree,\n  as opposed to keeping the arguments as a slice of words.\n  It is also required to support `declare foo=(bar)`.\n  Note that this means expansions like `declare {a,b}=c` are not supported.\n\n### JavaScript\n\nA subset of the Go packages are available as an npm package called [mvdan-sh].\nSee the [_js](_js) directory for more information.\n\n### Docker\n\nAll release tags are published via [Docker], such as `v3.5.1`.\nThe latest stable release is currently published as `v3`,\nand the latest development version as `latest`.\nThe images only include `shfmt`; `-alpine` variants exist on Alpine Linux.\n\nTo build a Docker image, run:\n\n\tdocker build -t my:tag -f cmd/shfmt/Dockerfile .\n\nTo use a Docker image, run:\n\n\tdocker run --rm -u \"$(id -u):$(id -g)\" -v \"$PWD:/mnt\" -w /mnt my:tag <shfmt arguments>\n\n### Related projects\n\nThe following editor integrations wrap `shfmt`:\n\n- [BashSupport-Pro] - Bash plugin for JetBrains IDEs\n- [intellij-shellcript] - Intellij Jetbrains `shell script` plugin\n- [micro] - Editor with a built-in plugin\n- [shell-format] - VS Code plugin\n- [vscode-shfmt] - VS Code plugin\n- [shfmt.el] - Emacs package\n- [Sublime-Pretty-Shell] - Sublime Text 3 plugin\n- [Trunk] - Universal linter, available as a CLI, VS Code plugin, and GitHub action\n- [vim-shfmt] - Vim plugin\n\nOther noteworthy integrations include:\n\n- [modd] - A developer tool that responds to filesystem changes\n- [prettier-plugin-sh] - [Prettier] plugin using [mvdan-sh]\n- [sh-checker] - A GitHub Action that performs static analysis for shell scripts\n- [mdformat-shfmt] - [mdformat] plugin to format shell scripts embedded in Markdown with shfmt\n- [pre-commit-shfmt] - [pre-commit] shfmt hook\n\n[alpine]: https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=shfmt\n[arch]: https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/shfmt/\n[bash]: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/\n[BashSupport-Pro]: https://www.bashsupport.com/manual/editor/formatter/\n[debian]: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/golang-mvdan-sh\n[docker]: https://hub.docker.com/r/mvdan/shfmt/\n[editorconfig]: https://editorconfig.org/\n[examples]: https://pkg.go.dev/mvdan.cc/sh/v3/syntax#pkg-examples\n[fedora]: https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/golang-mvdan-sh-3/shfmt/\n[freebsd]: https://www.freshports.org/devel/shfmt\n[homebrew]: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/shfmt\n[intellij-shellcript]: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/shell-scripts.html\n[macports]: https://ports.macports.org/port/shfmt/details/\n[mdformat-shfmt]: https://github.com/hukkin/mdformat-shfmt\n[mdformat]: https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat\n[micro]: https://micro-editor.github.io/\n[mksh]: http://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm\n[modd]: https://github.com/cortesi/modd\n[mvdan-sh]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mvdan-sh\n[nixos]: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/HEAD/pkgs/tools/text/shfmt/default.nix\n[OpenSUSE]: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/shfmt\n[posix shell]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html\n[posix-ambiguity]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_03\n[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com\n[pre-commit-shfmt]: https://github.com/scop/pre-commit-shfmt\n[prettier-plugin-sh]: https://github.com/un-ts/prettier/tree/master/packages/sh\n[prettier]: https://prettier.io\n[scdoc]: https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc/\n[scoop]: https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main/blob/HEAD/bucket/shfmt.json\n[sh-checker]: https://github.com/luizm/action-sh-checker\n[shell-format]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foxundermoon.shell-format\n[shfmt.el]: https://github.com/purcell/emacs-shfmt/\n[snapcraft]: https://snapcraft.io/shfmt\n[sublime-pretty-shell]: https://github.com/aerobounce/Sublime-Pretty-Shell\n[trunk]: https://trunk.io/check\n[vim-shfmt]: https://github.com/z0mbix/vim-shfmt\n[void]: https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/HEAD/srcpkgs/shfmt/template\n[vscode-shfmt]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.shfmt\n[webi]: https://webinstall.dev/shfmt/\n"
