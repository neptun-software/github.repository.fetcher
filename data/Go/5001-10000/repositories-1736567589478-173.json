          "content": "# Commercial License for Yao\n\nThis document outlines the terms for the commercial license of the **Yao** project. While the Yao project is primarily licensed under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**, certain commercial use cases require a separate commercial license.\n\n## 1. Commercial License Requirements\n\nThe following use cases require a commercial license:\n\n1. **Application Hosting Services**  \n   If you use Yao, or any derivative product (such as a forked or modified version of Yao), to provide Yao-based application hosting services (e.g., Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)) to users, you must obtain a commercial license. This restriction applies regardless of whether the original Yao code or a modified version is used to host and manage applications on behalf of third-party users for commercial purposes.  \n   **In addition**, if you provide hosting services for applications that are built using Yao (even if they are customized or modified versions of Yao), a commercial license is required.\n\n   ### Definition: Application Hosting Services\n\n   \"Application Hosting Services\" refers to any service that involves hosting Yao-based applications or web applications created with Yao (including modified versions of Yao) for third-party users. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n   - **Hosting platforms** providing software or services built on top of Yao for third-party users.\n   - **SaaS or PaaS offerings** where you manage and host applications that are based on or utilize Yao, either in their original or modified form.\n   - **Managed hosting services** where Yao is used as the underlying technology for applications deployed for external clients.\n\n   In these cases, a commercial license is required, whether you are using the original Yao code or a fork/modified version.\n\n2. **AI Web Application Generation Services**  \n   If you provide services that generate AI-driven web applications using Yao, or any derivative product (such as a fork or modified version of Yao), to third-party users, you are required to purchase a commercial license.\n\n   ### Definition: AI Web Application Generation Services\n\n   \"AI Web Application Generation Services\" refers to any service or functionality that utilizes Yao (or any forked or modified version of Yao) to automate the creation of web applications with AI capabilities. This includes, but is not limited to, providing third-party users with:\n\n   - **Automated web application development** driven by AI, where the service generates complete or partial web applications.\n   - **Customizable web solutions** that are powered by AI and built using Yao as the core technology.\n   - **On-demand application generation** for specific client needs, using Yao to dynamically build, configure, or deploy applications for users.\n\n   In these cases, whether Yao is directly used, forked, or modified, a commercial license is required to operate legally.\n\n## 2. Use Under Apache License 2.0\n\nFor all other uses, the **Apache License, Version 2.0** applies. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the Yao project under the terms of Apache 2.0 as long as your usage does not fall within the restricted scenarios outlined above.\n\n## 3. Obtaining a Commercial License\n\nTo inquire about or obtain a commercial license, please contact us at:\n\n- **Email**: [friends@iqka.com]\n- **Website**: [https://moapi.ai/contact]\n\nPricing and terms for commercial licenses vary based on usage scenarios, user scale, and other factors.\n\n## 4. Compliance and Auditing\n\nIf you have any questions about whether your use case requires a commercial license, please contact us for clarification. We reserve the right to audit usage for compliance and enforce commercial licensing terms where necessary.\n\n## 5. Disclaimer\n\nFailure to comply with these licensing terms may result in a violation of the Yao licensing agreement and could lead to legal action.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This commercial license is supplementary to the Apache 2.0 license and only applies in specific commercial scenarios outlined above.\n"

          "content": "## What is Yao?\n\nYao is an all-in-one application engine that enables developers to create web apps, REST APIs, business applications, and more, with AI as a development partner.\n\nYao lets you create apps using AI, a visual interface, or by writing them yourself. Its DSL (Domain-Specific Language) is easy to read and write, and it works well with AI. With full programming capabilities and a single command-line tool to handle everything, you can switch smoothly between manual coding and AI assistance, making web app development fast and flexible.\n\n**Quick Links:**\n\n**🏠 Homepage:** [https://yaoapps.com](https://yaoapps.com)\n\n**🚀 Quick Start:** [https://yaoapps.com/docs/documentation/en-us/getting-started](https://yaoapps.com/docs/documentation/en-us/getting-started#quickstart)\n\n**📚 Documentation:** [https://yaoapps.com/docs](https://yaoapps.com/docs)\n\n**✨ Why Yao?** [https://yaoapps.com/docs/why-yao](https://yaoapps.com/docs/documentation/en-us/getting-started/why-yao)\n\n## Features\n\nYao is effective in both human and machine programming, with each being independent, allowing for seamless switching between the two.\n\n### 🔮 AI First\n\nWe have designed a human-machine-friendly DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that makes both AI-generated and manually written code more efficient, enabling easy transitions between the two.\n\nTypically, AI generates the initial code, and developers make modifications, significantly boosting development efficiency. In practice, AI can handle 80% to 90% of the work, allowing developers to focus on the remaining 10% to 20%.\n\n### 🔮 All-in-One\n\nYao is an all-in-one solution for web development, requiring no additional packages or toolchain dependencies. It ships as a single executable file that includes everything you need to get started.\n\nThis greatly reduces the complexity of interacting with AI, significantly improving both the efficiency and quality of the generated code. It also eliminates many unnecessary tasks, allowing developers to focus on more important aspects.\n\n### 🔮 Native TypeScript Support\n\nYao includes a built-in V8 engine with TypeScript support, allowing direct code execution and providing hundreds of APIs for databases, files, caching, and more, with multiple ways to add extensions.\n\nYao offers comprehensive programming capabilities, so you don’t have to worry about being unable to implement certain features.\n\n### 🔮 Multiple Coding Approaches\n\nCombine AI-generated code, visual editing, and manual coding within the same project, with generated code that is easy to read and manually modify.\n\nOnce you understand how Yao works and its DSL, you can easily develop a code generator or AI agent tailored to your business needs.\n\n### 🔮 Serverless\n\nLaunch in seconds with built-in cloud functions and API gateways to easily create server-side apps. Integrate seamlessly with the DevOps ecosystem for one-click deployment.\n\n### 🔮 Edge Devices Support\n\nYao apps also support running on edge devices equipped with arm64 or x64 chips, suitable for various scenarios in IoT applications.\n"
