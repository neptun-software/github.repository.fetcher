Learn more [here](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/10/ko-applies-to-become-a-cncf-sandbox-project.html)!\n\n`ko` is a simple, fast container image builder for Go applications.\n\nIt's ideal for use cases where your image contains a single Go application\nwithout any/many dependencies on the OS base image (e.g., no cgo, no OS package\ndependencies).\n\n`ko` builds images by effectively executing `go build` on your local machine,\nand as such doesn't require `docker` to be installed. This can make it a good\nfit for lightweight CI/CD use cases.\n\n`ko` makes [multi-platform builds](https://ko.build/features/multi-platform/) easy, produces [SBOMs](https://ko.build/features/sboms/) by default, and includes support for simple YAML templating which makes it a powerful tool for [Kubernetes applications](https://ko.build/features/k8s/).\n\n# [Install `ko`](https://ko.build/install/) and [get started](https://ko.build/get-started/)!\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis work is based heavily on experience from having built the [Docker](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_k8s) support for [Bazel](https://bazel.build).\nThat work was presented [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS1aiQqgUTA).\n\n### Discuss\n\nQuestions? Comments? Ideas?\nCome discuss `ko` with us in the `#ko-build` channel on the [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io)!\nSee you there!\n\n### Community Meetings\n\nYou can find all the necessary details about the community meetings in this [page](https://ko.build/community).\n"
