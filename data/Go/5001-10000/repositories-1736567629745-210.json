With the release of version `0.27.0` it is now removed.\nA successful HTTP request to any of the `v1` endpoints will log and return a deprecation message while responding with a status code of `410`.\nPlease ensure you switch to the `v2` equivalent endpoint in your integrations before upgrading.\n\n### Alertmanager support for all UTF-8 characters in matchers and label names\n\nStarting with Alertmanager `v0.27.0`, we have a new parser for matchers that has a number of backwards incompatible changes. While most matchers will be forward-compatible, some will not. Alertmanager is operating a transition period where it supports both UTF-8 and classic matchers, so **it's entirely safe to upgrade without any additional configuration**. With that said, we recommend the following:\n\n- If this is a new Alertmanager installation, we recommend enabling UTF-8 strict mode before creating an Alertmanager configuration file. You can enable strict mode with `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"utf8-strict-mode\"`.\n\n- If this is an existing Alertmanager installation, we recommend running the Alertmanager in the default mode called fallback mode before enabling UTF-8 strict mode. In this mode, Alertmanager will log a warning if you need to make any changes to your configuration file before UTF-8 strict mode can be enabled. **Alertmanager will make UTF-8 strict mode the default in the next two versions**, so it's important to transition as soon as possible.\n\nIrrespective of whether an Alertmanager installation is a new or existing installation, you can also use `amtool` to validate that an Alertmanager configuration file is compatible with UTF-8 strict mode before enabling it in Alertmanager server by running `amtool check-config config.yml` and inspecting the log messages.\n\nShould you encounter any problems, you can run the Alertmanager with just the classic parser enabled by running `alertmanager --config.file=config.yml --enable-feature=\"classic-mode\"`. If so, please submit a bug report via GitHub issues.\n\n## 0.26.0 / 2023-08-23\n\n* [SECURITY] Fix stored XSS via the /api/v1/alerts endpoint in the Alertmanager UI.

previous amtool version (#1798) related to backup and\nimport of silences. If a backup of silences is created using a previous\nversion of amtool (v0.16.1 or earlier), it is possible that not all silences\ncan be correctly imported using a later version of amtool.\n\nAdditionally, the groups endpoint that was dropped from api v1 has been added\nto api v2. The default for viewing alerts in the UI now consumes from this\nendpoint and displays alerts grouped according to the groups defined in the\nrunning configuration. Custom grouping is still supported.\n\nThis release has added two new flags that may need to be tweaked. For people\nrunning with a lot of concurrent requests, consider increasing the value of\n`--web.get-concurrency`. An increase in 503 errors indicates that the request\nrate is exceeding the number of currently available workers. The other new\nflag, --web.timeout, limits the time a request is allowed to run. The default\nbehavior is to not use a timeout.\n\n* [CHANGE] Modify the self-inhibition prevention semantics (#1873)\n* [CHANGE] Make api/v2/status.cluster.{name,peers} properties optional for Alertmanager with disabled clustering (#1728)\n* [FEATURE] Add groups endpoint to v2 api (#1791)\n* [FEATURE] Optional timeout for HTTP requests (#1743)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Set HTTP headers to prevent asset caching (#1817)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] API returns current silenced/inhibited state of alerts (#1733)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Configurable concurrency limit for GET requests (#1743)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Pushover notifier: support HTML, URL title and custom sounds (#1634)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Support adding custom fields to VictorOps notifications (#1420)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Migrate amtool CLI to API v2 (#1798)\n* [ENHANCEMENT][ui] Default alert list view grouped by configured alert groups (#1864)\n* [ENHANCEMENT][ui] Remove superfluous inhibited/silenced text, show inhibited status (#1698, #1862)\n* [ENHANCEMENT][ui] Silence preview now shows already-muted alerts (#1776)\n* [ENHANCEMENT][ui] Sort silences from api/v2 similarly to api/v1 (#1786)\n* [BUGFIX] Trim PagerDuty message summary to 1024 chars (#1701)\n* [BUGFIX] Add fix for race causing alerts to be dropped (#1843)\n* [BUGFIX][ui] Correctly construct filter query string for api (#1869)\n* [BUGFIX][ui] Do not display GroupByAll and GroupBy in marshaled config (#1665)\n* [BUGFIX][ui] Respect regex setting when creating silences (#1697)\n\n## 0.16.2 / 2019-04-03\n\nUpdating to v0.16.2 is recommended for all users using the Slack, Pagerduty,\nHipchat, Wechat, VictorOps and Pushover notifier, as connection errors could\nleak secrets embedded in the notifier's URL to stdout.\n\n* [BUGFIX] Redact notifier URL from logs to not leak secrets embedded in the URL (#1822, #1825)\n* [BUGFIX] Allow sending of unauthenticated SMTP requests when `smtp_auth_username` is not supplied (#1739)\n\n## 0.16.1 / 2019-01-31\n\n* [BUGFIX] Do not populate cluster info if clustering is disabled in API v2 (#1726)\n\n## 0.16.0 / 2019-01-17\n\nThis release introduces a new API v2, fully generated via the OpenAPI project\n[1].

It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct [receiver integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#receiver) such as email, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or many other [mechanisms](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#alertmanager-webhook-receiver) thanks to the webhook receiver. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.\n\n* [Documentation](http://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/)\n\n## Install\n\nThere are various ways of installing Alertmanager.\n\n### Precompiled binaries\n\nPrecompiled binaries for released versions are available in the\n[*download* section](https://prometheus.io/download/)\non [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io). Using the latest production release binary\nis the recommended way of installing Alertmanager.\n\n### Docker images\n\nDocker images are available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/alertmanager) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/alertmanager/).\n\nYou can launch an Alertmanager container for trying it out with\n\n    $ docker run --name alertmanager -d -p 127.0.0.1:9093:9093 quay.io/prometheus/alertmanager\n\nAlertmanager will now be reachable at http://localhost:9093/.\n\n### Compiling the binary\n\nYou can either `go get` it:\n\n```\n$ GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1 go get github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/cmd/...\n# cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus/alertmanager\n$ alertmanager --config.file=<your_file>\n```\n\nOr clone the repository and build manually:\n\n```\n$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus\n$ git clone https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager.git\n$ cd alertmanager\n$ make build\n$ ./alertmanager --config.file=<your_file>\n```\n\nYou can also build just one of the binaries in this repo by passing a name to the build function:\n```\n$ make build BINARIES=amtool\n```\n\n## Example\n\nThis is an example configuration that should cover most relevant aspects of the new YAML configuration format. The full documentation of the configuration can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/).\n\n```yaml\nglobal:\n  # The smarthost and SMTP sender used for mail notifications.\n  smtp_smarthost: 'localhost:25'\n  smtp_from: 'alertmanager@example.org'\n\n# The root route on which each incoming alert enters.\nroute:\n  # The root route must not have any matchers as it is the entry point for\n  # all alerts. It needs to have a receiver configured so alerts that do not\n  # match any of the sub-routes are sent to someone.\n  receiver: 'team-X-mails'\n\n  # The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,\n  # multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would\n  # be batched into a single group.\n  #\n  # To aggregate by all possible labels use '...' as the sole label name.\n  # This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all\n  # alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have\n  # a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs\n  # its own grouping. Example: group_by: [...]\n  group_by: ['alertname', 'cluster']\n\n  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at\n  # least 'group_wait' to send the initial notification.\n  # This way ensures that you get multiple alerts for the same group that start\n  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first\n  # notification.\n  group_wait: 30s\n\n  # When the first notification was sent, wait 'group_interval' to send a batch\n  # of new alerts that started firing for that group.\n  group_interval: 5m\n\n  # If an alert has successfully been sent, wait 'repeat_interval' to\n  # resend them.\n  repeat_interval: 3h\n\n  # All the above attributes are inherited by all child routes and can\n  # overwritten on each.\n\n  # The child route trees.\n  routes:\n  # This route performs a regular expression match on alert labels to\n  # catch alerts that are related to a list of services.\n  - matchers:\n    - service=~\"^(foo1|foo2|baz)$\"\n    receiver: team-X-mails\n\n    # The service has a sub-route for critical alerts, any alerts\n    # that do not match, i.e. severity != critical, fall-back to the\n    # parent node and are sent to 'team-X-mails'\n    routes:\n    - matchers:\n      - severity=\"critical\"\n      receiver: team-X-pager\n\n  - matchers:\n    - service=\"files\"\n    receiver: team-Y-mails\n\n    routes:\n    - matchers:\n      - severity=\"critical\"\n      receiver: team-Y-pager\n\n  # This route handles all alerts coming from a database service.

This API is fully generated via the\n[OpenAPI project](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)\nand [Go Swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/) with the exception\nof the HTTP handlers themselves. The API specification can be found in\n[api/v2/openapi.yaml](api/v2/openapi.yaml). A HTML rendered version can be\naccessed [here](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus/alertmanager/main/api/v2/openapi.yaml).\nClients can be easily generated via any OpenAPI generator for all major languages.\n\nWith the default config, endpoints are accessed under a `/api/v1` or `/api/v2` prefix.\nThe v2 `/status` endpoint would be `/api/v2/status`. If `--web.route-prefix` is set then API routes are\nprefixed with that as well, so `--web.route-prefix=/alertmanager/` would\nrelate to `/alertmanager/api/v2/status`.\n\n_API v2 is still under heavy development and thereby subject to change._\n\n## amtool\n\n`amtool` is a cli tool for interacting with the Alertmanager API. It is bundled with all releases of Alertmanager.\n\n### Install\n\nAlternatively you can install with:\n```\n$ go install github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/cmd/amtool@latest\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nView all currently firing alerts:\n```\n$ amtool alert\nAlertname        Starts At                Summary\nTest_Alert       2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!\nTest_Alert       2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!\nCheck_Foo_Fails  2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!\nCheck_Foo_Fails  2017-08-02 18:30:18 UTC  This is a testing alert!\n```\n\nView all currently firing alerts with extended output:\n```\n$ amtool -o extended alert\nLabels                                        Annotations                                                    Starts At                Ends At                  Generator URL\nalertname=\"Test_Alert\" instance=\"node0\"       link=\"https://example.com\" summary=\"This is a testing alert!\"  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local\nalertname=\"Test_Alert\" instance=\"node1\"       link=\"https://example.com\" summary=\"This is a testing alert!\"  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local\nalertname=\"Check_Foo_Fails\" instance=\"node0\"  link=\"https://example.com\" summary=\"This is a testing alert!\"  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local\nalertname=\"Check_Foo_Fails\" instance=\"node1\"  link=\"https://example.com\" summary=\"This is a testing alert!\"  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local\n```\n\nIn addition to viewing alerts, you can use the rich query syntax provided by Alertmanager:\n```\n$ amtool -o extended alert query alertname=\"Test_Alert\"\nLabels                                   Annotations                                                    Starts At                Ends At                  Generator URL\nalertname=\"Test_Alert\" instance=\"node0\"  link=\"https://example.com\" summary=\"This is a testing alert!\"  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local\nalertname=\"Test_Alert\" instance=\"node1\"  link=\"https://example.com\" summary=\"This is a testing alert!\"  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local\n\n$ amtool -o extended alert query instance=~\".+1\"\nLabels                                        Annotations                                                    Starts At                Ends At                  Generator URL\nalertname=\"Test_Alert\" instance=\"node1\"       link=\"https://example.com\" summary=\"This is a testing alert!\"  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local\nalertname=\"Check_Foo_Fails\" instance=\"node1\"  link=\"https://example.com\" summary=\"This is a testing alert!\"  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local\n\n$ amtool -o extended alert query alertname=~\"Test.*\" instance=~\".+1\"\nLabels                                   Annotations                                                    Starts At                Ends At                  Generator URL\nalertname=\"Test_Alert\" instance=\"node1\"  link=\"https://example.com\" summary=\"This is a testing alert!\"  2017-08-02 18:31:24 UTC  0001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  http://my.testing.script.local\n```\n\nSilence an alert:\n```\n$ amtool silence add alertname=Test_Alert\nb3ede22e-ca14-4aa0-932c-ca2f3445f926\n\n$ amtool silence add alertname=\"Test_Alert\" instance=~\".+0\"\ne48cb58a-0b17-49ba-b734-3585139b1d25\n```\n\nView silences:\n```\n$ amtool silence query\nID                                    Matchers              Ends At                  Created By  Comment\nb3ede22e-ca14-4aa0-932c-ca2f3445f926  alertname=Test_Alert  2017-08-02 19:54:50 UTC  kellel\n\n$ amtool silence query instance=~\".+0\"\nID                                    Matchers                            Ends At                  Created By  Comment\ne48cb58a-0b17-49ba-b734-3585139b1d25  alertname=Test_Alert instance=~.+0  2017-08-02 22:41:39 UTC  kellel\n```\n\nExpire a silence:\n```\n$ amtool silence expire b3ede22e-ca14-4aa0-932c-ca2f3445f926\n```\n\nExpire all silences matching a query:\n```\n$ amtool silence query instance=~\".+0\"\nID                                    Matchers                            Ends At                  Created By  Comment\ne48cb58a-0b17-49ba-b734-3585139b1d25  alertname=Test_Alert instance=~.+0  2017-08-02 22:41:39 UTC  kellel\n\n$ amtool silence expire $(amtool silence query -q instance=~\".+0\")\n\n$ amtool silence query instance=~\".+0\"\n\n```\n\nExpire all silences:\n```\n$ amtool silence expire $(amtool silence query -q)\n```\n\nTry out how a template works. Let's say you have this in your configuration file:\n```\ntemplates:\n  - '/foo/bar/*.tmpl'\n```\n\nThen you can test out how a template would look like with example by using this command:\n```\namtool template render --template.glob='/foo/bar/*.tmpl' --template.text='{{ template \"slack.default.markdown.v1\" . }}'\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n`amtool` allows a configuration file to specify some options for convenience. The default configuration file paths are `$HOME/.config/amtool/config.yml` or `/etc/amtool/config.yml`\n\nAn example configuration file might look like the following:\n\n```\n# Define the path that `amtool` can find your `alertmanager` instance\nalertmanager.url: \"http://localhost:9093\"\n\n# Override the default author. (unset defaults to your username)\nauthor: me@example.com\n\n# Force amtool to give you an error if you don't include a comment on a silence\ncomment_required: true\n\n# Set a default output format. (unset defaults to simple)\noutput: extended\n\n# Set a default receiver\nreceiver: team-X-pager\n```\n\n### Routes\n\n`amtool` allows you to visualize the routes of your configuration in form of text tree view.\nAlso you can use it to test the routing by passing it label set of an alert\nand it prints out all receivers the alert would match ordered and separated by `,`.\n(If you use `--verify.receivers` amtool returns error code 1 on mismatch)\n\nExample of usage:\n```\n# View routing tree of remote Alertmanager\n$ amtool config routes --alertmanager.url=http://localhost:9090\n\n# Test if alert matches expected receiver\n$ amtool config routes test --config.file=doc/examples/simple.yml --tree --verify.receivers=team-X-pager service=database owner=team-X\n```\n\n## High Availability\n\nAlertmanager's high availability is in production use at many companies and is enabled by default.\n\n> Important: Both UDP and TCP are needed in alertmanager 0.15 and higher for the cluster to work.\n>  - If you are using a firewall, make sure to whitelist the clustering port for both protocols.\n>  - If you are running in a container, make sure to expose the clustering port for both protocols.\n\nTo create a highly available cluster of the Alertmanager the instances need to\nbe configured to communicate with each other. This is configured using the\n`--cluster.*` flags.\n\n- `--cluster.listen-address` string: cluster listen address (default \"0.0.0.0:9094\"; empty string disables HA mode)\n- `--cluster.advertise-address` string: cluster advertise address\n- `--cluster.peer` value: initial peers (repeat flag for each additional peer)\n- `--cluster.peer-timeout` value: peer timeout period (default \"15s\")\n- `--cluster.gossip-interval` value: cluster message propagation speed\n  (default \"200ms\")\n- `--cluster.pushpull-interval` value: lower values will increase\n  convergence speeds at expense of bandwidth (default \"1m0s\")\n- `--cluster.settle-timeout` value: maximum time to wait for cluster\n  connections to settle before evaluating notifications.\n- `--cluster.tcp-timeout` value: timeout value for tcp connections, reads and writes (default \"10s\")\n- `--cluster.probe-timeout` value: time to wait for ack before marking node unhealthy\n  (default \"500ms\")\n- `--cluster.probe-interval` value: interval between random node probes (default \"1s\")\n- `--cluster.reconnect-interval` value: interval between attempting to reconnect to lost peers (default \"10s\")\n- `--cluster.reconnect-timeout` value: length of time to attempt to reconnect to a lost peer (default: \"6h0m0s\")\n- `--cluster.label` value: the label is an optional string to include on each packet and stream. It uniquely identifies the cluster and prevents cross-communication issues when sending gossip messages (default:\"\")\n\nThe chosen port in the `cluster.listen-address` flag is the port that needs to be\nspecified in the `cluster.peer` flag of the other peers.\n\nThe `cluster.advertise-address` flag is required if the instance doesn't have\nan IP address that is part of [RFC 6890](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6890)\nwith a default route.\n\nTo start a cluster of three peers on your local machine use [`goreman`](https://github.com/mattn/goreman) and the\nProcfile within this repository.\n\n\tgoreman start\n\nTo point your Prometheus 1.4, or later, instance to multiple Alertmanagers, configure them\nin your `prometheus.yml` configuration file, for example:\n\n```yaml\nalerting:\n  alertmanagers:\n  - static_configs:\n    - targets:\n      - alertmanager1:9093\n      - alertmanager2:9093\n      - alertmanager3:9093\n```\n\n> Important: Do not load balance traffic between Prometheus and its Alertmanagers, but instead point Prometheus to a list of all Alertmanagers. The Alertmanager implementation expects all alerts to be sent to all Alertmanagers to ensure high availability.\n\n### Turn off high availability\n\nIf running Alertmanager in high availability mode is not desired, setting `--cluster.listen-address=` prevents Alertmanager from listening to incoming peer requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck the [Prometheus contributing page](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute to the user interface, refer to [ui/app/CONTRIBUTING.md](ui/app/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Architecture\n\n![](doc/arch.svg)\n\n## License\n\nApache License 2.0, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n[hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/alertmanager/\n[circleci]: https://circleci.com/gh/prometheus/alertmanager\n[quay]: https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/alertmanager\n"
