[GH-439]\n * agent: Added the ability to tune the broadcast timeout, which might be necessary in very large clusters that experience very large, simultaneous changes to the cluster. [GH-412]\n * agent: Added a checksum to UDP gossip messages to guard against packet corruption. [GH-432]\n * agent: Added a short window where gossip will still flow to dead nodes so that they can more quickly refute. [GH-440]\n * build: Serf now builds with Go 1.7.5. [GH-443]\n\n## 0.8 (September 14, 2016)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Lifeguard Updates:** Implemented a new set of feedback controls for the gossip layer that help prevent degraded nodes that can't meet the soft real-time requirements from erroneously causing flapping in other, healthy nodes.

[GH-139]\n\n * Automatic conflict resolution. Serf will detect name conflicts, and use an\n internal query to determine which node is in the minority and perform a shutdown.\n [GH-167] [GH-119]\n\n * New `reachability` command can be used to help diagnose network and configuration\n issues.\n\n * Added `member-reap` event to get notified of when Serf removes a failed or left\n node from the cluster. The reap interval is controlled by `reconnect_timeout` and\n `tombstone_timeout` respectively. [GH-172]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * New Recipes section on the site to share Serf tips. Thanks to @ryanuber. [GH-177]\n\n * `members` command has new `-name` filter flag. Thanks to @ryanuber [GH-164]\n\n * New RPC command \"members-filtered\" to move filtering logic to the agent.\n Thanks to @ryanuber.

[GH-155]\n\n * `tombstone_interval` can be provided to configure the reap time for nodes\n that have gracefully left. [GH_172]\n\n * Agent can be provided `rpc_auth` config to require that RPC is authenticated.\n All commands can take a `-rpc-auth` flag now. [GH-148]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * Fixed config folder in Upstart script. Thanks to @llchen223. [GH-174]\n\n * Event handlers are correctly invoked when BusyBox is the shell. [GH-156]\n\n * Event handlers were not being invoked with the correct SERF_TAG_* values\n if tags were changed using the `tags` command. [GH-169]\n\nMISC:\n\n  * Support for protocol version 1 (Serf 0.2) has been removed. Serf 0.5 cannot\n  join a cluster that has members running version 0.2.\n\n## 0.4.5 (February 25, 2014)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * New `tags` command is available to dynamically update tags without\n reloading the agent.

Each agent can have\n multiple key/value tags associated using `-tag`. Tags can be updated using\n a SIGHUP and are advertised to the cluster, causing the `member-update` event\n to be triggered. [GH-111] [GH-98]\n\n * Serf can automatically discover peers uing mDNS when provided the `-discover`\n flag. In network environments supporting multicast, no explicit join is needed\n to find peers. [GH-53]\n\n * Serf collects telemetry information and simple runtime profiling. Stats can\n be dumped to stderr by sending a `USR1` signal to Serf. Windows users must use\n the `BREAK` signal instead. [GH-103]\n\n * `advertise` flag can be used to set an advertise address different\n from the bind address. Used for NAT traversal. Thanks to @benagricola [GH-93]\n\n * `members` command now takes `-format` flag to specify either text or JSON\n output. Fixed by @ryanuber [GH-97]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * User payload always appends a newline when invoking a shell script\n\n * Severity of \"Potential blocking operation\" reduced to debug to prevent\n spurious messages on slow or busy machines.\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * If an agent is restarted with the same bind address but new name, it\n will not respond to the old name, causing the old name to enter the\n `failed` state, instead of having duplicate entries in the `alive` state.\n\n * `leave_on_interrupt` set to false when not specified, if\n any config file is provided. This flag is deprecated for\n `skip_leave_on_interrupt` instead. [GH-94]\n\nMISC:\n\n  * `-role` configuration has been deprecated in favor of `-tag role=foo`.\n  The flag is still supported but will generate warnings.\n\n  * Support for protocol version 0 (Serf 0.1) has been removed. Serf 0.4 cannot\n  join a cluster that has members running version 0.1.\n\n## 0.3.0 (December 5, 2013)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n  * Dynamic port support, cluster wide consistent config not necessary\n  * Snapshots to automaticaly rejoin cluster after failure and prevent replays [GH-84] [GH-71]\n  * Adding `profile` config to agent, to support WAN, LAN, and Local modes\n  * MsgPack over TCP RPC protocol which can be used to control Serf, send events, and\n  receive events with low latency.\n  * New `leave` CLI command and RPC endpoint to control graceful leaves\n  * Signal handling is controlable, graceful leave behavior on SIGINT/SIGTERM\n  can be specified\n  * SIGHUP can be used to reload configuration\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n  * Event handler provides lamport time of user events via SERF_USER_LTIME [GH-68]\n  * Memberlist encryption overhead has been reduced\n  * Filter output of `members` using regular expressions on role and status\n  * `replay_on_join` parameter to control replay with `start_join`\n  * `monitor` works even if the client is behind a NAT\n  * Serf generates warning if binding to public IP without encryption\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n  * Prevent unbounded transmit queues [GH-78]\n  * IPv6 addresses can be bound to [GH-72]\n  * Serf join won't hang on a slow/dead node [GH-70]\n  * Serf Leave won't block Shutdown [GH-1]\n\n## 0.2.1 (November 6, 2013)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n  * Member role and address not updated on re-join [GH-58]\n\n## 0.2.0 (November 1, 2013)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n  * Protocol versioning features so that upgrades can be done safely.\n    See the website on upgrading Serf for more info.\n  * Can now configure Serf with files or directories of files by specifying\n    the `-config-file` and/or `-config-dir` flags to the agent.\n  * New command `serf force-leave` can be used to force a \"failed\" node\n    to the \"left\" state.\n  * Serf now supports message encryption and verification so that it can\n    be used on untrusted networks [GH-25]\n  * The `-join` flag on `serf agent` can be used to join a cluster when\n    starting an agent. [GH-42]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n  * Random staggering of periodic routines to avoid cluster-wide\n    synchronization\n  * Push/Pull timer automatically slows down as cluster grows to avoid\n    congestion\n  * Messages are compressed to reduce bandwidth utilization\n  * `serf members` now provides node roles in output\n  * Joining a cluster will no longer replay all the old events by default,\n    but it can using the `-replay` flag.\n  * User events are coalesced by default, meaning duplicate events (by name)\n    within a short period of time are merged. [GH-8]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n  * Event handlers work on Windows now by executing commands through\n    `cmd /C` [GH-37]\n  * Nodes that previously left and rejoin won't get stuck in 'leaving' state.\n    [GH-18]\n  * Fixing alignment issues on i386 for atomic operations [GH-20]\n  * \"trace\" log level works [GH-31]\n\n## 0.1.1 (October 23, 2013)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n  * Default node name is outputted when \"serf agent\" is called with no args.\n  * Remove node from reap list after join so a fast re-join doesn't lose the\n    member.\n\n## 0.1.0 (October 23, 2013)\n\n* Initial release\n"

Fair Use\n\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\n     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’\n        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of\n      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or\n      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n      modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not\n      distributed with this file, You can\n      obtain one at\n      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.\n\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then\nYou may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant\ndirectory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\n\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n\nExhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible\n      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by\n      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.\n\n"

The Serf website was shut down on 10/02/2024. The docs\npreviously served from serf.io can be found\n[https://github.com/hashicorp/serf/blob/master/docs/index.html.markdown](https://github.com/hashicorp/serf/blob/master/docs/index.html.markdown)\n\n\n* Website: https://github.com/hashicorp/serf\n* Chat: [Gitter](https://gitter.im/hashicorp-serf/Lobby)\n* Mailing list: [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/group/serfdom/)\n\nSerf is a decentralized solution for service discovery and orchestration\nthat is lightweight, highly available, and fault tolerant.\n\nSerf runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. An efficient and lightweight gossip\nprotocol is used to communicate with other nodes. Serf can detect node failures\nand notify the rest of the cluster. An event system is built on top of\nSerf, letting you use Serf's gossip protocol to propagate events such\nas deploys, configuration changes, etc. Serf is completely masterless\nwith no single point of failure.\n\nHere are some example use cases of Serf, though there are many others:\n\n* Discovering web servers and automatically adding them to a load balancer\n* Organizing many memcached or redis nodes into a cluster, perhaps with\n  something like [twemproxy](https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy) or\n  maybe just configuring an application with the address of all the\n  nodes\n* Triggering web deploys using the event system built on top of Serf\n* Propagating changes to configuration to relevant nodes.\n* Updating DNS records to reflect cluster changes as they occur.\n* Much, much more.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nFirst, [download a pre-built Serf binary](https://releases.hashicorp.com/serf)\nfor your operating system, [compile Serf yourself](#developing-serf), or install\nusing `go get -u github.com/hashicorp/serf/cmd/serf`.\n\nNext, let's start a couple Serf agents. Agents run until they're told to quit\nand handle the communication of maintenance tasks of Serf. In a real Serf\nsetup, each node in your system will run one or more Serf agents (it can\nrun multiple agents if you're running multiple cluster types. e.g. web\nservers vs. memcached servers).\n\nStart each Serf agent in a separate terminal session so that we can see\nthe output of each. Start the first agent:\n\n```\n$ serf agent -node=foo -bind=127.0.0.1:5000 -rpc-addr=127.0.0.1:7373\n...\n```\n\nStart the second agent in another terminal session (while the first is still\nrunning):\n\n```\n$ serf agent -node=bar -bind=127.0.0.1:5001 -rpc-addr=127.0.0.1:7374\n...\n```\n\nAt this point two Serf agents are running independently but are still\nunaware of each other. Let's now tell the first agent to join an existing\ncluster (the second agent). When starting a Serf agent, you must join an\nexisting cluster by specifying at least one existing member. After this,\nSerf gossips and the remainder of the cluster becomes aware of the join.\nRun the following commands in a third terminal session.\n\n```\n$ serf join 127.0.0.1:5001\n...\n```\n\nIf you're watching your terminals, you should see both Serf agents\nbecome aware of the join. You can prove it by running `serf members`\nto see the members of the Serf cluster:\n\n```\n$ serf members\nfoo    127.0.0.1:5000    alive\nbar    127.0.0.1:5001    alive\n...\n```\n\nAt this point, you can ctrl-C or force kill either Serf agent, and they'll\nupdate their membership lists appropriately. If you ctrl-C a Serf agent,\nit will gracefully leave by notifying the cluster of its intent to leave.\nIf you force kill an agent, it will eventually (usually within seconds)\nbe detected by another member of the cluster which will notify the\ncluster of the node failure.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull, comprehensive documentation is viewable on the Serf website:\n\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/serf/tree/master/docs\n\n## Developing Serf\n\nIf you wish to work on Serf itself, you'll first need [Go](https://golang.org)\ninstalled (version 1.10+ is _required_). Make sure you have Go properly\n[installed](https://golang.org/doc/install),\nincluding setting up your [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).\n\nNext, clone this repository into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/serf` and\nthen just type `make`. In a few moments, you'll have a working `serf` executable:\n\n```\n$ make\n...\n$ bin/serf\n...\n```\n\n*NOTE: `make` will also place a copy of the executable under `$GOPATH/bin/`*\n\nSerf is first and foremost a library with a command-line interface, `serf`. The\nSerf library is independent of the command line agent, `serf`.  The `serf`\nbinary is located under `cmd/serf` and can be installed stand alone by issuing\nthe command `go get -u github.com/hashicorp/serf/cmd/serf`.  Applications using\nthe Serf library should only need to include `github.com/hashicorp/serf`.\n\nTests can be run by typing `make test`.\n\nIf you make any changes to the code, run `make format` in order to automatically\nformat the code according to Go [standards](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting).\n"
