It is a perfect way to implement common patterns: auth, logging, tracing, metrics, validation, retries, rate limiting and more, which can be a great generic building blocks that make it easy to build multiple microservices easily.\n\nEspecially for observability signals (logging, tracing, metrics) interceptors offers semi-auto-instrumentation that improves consistency of your observability and allows great correlation techniques (e.g. exemplars and trace ID in logs). Demo-ed in [examples](examples).\n\nThis repository offers ready-to-use middlewares that implements gRPC interceptors with examples. In some cases dedicated projects offer great interceptors, so this repository skips those, and we link them in the [interceptors](#interceptors) list.\n\n> NOTE: Some middlewares are quite simple to write, so feel free to use this repo as template if you need. It's ok to copy some simpler interceptors if you need more flexibility. This repo can't support all the edge cases you might have.\n\nAdditional great feature of interceptors is the fact we can chain those. For example below you can find example server side chain of interceptors with full observabiliy correlation, auth and panic recovery:\n\n```go mdox-exec=\"sed -n '136,151p' examples/server/main.go\"\n\tgrpcSrv := grpc.NewServer(\n\t\tgrpc.ChainUnaryInterceptor(\n\t\t\t// Order matters e.g. tracing interceptor have to create span first for the later exemplars to work.\n\t\t\totelgrpc.UnaryServerInterceptor(),\n\t\t\tsrvMetrics.UnaryServerInterceptor(grpcprom.WithExemplarFromContext(exemplarFromContext)),\n\t\t\tlogging.UnaryServerInterceptor(interceptorLogger(rpcLogger), logging.WithFieldsFromContext(logTraceID)),\n\t\t\tselector.UnaryServerInterceptor(auth.UnaryServerInterceptor(authFn), selector.MatchFunc(allButHealthZ)),\n\t\t\trecovery.UnaryServerInterceptor(recovery.WithRecoveryHandler(grpcPanicRecoveryHandler)),\n\t\t),\n\t\tgrpc.ChainStreamInterceptor(\n\t\t\totelgrpc.StreamServerInterceptor(),\n\t\t\tsrvMetrics.StreamServerInterceptor(grpcprom.WithExemplarFromContext(exemplarFromContext)),\n\t\t\tlogging.StreamServerInterceptor(interceptorLogger(rpcLogger), logging.WithFieldsFromContext(logTraceID)),\n\t\t\tselector.StreamServerInterceptor(auth.StreamServerInterceptor(authFn), selector.MatchFunc(allButHealthZ)),\n\t\t\trecovery.StreamServerInterceptor(recovery.WithRecoveryHandler(grpcPanicRecoveryHandler)),\n\t\t),\n```\n\nThis pattern offers clean and explicit shared functionality for all your gRPC methods. Full, buildable examples can be found in [examples](examples) directory.\n\n## Interceptors\n\nThis list covers known interceptors that users use for their Go microservices (both in this repo and external). Click on each to see extended examples in `examples_test.go` (also available in [pkg.go.dev](https://godoc.org/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2))\n\nAll paths should work with `go get <path>`.\n\n#### Auth\n\n* [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/auth`](interceptors/auth) - a customizable via `AuthFunc` piece of auth middleware.\n* (external) [`google.golang.org/grpc/authz`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/authz/grpc_authz_server_interceptors.go) - more complex, customizable via auth polices (RBAC like), piece of auth middleware.\n\n#### Observability\n\n* Metrics:\n  * [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus`⚡](providers/prometheus) - Prometheus client-side and server-side monitoring middleware. Supports exemplars. Moved from deprecated now [`go-grpc-prometheus`](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus).\n  * (external) [`go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc`](https://go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc) - official OpenTelemetry interceptors (metric and tracing).\n* Logging with [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/logging`](interceptors/logging) - a customizable logging middleware offering extended per request logging. It requires logging adapter, see examples in [`interceptors/logging/examples`](interceptors/logging/examples) for `go-kit`, `log`, `logr`, `logrus`, `slog`, `zap` and `zerolog`.\n  * NOTE: Interceptors with [context](https://pkg.go.dev/context) field injections need to be chained before the adapter function.\n* Tracing:\n  * (external) [`go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc`](https://go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc) - official OpenTelemetry interceptors (metric and tracing) as used in [example](examples).\n  * (external) [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/tracing/opentracing`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware@v1.4.0/tracing/opentracing) - deprecated [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/) client-side and server-side interceptors if you still need it!\n\n#### Client\n\n* [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/retry`](interceptors/retry) - a generic gRPC response code retry mechanism, client-side middleware.\n  * NOTE: grpc-go has native retries too with advanced policies (https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/v1.54.0/examples/features/retry/client/main.go)\n* [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/timeout`](interceptors/timeout) - a generic gRPC request timeout, client-side middleware.\n\n#### Server\n\n* [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/validator`](interceptors/validator) - codegen inbound message validation from `.proto` options.\n* [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/recovery`](interceptors/recovery) - turn panics into gRPC errors (make sure to use those as \"last\" interceptor, so panic does not skip other interceptors).\n* [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/ratelimit`](interceptors/ratelimit) - grpc rate limiting by your own limiter.\n* [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/protovalidate`](interceptors/protovalidate) - message validation from `.proto` options via [protovalidate-go](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate)\n\n#### Filtering Interceptor\n\n* [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/selector`](interceptors/selector) - allow users to select given one or more interceptors in certain condition like matching service method.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **[Go](https://golang.org)**: Any one of the **three latest major** [releases](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html) are supported.\n\n## Structure of this repository\n\nThe main interceptors are available in the subdirectories of the [`interceptors` directory](interceptors) e.g. [`interceptors/validator`](interceptors/validator), [`interceptors/auth`](interceptors/auth) or [`interceptors/logging`](interceptors/logging).\n\nSome interceptors or utilities of interceptors requires opinionated code that depends on larger amount of dependencies. Those are places in `providers` directory as separate Go module, with separate versioning. For example [`providers/prometheus`](providers/prometheus) offer metrics middleware (there is no \"interceptor/metrics\" at the moment). The separate module, might be a little bit harder to discover and version in your `go.mod`, but it allows core interceptors to be ultra slim in terms of dependencies.\n\nThe [`interceptors` directory](interceptors) also holds generic interceptors that accepts [`Reporter`](interceptors/reporter.go) interface which allows creating your own middlewares with ease.\n\nAs you might notice this repository contains multiple modules with different versions ([Go Module specifics](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#faqs--multi-module-repositories)). Refer to [versions.yaml](versions.yaml) for current modules. We have main module of version 2.x.y and providers modules of lower versions. Since main module is v2, it's module path ends with `v2`:\n\n```\ngo get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/<package>\n```\n\nFor providers modules and packages, since they are v1, no version is added to the path e.g.\n\n```\ngo get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus\n```\n\n## Changes compared to v1\n\n[go-grpc-middleware v1](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware) was created near 2015 and became a popular choice for gRPC users. However, many have changed since then. The main changes of v2 compared to v1:\n\n* Path for separate, multiple Go modules in \"providers\". This allows to add in future specific providers for certain middlewares if needed. This allows interceptors to be extended without the dependency hell to the core framework (e.g. if use some other metric provider, do you want to import prometheus?). This allows greater extensibility.\n* Loggers are removed. The [`interceptors/logging`](interceptors/logging) got simplified and writing adapter for each logger is straightforward. For convenience, we will maintain examples for popular providers in [`interceptors/logging/examples`](interceptors/logging/examples), but those are meant to be copied, not imported.\n* `grpc_opentracing` interceptor was removed. This is because tracing instrumentation evolved. OpenTracing is deprecated and OpenTelemetry has now a [superior tracing interceptor](https://go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc).\n* `grpc_ctxtags` interceptor was removed. Custom tags can be added to logging fields using `logging.InjectFields`. Proto option to add logging field was clunky in practice and we don't see any use of it nowadays, so it's removed.\n* One of the most powerful interceptor was imported from https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus (repo is now deprecated). This consolidation allows easier maintenance, easier use and consistent API.\n* Chain interceptors was removed, because `grpc` implemented one.\n* Moved to the new proto API (google.golang.org/protobuf).\n* All \"deciders\", so functions that decide what to do based on gRPC service name and method (aka \"fullMethodName\") are removed (!). Use [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2/interceptors/selector`](interceptors/selector) interceptor to select what method, type or service should use what interceptor.\n* No more snake case package names. We have now single word meaningful package names. If you have collision in package names we recommend adding grpc prefix e.g. `grpcprom \"github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/providers/prometheus\"`.\n* All the options (if any) are in the form of `<package_name>.With<Option Name>`, with extensibility to add more of them.\n* `v2` is the main (default) development branch.\n\n## For Maintainers: Release Process\n\nThis assumes we want to release minor version of any module:\n\n1. Understand what has been change and what groups within [versions](versions.yaml) has to be updated.\n2. Update group version on v2 branch accordingly.\n3. Create new tag for *each module* that has to be released. For the main module `github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/v2` the tag has no prefix (e.g. v2.20.1). For providers (sub modules), the tag version has to have form e.g. `providers/<provider/v1.2.3`. See https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#faqs--multi-module-repositories for details.\n4. Once all tags are pushed, draft and create release on GitHub page, mentioning all changed tags in the title. Use auto-generation of notes and remove those that are not relevant for users (e.g. fixing docs).\n\n## License\n\n`go-grpc-middleware` is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

However, the\nupstream gRPC codebase is relatively bare bones.\n\nThis package, and most of its child packages provides commonly needed middleware for gRPC:\nclient-side interceptors for retires, server-side interceptors for input validation and auth,\nfunctions for chaining said interceptors, metadata convenience methods and more.\n\n# Chaining\n\nSimple way of turning a multiple interceptors into a single interceptor. Here's an example for\nserver chaining:\n\n\tmyServer := grpc.NewServer(\n\t    grpc.ChainStreamInterceptor(loggingStream, monitoringStream, authStream),\n\t    grpc.ChainUnaryInterceptor(loggingUnary, monitoringUnary, authUnary),\n\t)\n\nThese interceptors will be executed from left to right: logging, monitoring and auth.\n\nHere's an example for client side chaining:\n\n\tclientConn, err = grpc.Dial(\n\t    address,\n\t        grpc.WithChainUnaryInterceptor(monitoringClientUnary, retryUnary),\n\t        grpc.WithChainStreamInterceptor(monitoringClientStream, retryStream),\n\t)\n\tclient = testpb.NewTestServiceClient(clientConn)\n\tresp, err := client.PingEmpty(s.ctx, &myservice.Request{Msg: \"hello\"})\n\nThese interceptors will be executed from left to right: monitoring and then retry logic.\n\nThe retry interceptor will call every interceptor that follows it whenever when a retry happens.\n\n# Writing Your Own\n\nImplementing your own interceptor is pretty trivial: there are interfaces for that. But the interesting\nbit exposing common data to handlers (and other middleware), similarly to HTTP Middleware design.\nFor example, you may want to pass the identity of the caller from the auth interceptor all the way\nto the handling function.\n\nFor example, a client side interceptor example for auth looks like:\n\n\tfunc FakeAuthUnaryInterceptor(ctx context.Context, req any, info *grpc.UnaryServerInfo, handler grpc.UnaryHandler) (any, error) {\n\t   newCtx := context.WithValue(ctx, \"user_id\", \"john@example.com\")\n\t   return handler(newCtx, req)\n\t}\n\nUnfortunately, it's not as easy for streaming RPCs. These have the `context.Context` embedded within\nthe `grpc.ServerStream` object. To pass values through context, a wrapper (`WrappedServerStream`) is\nneeded. For example:\n\n\tfunc FakeAuthStreamingInterceptor(srv any, stream grpc.ServerStream, info *grpc.StreamServerInfo, handler grpc.StreamHandler) error {\n\t   newStream := middleware.WrapServerStream(stream)\n\t   newStream.WrappedContext = context.WithValue(ctx, \"user_id\", \"john@example.com\")\n\t   return handler(srv, newStream)\n\t}\n*/\npackage middleware\n"
