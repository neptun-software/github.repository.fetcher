It will wait for\n  in-progress plans and applies to complete. Any new actions, e.g. comments or autoplans\n  will be refused and an error comment will be posted to the PR indicating that Atlantis is shutting\n  down and the user should try again later.\n\n  In addition, a new `/status` endpoint has been added that currently only returns\n  the number of in-progress operations and whether the server is shutting down.\n\n* GitHub: A new flag `--allow-draft-prs` has been added that will re-enable the ability\n  for users to run plan and apply on GitHub draft PRs. This ability was removed in\n  v0.12.0. ([#1053](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/1053) by @cket)\n* GitHub: Preserve original commit message when automerging ([#1049](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/1049) by @pratikmallya).\n\n  This change removes the `[Atlantis] Automatically merging after successful apply` commit message\n  and instead has GitHub autogenerate the commit message similarly to how it would when\n  you click the \"Merge\" button in the UI.\n* Change log level for HTTP requests from INFO to DBUG, e.g.\n  ```\n  2020/05/26 12:16:20+0000 [INFO] server: GET /healthz – respond HTTP 200\n  2020/05/26 12:16:36+0000 [INFO] server: GET /healthz – from <IP>\n  ```\n  ([#1056](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/1056) by @tammert)\n* GitLab: Use correct link to merge requests (previously used `#<num>` instead of `!<num>`) ([#1059](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/1059) by @EppO)\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Azure DevOps: Project links link to pull requests now (Fixes [#957](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/957) by @mcdafydd)\n* GitHub: Release locks when GitHub draft PRs are closed ([#1038](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/1038) by @andrewring)\n* Ensure git-lfs is in our Docker image (Fixes [#1054](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/1054))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* If you're using the Atlantis Docker image and aren't setting the `--default-tf-version` flag\n  then the default version of Terraform will now be 0.12.26. Simply set the above\n  flag to your desired default version to avoid any issues.\n* HTTP requests are now logged as DBUG instead of INFO to reduce log spam. If you\n  still want to see these logs you must run with `--log-level=debug`.\n* Atlantis will no longer immediately shutdown when it receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM,\n  it will now wait for in-progress plans and applies to complete. To stop Atlantis\n  without waiting, send a SIGKILL.\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.13.0/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.13.0/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.13.0/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.13.0/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.13.0`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n## Diff v0.12.0..v0.13.0\nhttps://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0\n\n# v0.12.0\n\n## Description\nThis release contains one much-awaited GitHub-only feature: the ability to hide previous\nplan comments with the `--hide-prev-plan-comments` flag. It also contains\na host of other small features and fags.\n\n## Features\n* GitHub: Add `--hide-prev-plan-comments` flag. When set, previous plan comments will be marked as outdated in GitHub's UI.\n  This collapses them making a PR with lots of plan comments easier to read. ([#994](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/994) by @goodspark)\n* GitHub: Ignore draft PRs until they're changed to \"ready for review\". ([#977](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/977) by @cket)\n* Upgrade default Terraform version in Docker image to 0.12.24.\n* Set `as_user` param when sending slack notifications so the message is decorated appropriately ([#907](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/907) by @tmcevoy14)\n* Add Git LFS support ([#872](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/872) by @remilapeyre)\n* Add `--silence-vcs-status-no-plans` flag that silences VCS commit status when autoplan finds no projects to plan.\n  When set, Atlantis won't create any VCS statuses if there no projects to plan. ([#959](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/959) by @cket)\n* Add `--disable-markdown-folding` flag that disables folding for long plan/apply outputs. ([#960](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/960) by @mhumeSF)\n* Ignore casing when setting log levels, e.g. `--log-level=INFO` now works. ([#976](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/976) by @jpreese)\n* Azure DevOps: Add policy checking. ([#984](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/984) by @jpreese)\n* Upgrade boltdb to latest maintained version. ([#992](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/992) by @amasover)\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Azure DevOps: Prevent pull request updated events from triggering autoplan when the event was caused by a change in approvals. (Fixes [#946](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/946) by @mcdafydd)\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* GitHub draft PRs are now ignored until they're marked \"ready for review\" and opened as regular PRs.\n  **NOTE: ** This functionality was added back in Atlantis v0.13.0 via the `--allow-draft-prs` flag.\n* If you're using the Atlantis Docker image and aren't setting the `--default-tf-version` flag\n  then the default version of Terraform will now be 0.12.24.

It's highly recommended that all\nAtlantis users upgrade to this release. See the Security\nsection below for more details.\n\n## Security\n* Additional arguments specified in Atlantis comments, ex. `atlantis plan -- -var=foo=bar`\n  are now escaped before being appended to the relevant Terraform command. (Fixes [#697](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/697)).\n  Previously, a comment like `atlantis plan -- -var=$(touch foo)` would execute\n  the `touch foo` command because the extra arguments weren't being escaped properly.\n  This means anyone with comment access to an Atlantis repo could execute arbitrary\n  code. Because of the severity of this issue, all users should upgrade to this version.\n* Upgrade to latest version of Alpine Linux in our Docker image to mitigate\n  vulnerabilities found in libssh2. (Fixes [#687](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/687))\n\n## Features\n* Upgrade Terraform to 0.12.3 in our base Docker image.\n* Additional arguments specified in Atlantis comments, ex. `atlantis plan -- -var=foo=bar`\n  are now available in custom run steps as the `COMMENT_ARGS` environment variable. (Fixes [#670](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/670))\n* A new flag `--tfe-hostname` is available for specifying a Terraform Enterprise private installation's hostname\n  when using the remote backend integration. ([#706](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/706))\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Parse Bitbucket Cloud pull request rejected events properly. (Fixes [#676](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/676))\n* Terraform >= 0.12.0 works with Terraform Cloud/Enterprise remote operations. (Fixes [#704](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/704))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* If you were previously relying on being able to execute code in the additional\n  arguments of comments, ex. `atlantis plan -- -var='foo=$(echo $SECRET)'` this\n  is no longer possible. Instead you will need to write a custom workflow with a\n  custom step or the extra_args config.\n* If you're using the Atlantis Docker image and aren't setting the `--default-tf-version` flag\n  then the default version of Terraform will now be 0.12.3.

Read [docs](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/server-side-repo-config.html) for more details.\n\n## Features\n* Server-Side Repo Config. Read [docs](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/server-side-repo-config.html)\n  and [use cases](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/server-side-repo-config.html#use-cases) for full details. ([#47](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/47))\n  * New flag `atlantis server` flag `--repo-config` for specifying the\n    repo config file .\n  * New flag `--repo-config-json` for specifying the repo config as a JSON string\n    instead of having to write a config file to disk.\n  * All repos can now create `atlantis.yaml` files to configure their projects,\n    however by default, those files can't create custom workflows or set Apply\n    Requirements.\n* New version `3` of `atlantis.yaml` fixes a small issue with how we were parsing\n  custom `run` steps. Previously we were doing additional parsing which caused some\n  users to have to add extra escaping to their commands. Now this is no longer\n  required. See the Backwards Compatibility section for more details.\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Fix bug where running `atlantis apply` to apply all outstanding plans wouldn't work if\n  you had more than one project defined in the exact same directory and workspace. (Fixes [#365](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/365))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* The server-side config changes are fully backwards compatible. The biggest\n  difference is that all repos can now create `atlantis.yaml` files, but without\n  being able to create custom workflows or set apply requirements. This will\n  allow users to configure their projects, workspaces and terraform versions\n  at a repo level without enabling those repos to run custom code or circumvent\n  apply requirements set server-side.\n* `atlantis.yaml` has a new version `3`. If you continue to use version `2`, you\n  will experience no changes. If you want to upgrade to version `3`, then\n  if you're not using any custom `run` steps in your workflows you can upgrade\n  the version number without additional changes.\n\n  If you are using `run` steps, check our [upgrade guide](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/upgrading-atlantis-yaml.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3)\n  to see if you need to make any changes before upgrading.\n* Flags `--require-approval`, `--require-mergeable` and `--allow-repo-config` are\n  deprecated in favour of creating a server-side repo config file that applies\n  the same configuration. If you run `atlantis server` with those flags, a\n  deprecation warning will be printed telling you what server-side config is\n  recommended instead.\n* If you have projects configured with the same directory and workspace (which means\n  you're probably using the `-backend-config` flag) **and** their names contain `/`'s,\n  then you'll have to re-run `atlantis plan` after upgrading if you had any unapplied plans.\n\n  An example of what config would mean you need to re-plan:\n  ```yaml\n  projects:\n  - name: name/with/slashes\n    dir: samedir\n    workflow: a\n  - name: another/with/slashes\n    dir: samedir\n    workflow: b\n  a:\n     plan:\n       steps:\n       - run: rm -rf .terraform\n       - init:\n           extra_args: [-backend-config=staging.backend.tfvars]\n       - plan\n  b:\n     plan:\n       steps:\n       - run: rm -rf .terraform\n       - init:\n           extra_args: [-backend-config=staging.backend.tfvars]\n       - plan\n  ```\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.7.0/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.7.0/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.7.0/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.7.0/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.7.0`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n## Diff v0.6.0..v0.7.0\nhttps://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0\n\n# v0.6.0\n\n## Description\nThis release introduces a new flag `--default-tf-version=<version>` that allows users\nto set the version of Terraform that Atlantis defaults to. Atlantis will automatically\ndownload that version on startup so users don't need to build their own custom\nDocker images.\n\nAtlantis will also now automatically download any Terraform version specified in\n`atlantis.yaml`:\n```yaml\nversion: 2\nprojects:\n- dir: .\n  terraform_version: v0.12.0-beta1 # Will be downloaded automatically.\n```\n\n## Features\n* New flag: `--default-tf-version=<version>` will cause Atlantis to automatically download\n  and use that version of Terraform by default. Atlantis will also automatically\n  download terraform versions specified in `atlantis.yaml` via the `terraform_version`\n  config key. ([#538](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/538))\n* New status check names mean that the Atlantis checks will appear together (at least on GitHub).\n  ([#545](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/545))\n* Upgrade base Docker image to use Alpine 3.9. Alpine 3.9 mitigates\n  [CVE-2018-19486](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19486). ([#541](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/541))\n\n## Bugfixes\nNone\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* Our Docker image `runatlantis/atlantis` has Terraform `v0.11.13` now. If you\n  use the new flag `--default-tf-version=<desired version>` then you won't\n  be affected by this change (nor for subsequent version upgrades).\n* The Atlantis status checks have been renamed from what they looked like in `v0.5.*`.\n  Previously the names were: `plan/atlantis` and `apply/atlantis`. Now the\n  names are `atlantis/plan` and `atlantis/apply`.\n\n  This change will only affect you if you're requiring those status checks to pass via a setting in\n  your Git host (ex. via GitHub protected branches). If so, you'll need to change\n  your settings to require the new names to pass and un-require the old names.\n\n  > If you were on a version lower than `v0.5.*` then read the backwards compatibility\n    notes for release `0.5.0`.\n\n  **NOTE from the maintainer**: I take backwards compatibility seriously and I\n  apologize that the status checks are changing again so soon after the 0.5 release\n  also changed them. I know that if you have many repos and require the checks\n  to pass that it is a large task to change them all again.\n\n  In this case, I decided that the tradeoff was worth it because the\n  0.5 release has only been out for a couple of weeks so hopefully not everyone\n  has upgraded to it. The new check names makes them a lot easier to read\n  (at least on GitHub) because they appear next to each other now due to\n  alphabetical sorting. In this case I felt like it was better to get this change\n  done as soon as possible rather than having this annoying UX issue stay around\n  forever.\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.6.0/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.6.0/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.6.0/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.6.0/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.6.0`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n## Diff v0.5.1..v0.6.0\nhttps://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.5.1...v0.6.0\n\n# v0.5.1\n\n## Description\nThis is a bugfix release to fix a bug where Atlantis was replying to comments\nthat weren't directed to it.\n\nDiff: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1\n\n## Features\n* On Bitbucket Cloud and Server, Atlantis now responds if it's invoked with the\n  username it's running under, ex. @my-bb-atlantis-user.

([#489](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/489))\n* Support Bitbucket Cloud's upcoming API deprecations. ([#502](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/502))\n* Support Bitbucket Server hosted at a basepath, ex. `bitbucket.mycompany.com/pathprefix` (Fixes [#508](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/508))\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Allow Bitbucket Server diagnostics checks. (Fixes [#474](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/474))\n* Fix automerge for Bitbucket Server. (Fixes [#479](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/479))\n* Run `terraform init` with `-upgrade`. (Fixes [#443](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/443))\n* If a pull request is deleted in Bitbucket Server, delete locks. (Fixes [#498](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/498))\n* Support directories with spaces, ex `atlantis plan -d 'dir with spaces'`. (Fixes [#423](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/423))\n* Ignore Terragrunt cache directories that were causing duplicate applies. (Fixes [#487](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/487))\n* Fix `atlantis testdrive` for latest version of ngrok.\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* **New Status Checks** - If you have settings in your Git host that require the Atlantis commit status\n  check to be in a certain condition, you will need to modify that setting as follows:\n\n  Previously, Atlantis set a single check with the name `Atlantis`. Now there are\n  two checks with the names `plan/atlantis` and `apply/atlantis`. If you had\n  previously required the `Atlantis` check to pass, you should now require both\n  the `plan/atlantis` and `apply/atlantis` checks to pass.\n\n  The behaviour has also changed. Previously, the single Atlantis check\n  would represent the status of the **last\n  run command**. For example, if I ran `atlantis plan` and it failed, the check\n  would be in a *Failed* state. If I ran `atlantis apply -p project1` and it succeeded,\n  then the check would be in a *Success* state, regardless of the status of other projects\n  in the pull request.\n\n  Now, each check represents the plan/apply status of **all** projects modified in\n  the pull request. For example, say I open up a pull request that modifies\n  two projects, one in directory `proj1` and the other in `proj2`. If autoplanning\n  is enabled, and both plans succeed, then there will be a single status check:\n  * `plan/atlantis - 2/2 projects planned successfully` (success)\n\n  If I run `atlantis apply -d proj1`, then Atlantis will set a pending apply check:\n  * `plan/atlantis - 2/2 projects planned successfully` (success)\n  * `apply/atlantis - 1/2 projects applied successfully` (pending)\n\n  If I apply the final project with `atlantis apply -d proj2`, then my checks\n  will look like:\n  * `plan/atlantis - 2/2 projects planned successfully` (success)\n  * `apply/atlantis - 2/2 projects applied successfully` (success)\n\n* `terraform init` is now run with `-upgrade=true`. Previously, it used Terraform's\n  default setting which was `false`.\n\n  This means that `terraform` will always update to the latest version of plugins\n  and modules. For example, if you're using a module source of\n    ```hcl\n    source = \"git::https://example.com/vpc.git?ref=master\"\n    ```\n  then `terraform init` will now always use the version on `master` whereas\n  previously, if you had already run `atlantis plan` before `master` was updated,\n  a new `atlantis plan` wouldn't pull the latest changes and would just use\n  the cached version.\n\n  This is unlikely to cause any issues because most users already expected Atlantis\n  to use the most up-to-date version of modules/plugins within the set constraints.\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.5.0/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.5.0/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.5.0/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.5.0/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.5.0`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n# v0.4.15\n\n## Description\nThis is a bugfix release containing an important fix to how Atlantis executes Terraform. A\nbug was introduced in v0.4.14 that causes Atlantis to hang indefinitely when\nexecuting Terraform when there is a lot of output from Terraform.\n\nIn addition, there's a fix to automerge when you require rebasing or commit\nsquashing in GitHub and a fix for the mergeability check if you're requiring\nthe Atlantis status to pass in GitHub.\n\nDiff: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.4.14...v0.4.15\n\n## Features\nNone – this is a bugfix release.\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Atlantis hangs on large plans.

Please use v0.4.15 instead.\n\nThis release contains two big new features: Automerge and Checkout Strategy.\n\nAutomerge is a much asked for feature that allows Atlantis to automatically\nmerge your pull requests if all plans have been applied successfully.\nIt can be enabled via the `--automerge` flag, or via an `atlantis.yaml` setting:\n```yaml\nversion: 2\nautomerge: true\nprojects:\n- ...\n```\n\nCheckout Strategy allows you to choose if Atlantis checks out the exact branch\nfrom the pull request or what the destination branch will look like once the pull\nrequest is merged. You can choose your checkout strategy via the `--checkout-strategy`\nflag which supports `branch` (the default) or `merge`.\n\nDiff: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.4.13...v0.4.14\n\n## Features\n* Can now be configured to **automatically merge pull requests** after all plans have\n  been applied. See https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/automerging.html. (Fixes [#186](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/186))\n* New `--checkout-strategy` flag which supports checking out the code as it will\n  look once the pull request was merged. Previously we only supported checking out\n  the pull request branch which might be out of date with the destination branch\n  and so cause Terraform to delete resources that have already been applied.\n  See https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/checkout-strategy.html. (Fixes [#35](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/35)\n* Support Terraform 0.12 by version detection and then changing how Atlantis runs\n  its Terraform commands. ([#419](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/419))\n* New `--tfe-token` flag to support using Terraform Enterprise's Free Remote State Storage. ([#419](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/419))\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Run plan in directory when file is moved. (Fixes [#413](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/413))\n* Fix bug where when Terraform crashed, Atlantis would hang indefinitely. ([#421](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/421))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\nNone\n\n## Downloads\n**The release downloads have been deleted because this release contains a critical bug**\n\n## Docker\n**The release downloads have been deleted because this release contains a critical bug**\n\n# v0.4.13\n\n## Description\nThis release is focused on quick-wins, bugfixes and one new feature that allows\nusers to require pull requests be \"mergeable\", before allowing for `atlantis apply`.\n\nThe mergeable apply requirement is very useful for GitHub users where it allows\nthem to require pull requests be approved by specific users or require certain\nstatus checks to pass. See https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/apply-requirements.html#mergeable for\nmore information.\n\nDiff: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.4.12...v0.4.13\n\n## Features\n* Introduce a new (optional) `mergeable` apply requirement that requires pull requests to be mergeable prior to allowing `apply` to run. (Fixes [#43](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/43))\n* If users have workspaces configured for a directory via an `atlantis.yaml` file, only allow\n    commands to be run on those workspaces. All commands attempted to be run on different workspaces will error out.\n\n    For example, if I have an `atlantis.yaml` file:\n    ```yaml\n    version: 2\n    projects:\n    - dir: mydir\n      workspace: default\n    - dir: mydir\n      workspace: staging\n    ```\n    Then I can run `atlantis apply -d mydir -w default` and `atlantis apply -d mydir -w staging`\n    but I will receive an error if I run `atlantis apply -d mydir -w somethingelse`.\n\n* If users are setting the `name` key for their projects in `atlantis.yaml`, then\n  include the project name in the comment output so it's easier to identify which\n  plan/apply output is for which project. (Fixes [#353](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/353)))\n* Bump the Terraform version in the Docker image to `0.11.11`.\n* Tweak logging to add timezone to the timestamp and make the output more readable. ([#402](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/402))\n* Warn users if running `atlantis apply -- -target=myresource` because `-target` can\n  only be specified during `atlantis plan`. (Fixes [#399](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/399))\n\n## Bugfixes\n* If `terraform plan` returns an error, print the error to the pull request. ([#381](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/381))\n* Split Bitbucket Server comments into multiple comments if over the max size. (Fixes [#280](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/280))\n* Fix issue where if users specified `--gitlab-hostname` without a scheme then Atlantis wouldn't parse the URL correctly. ([#377](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/377))\n* Give better error message if GitLab users are commenting on commits instead of a merge request. (Fixes [#150](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/150), [#390](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/390))\n* If an error occurs early in request processing, comment that error back on the pull request.\n  Previously, we *were* commenting back on errors but not for errors very early in the processing. (Fixes [#398](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/398))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* The version of Terraform installed in the `runatlantis/atlantis` Docker image\n  is now `0.11.11`. Previously it was `0.11.10`.\n* If you are a) using an `atlantis.yaml` file and b) defining Terraform workspaces\n    and c) running plan and apply against workspaces that **were not** defined in the\n    `atlantis.yaml` file, then this no longer works.\n\n    You will now need to define all the workspaces in the `atlantis.yaml` file.\n    For example, say you had the following config:\n    ```yaml\n    version: 2\n    projects:\n    - dir: mydir\n      workspace: production\n    ```\n\n    And you used to run:\n    ```\n    atlantis plan -d mydir -w anotherworkspace\n    atlantis apply -d mydir -w anotherworkspace\n    ```\n\n    For this to work now, you need to add the `anotherworkspace` workspace to your\n    `atlantis.yaml` file:\n    ```yaml\n    version: 2\n    projects:\n    - dir: mydir\n      workspace: production\n    - dir: mydir\n      workspace: anotherworkspace\n    ```\n\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.13/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.13/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.13/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.13/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.4.13`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n# v0.4.12\n\n## Description\nSmall feature and bug fix release. If you're using GitLab <11.1 then your\ncomment formatting is fixed!\n\nDiff: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.4.11...v0.4.12\n\n## Features\n- Atlantis can now be hosted behind a path-based router and its UI will still\n  render correctly. For example, you could host atlantis at mydomain.com/mypath,\n  then run `atlantis server --atlantis-url https://mydomain.com/mypath` and when\n  atlantis renders its UI, all the URLs will have the `/mypath` prefix so the UI\n  renders properly. (Fixes [#213](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/213))\n- Log warning if GitLab hostname isn't resolvable. (Fixes [#359](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/359))\n- Support running our official Docker image `runatlantis/atlantis` on OpenShift. OpenShift runs images\n  with random uids so we needed to build in support for that. (Fixes [#345](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/345))\n\n## Bugfixes\n- If the output is too long for a single GitHub comment, maintain formatting when\n  splitting into multiple comments. (Fixes [#111](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/111))\n- Fix bug with using the pagination API in BitBucket. ([#354](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/354))\n- If using GitLab < 11.1 then don't use expandable markdown comments. (Fixes [#315](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/315))\n- Fix output from custom steps that came before the plan step from being removed. ([#367](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/367))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\nWe made [changes](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/346) to the base image (`runatlantis/atlantis-base`) that\n`runatlantis/atlantis` is built off of. These changes **should not** affect your\nrunning of atlantis unless you're building your own custom images and were relying\non specific user permissions. Even then we don't anticipate any problems.\n\nThese are the changes in detail:\n1. Previously, the permissions of `/home/atlantis` were:\n     ```bash\n     $ ls -la /home/atlantis/\n     drwxr-sr-x    2 atlantis atlantis      4096 Sep 13 22:49 .\n     ```\n   Now they are:\n    ```bash\n    $ ls -la /home/atlantis/\n    drwxrwxr-x    2 atlantis root          4096 Nov 28 21:22 .\n    ```\n   * The directory is now owned by the `root` group.\n   * Its group permissions now include `w` and `x`.\n\n   This was needed because OpenShift runs Docker images as random uid's under\n   the root group and so now those random uid's can use `/home/atlantis` as their\n   data directory.\n\n1. Previously, the `atlantis` user was only part of its own group:\n    ```bash\n    $ gosu atlantis sh\n    $ whoami\n    atlantis\n    $ groups\n    atlantis\n    ```\n\n    Now it's also part of the `root` group:\n    ```bash\n    $ gosu atlantis sh\n    $ groups\n    atlantis root\n    ```\n1. Previously, the permissions for `/etc/passwd` were:\n    ```bash\n    $ ls -la /etc/passwd\n    -rw-r--r--    1 root     root          1284 Sep 13 22:49 /etc/passwd\n    ```\n\n    Now the permissions are:\n    ```bash\n    $ ls -la /etc/passwd\n    -rw-rw-r--    1 root     root          1284 Nov 28 21:22 /etc/passwd\n    ```\n\n    The `w` group permission was added so that in OpenShift, the random uid can write\n    their own login entry (https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/blob/main/docker-entrypoint.sh#L28)\n    which is required because `terraform` expects the running user to have an entry\n    in `/etc/passwd`.\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.12/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.12/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.12/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.12/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.4.12`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n# v0.4.11\n\n## Description\nMedium sized release that updates the Terraform version and makes `terraform plan`\noutput smaller by removing the `Refreshing...` output.\n\nDiff: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.4.10...v0.4.11\n\n## Features\n* Upgraded Docker image to use Terraform 0.11.10\n* `terraform plan` output is shorter now thanks to remove the `Refreshing...` output ([#339](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/339))\n* Project names specified in `atlantis.yaml` can now contain `/`'s. This is useful\nif you want to name your projects similar to the directories they're in. (Fixes [#253](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/253))\n* Added new flag `--silence-whitelist-errors` which prevents Atlantis from comment back on pull requests\nfrom non-whitelisted repos. This is useful if you want to add the Atlantis webhook to a whole organization\nand then control which repos are actioned on via the whitelist. (Fixes [#312](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/312))\n* The message when the project is locked is now more helpful. ([#336](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/336))\n* Run `terraform plan` with `-var atlantis_repo_owner=runatlantis -var atlantis_repo_name=atlantis -var atlantis_pull_num=10`\n(if the repo was runatlantis/atlantis) ([#300](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/300))\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Quote plan filenames so that Bitbucket projects with spaces in their names still work (Fixes [#302](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/302))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* Atlantis now runs `terraform plan` with\n    ```bash\n    -var atlantis_repo_owner=runatlantis \\\n    -var atlantis_repo_name=atlantis \\\n    -var atlantis_pull_num=10\n    ```\n\n    (in this example the repo that Atlantis is running on is runatlantis/atlantis).\n\n    If you were using those variables in your terraform code:\n    ```hcl\n    variable \"atlantis_repo_owner\" {\n      default = \"my_default\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Then Atlantis will be overriding those variables with its own values. To prevent\n    this, you need to rename your variables.\n\n    If you aren't using those variables then this change won't affect you.\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.11/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.11/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.11/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.11/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.4.11`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n# v0.4.10\n\n## Description\nSmall bugfix release to fix issues with new comment format.\n\nDiff: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.4.9...v0.4.10\n\n## Features\nNone\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Fix bad comment rendering ([#294](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/294))\n* Fix `plan` not working on Bitbucket Server when repo owner contains spaces ([#290](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/290))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\nNone\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.10/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.10/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.10/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.10/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.4.10`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n# v0.4.9\n\n## Description\nThis release is mostly focused on changing how comments look. Terraform output\nis now automatically hidden if it's over 12 lines long:\n![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1034429/45580771-d4603b80-b849-11e8-8c4b-5984bd0bff7f.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1034429/45580771-d4603b80-b849-11e8-8c4b-5984bd0bff7f.png)\nAlso the red and green highlighting for added and removed resources is fixed:\n![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1034429/45580777-d9bd8600-b849-11e8-8f2d-867fbf4e72d7.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1034429/45580777-d9bd8600-b849-11e8-8f2d-867fbf4e72d7.png)\n\nDiff: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.4.8...v0.4.9\n\n## Features\n* Terraform output over 12 lines is hidden in comment until expanded\n* `terraform plan` output is highlighted correctly\n* Terraform is now executed with `-var atlantis_repo={repo name} -var atlantis_pull_num {pull num}`.\nThis will allow users to trace Atlantis `terraform` executions in CloudTrail back to a specific\nuser and pull request if using assume role by creating a specific name for the session Terraform initiates.\n```\nprovider \"aws\" {\n  assume_role {\n    role_arn     = \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME\"\n    session_name = \"${var.atlantis_user}-${var.atlantis_repo}-${var.atlantis_pull_num}\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Run terraform with `-input=false` ([#268](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/268)).\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* We set two new Terraform variables: `atlantis_repo` and `atlantis_pull_num`. If\nyou were using variables with those names in your code you will need to rename them\nin your code.\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.9/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.9/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.9/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.9/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.4.9`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n# v0.4.8\n\n## Description\nSecurity release to upgrade the Docker image to the latest version of Alpine linux that fixes\nthis bug: https://justi.cz/security/2018/09/13/alpine-apk-rce.html\n\nDiff: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/compare/v0.4.7...v0.4.8\n\n## Features\nNone\n\n## Bugfixes\n* Change server startup message to INFO from WARN level.\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\nNone\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.8/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.8/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.8/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.4.8/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n## Docker\n[`runatlantis/atlantis:v0.4.8`](https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis/tags/)\n\n\n# v0.4.7\n\n## Description\nSupport GitLab repos nested under multiple levels and use the latest version of Terraform: 0.11.8!\n\n## Features\n* Support GitLab groups which allow repos to be nested under multiple levels,\nex. `gitlab.com/owner/group/subgroup/subsubgroup/repo`\n* Use latest version of Terraform: 0.11.8 in Docker image\n\n## Bugfixes\n* When running with `TF_LOG` set, Atlantis will start normally.

In my testing it saves ~20s per run.\n\n## Features\n* All config flags can now be specified by environment variables. Fixes ([#38](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/38)).\n  * Completed thanks to @psalaberria002!\n* Run terraform with the `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` env var set. Fixes ([#34](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/34)).\n  * This will cache plugins and make `terraform init` faster. Terraform will still download new versions of plugins. See https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-plugin-cache for more details.\n  * In my testing this saves >10s per run.\n* Run terraform with `TF_IN_AUTOMATION=true` so the output won't contain suggestions to run commands that you can't run via Atlantis. ([#82](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/82)).\n* Don't run `terraform workspace select` unless we actually need to switch workspaces. ([#82](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/82)).\n  * In my testing this saves ~10s.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n* Validate that workspace doesn't contain a path when running ex. `atlantis plan -w /jdlkj`. This was already not a valid workspace name according to Terraform. ([#78](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/78)).\n* Error out if `ngrok` is already running when running `atlantis bootstrap` ([#81](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/81)).\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* None\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.4/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.4/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.4/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.4/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n# v0.3.3\n\n## Features\n* Atlantis version shown in footer of web UI.

Defaults to `false`.\nThis flag was added because on a public repository anyone could open up a pull request to your repo and use your Atlantis\ninstall.\n* New mandatory flag `--repo-whitelist` added to `atlantis server` controls which repos Atlantis will operate on. This flag was added\nso that if a webhook secret is compromised (or you're not using webhook secrets) Atlantis won't be used on repos you don't control.\n* Warn if running `atlantis server` without any webhook secrets set. This is dangerous because without a webhook secret, an attacker\ncould spoof requests to Atlantis.\n* Make CLI output more readable by setting a fixed column width.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n* None\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* Must set `--allow-fork-prs` now if you want to run Atlantis on pull requests from forked repos.\n* Must set `--repo-whitelist` in order to start `atlantis server`. See `atlantis server --help` for how that flag works.\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.2/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.2/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.2/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.2/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n# v0.3.1\n## Features\n* None\n\n## Bug Fixes\n* Run apply in correct directory when using `-d` flag.

Fixes ([#245](https://github.com/hootsuite/atlantis/issues/245))\n* Don't run plan in the parent of `modules/` unless there's a `main.tf` present. Fixes ([#12](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/12))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* You must use the `-w` flag to specify a workspace when commenting now\n  * Previously: `atlantis plan staging`, now: `atlantis plan -w staging`\n* You must use a double-dash between Atlantis flags and extra args to be appended to the terraform command\n  * Previously: `atlantis plan -target=resource`, now: `atlantis plan -- -target=resource`\n* Atlantis will no longer run `plan` in the parent directory of `modules/` unless there is a `main.tf` in that directory.\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.0/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.0/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.0/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.3.0/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n# v0.2.4\n## Features\n* SSL support added ([#233](https://github.com/hootsuite/atlantis/pull/233))\n\n## Bug Fixes\n* GitLab custom URL for GitLab Enterprise installations now works ([#231](https://github.com/hootsuite/atlantis/pull/231))\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\nNone\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.2.4/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.2.4/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.2.4/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.2.4/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n# v0.2.3\n## Features\nNone\n\n## Bug Fixes\n* Use `env` instead of `workspace` for Terraform 0.9.*\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\nNone\n\n## Downloads\n* [atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.2.3/atlantis_darwin_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_386.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.2.3/atlantis_linux_386.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_amd64.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.2.3/atlantis_linux_amd64.zip)\n* [atlantis_linux_arm.zip](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/download/v0.2.3/atlantis_linux_arm.zip)\n\n# v0.2.2\n## Features\n* Terraform 0.11 is now supported ([#219](https://github.com/hootsuite/atlantis/pull/219))\n* Safe shutdown on `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` ([#215](https://github.com/hootsuite/atlantis/pull/215))\n\n## Bug Fixes\nNone\n\n## Backwards Incompatibilities / Notes:\n* The environment variables available when executing commands have changed:\n  * `WORKSPACE` => `DIR` - this is the absolute path to the project directory on disk\n  * `ENVIRONMENT` => `WORKSPACE` - this is the name of the Terraform workspace that we're running in (ex. default)\n* The schema for storing locks changed.

This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.\n* When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a gist (https://gist.github.com). Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can replace those parts with \"REDACTED\").\n\n# Reporting Security Issues\nWe take security issues seriously. Please report a security vulnerability to the maintainers using [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/security/advisories/new).\n\n# Updating The Website\n* To view the generated website locally, run `npm website:dev` and then\nopen your browser to http://localhost:8080.\n* The website will be regenerated when your pull request is merged to main.\n\n# Developing\n\n## Running Atlantis Locally\n* Clone the repo from https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/\n* Compile Atlantis:\n    ```sh\n    go install\n    ```\n* Run Atlantis:\n    ```sh\n    atlantis server --gh-user <your username> --gh-token <your token> --repo-allowlist <your repo> --gh-webhook-secret <your webhook secret> --log-level debug\n    ```\n    If you get an error like `command not found: atlantis`, ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`.\n\n## Running Atlantis With Local Changes\nDocker compose is set up to start an atlantis container and ngrok container in the same network in order to expose the atlantis instance to the internet.  In order to do this, create a file in the repository called `atlantis.env` and add the required env vars for the atlantis server configuration.\n\ne.g.\n\n```sh\nNGROK_AUTH=1234567890\n\nATLANTIS_GH_APP_ID=123\nATLANTIS_GH_APP_KEY_FILE=\"/.ssh/somekey.pem\"\nATLANTIS_GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET=12345\n```\n\nNote: `~/.ssh` is mounted to allow for referencing any local ssh keys.\n\nFollowing this just run:\n\n```sh\nmake build-service\ndocker-compose up --detach\ndocker-compose logs --follow\n```\n\n### Rebuilding\nIf the ngrok container is restarted, the url will change which is a hassle. Fortunately, when we make a code change, we can rebuild and restart the atlantis container easily without disrupting ngrok.\n\ne.g.\n\n```sh\nmake build-service\ndocker-compose up --detach --build\n```\n\n## Running Tests Locally\n`make test`. If you want to run the integration tests that actually run real `terraform` commands, run `make test-all`.\n\n## Running Tests In Docker\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -v $(pwd):/go/src/github.com/runatlantis/atlantis -w /go/src/github.com/runatlantis/atlantis ghcr.io/runatlantis/testing-env:latest make test\n```\n\nOr to run the integration tests\n\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -v $(pwd):/go/src/github.com/runatlantis/atlantis -w /go/src/github.com/runatlantis/atlantis ghcr.io/runatlantis/testing-env:latest make test-all\n```\n\n## Calling Your Local Atlantis From GitHub\n- Create a test terraform repository in your GitHub.\n- Create a personal access token for Atlantis. See [Create a GitHub token](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/tree/main/runatlantis.io/docs/access-credentials.md#generating-an-access-token).\n- Start Atlantis in server mode using that token:\n```sh\natlantis server --gh-user <your username> --gh-token <your token> --repo-allowlist <your repo> --gh-webhook-secret <your webhook secret> --log-level debug\n```\n- Download ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download. This will enable you to expose Atlantis running on your laptop to the internet so GitHub can call it.\n- When you've downloaded and extracted ngrok, run it on port `4141`:\n```sh\nngrok http 4141\n```\n- Create a Webhook in your repo and use the `https` url that `ngrok` printed out after running `ngrok http 4141`. Be sure to append `/events` so your webhook url looks something like `https://efce3bcd.ngrok.io/events`. See [Add GitHub Webhook](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/blob/main/runatlantis.io/docs/configuring-webhooks.md#configuring-webhooks).\n- Create a pull request and type `atlantis help`. You should see the request in the `ngrok` and Atlantis logs and you should also see Atlantis comment back.\n\n## Code Style\n\n### Logging\n- `ctx.Log` should be available in most methods. If not, pass it down.\n- levels:\n    - debug is for developers of atlantis\n    - info is for users (expected that people run on info level)\n    - warn is for something that might be a problem but we're not sure\n    - error is for something that's definitely a problem\n- **ALWAYS** logs should be all lowercase (when printed, the first letter of each line will be automatically capitalized)\n- **ALWAYS** quote any string variables using %q in the fmt string, ex. `ctx.Log.Info(\"cleaning clone dir %q\", dir)` => `Cleaning clone directory \"/tmp/atlantis/lkysow/atlantis-terraform-test/3\"`\n- **NEVER** use colons \"`:`\" in a log since that's used to separate error descriptions and causes\n  - if you need to have a break in your log, either use `-` or `,` ex. `failed to clean directory, continuing regardless`\n\n### Errors\n- **ALWAYS** use lowercase unless the word requires it\n- **ALWAYS** use `errors.Wrap(err, \"additional context...\")\"` instead of `fmt.Errorf(\"additional context: %s\", err)`\nbecause it is less likely to result in mistakes and gives us the ability to trace call stacks\n- **NEVER** use the words \"error occurred when...\", or \"failed to...\" or \"unable to...\", etc. Instead, describe what was occurring at\ntime of the error, ex. \"cloning repository\", \"creating AWS session\". This will prevent errors from looking like\n```\nError setting up workspace: failed to run git clone: could find git\n```\n\nand will instead look like\n```\nError: setting up workspace: running git clone: no executable \"git\"\n```\nThis is easier to read and more consistent\n\n### Testing\n- place tests under `{package under test}_test` to enforce testing the external interfaces\n- if you need to test internally i.e. access non-exported stuff, call the file `{file under test}_internal_test.go`\n- use our testing utility for easier-to-read assertions: `import . \"github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/testing\"` and then use `Assert()`, `Equals()` and `Ok()`\n\n### Mocks\nWe use [pegomock](https://github.com/petergtz/pegomock) for mocking. If you're\nmodifying any interfaces that are mocked, you'll need to regen the mocks for that\ninterface.\n\nInstall using `go install github.com/petergtz/pegomock/v4/pegomock@latest`\n\nIf you see errors like:\n```\n# github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/server/events [github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/server/events.test]\nserver/events/project_command_builder_internal_test.go:567:5: cannot use workingDir (type *MockWorkingDir) as type WorkingDir in field value:\n\t*MockWorkingDir does not implement WorkingDir (missing ListAllFiles method)\n```\n\nThen you've likely modified an interface and now need to update the mocks.\n\nEach interface that is mocked has a `go:generate` command above it, e.g.\n```go\n//go:generate pegomock generate -m --package mocks -o mocks/mock_project_command_builder.go ProjectCommandBuilder\n\ntype ProjectCommandBuilder interface {\n\tBuildAutoplanCommands(ctx *command.Context) ([]command.ProjectContext, error)\n}\n```\n\nTo regen the mock, run `go generate` on that file, e.g.\n```sh\ngo generate server/events/project_command_builder.go\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can run `make go-generate` to execute `go generate` across all packages\n\n\n# Backporting Fixes\nAtlantis now uses a [cherry-pick-bot](https://github.com/googleapis/repo-automation-bots/tree/main/packages/cherry-pick-bot) from Google. The bot assists in maintaining changes across releases branches by easily cherry-picking changes via pull requests.\n\nMaintainers and Core Contributors can add a comment to a pull request:\n\n```sh\n/cherry-pick target-branch-name\n```\n\ntarget-branch-name is the branch to cherry-pick to. cherry-pick-bot will cherry-pick the merged commit to a new branch (created from the target branch) and open a new pull request to the target branch.\n\nThe bot will immediately try to cherry-pick a merged PR. On unmerged pull request, it will not do anything immediately, but wait until merge. You can comment multiple times on a PR for multiple release branches.\n\n## Manual Backporting Fixes\nThe bot will fail to cherry-pick if the feature branches' git history is not linear (merge commits instead of rebase). In that case, you will need to manually cherry-pick the squashed merged commit from main to the release branch\n\n1. Switch to the release branch intended for the fix.\n1. Run `git cherry-pick <sha>` with the commit hash from the main branch.\n1. Push the newly cherry-picked commit up to the remote release branch.\n\n# Creating a New Release\n1. (Major/Minor release only) Create a new release branch `release-x.y`\n1. Go to https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases and click \"Draft a new release\"\n    1. Prefix version with `v` and increment based on last release.\n    1. The title of the release is the same as the tag (ex. v0.2.2)\n    1. Fill in description by clicking on the \"Generate Release Notes\" button.\n        1. You may have to manually move around some commit titles as they are determined by PR labels (see .github/labeler.yml & .github/release.yml)\n    1. (Latest Major/Minor branches only) Make sure the release is set as latest\n        1. Don't set \"latest release\" for patches on older release branches.\n1. Check and update the default version in `Chart.yaml` in [the official Helm chart](https://github.com/runatlantis/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/atlantis/values.yaml) as needed.\n"
