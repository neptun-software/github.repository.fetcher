We decided to decrease the default CPU requests from `100m` to `10m`. For most environments, this won't make a difference but if you need to increase the values, you can use the `-config-reloader-cpu-request` and `-config-reloader-cpu-limit` CLI arguments of the Prometheus operator.\n\n* [CHANGE] Decrease the default CPU requests for the config-reloader container from `100m` to `10m`. #5539\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.alertmanagerConfiguration.global.PagerdutyURL` to the `Alertmanager` CRD. #5469\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.volumeMounts` to the `ThanosRuler` CRD. #5541\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.remoteWrite.sendNativeHistograms` to `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` CRDs. #5564\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.tracingConfig` to `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` CRDs. #5591 #5640\n* [FEATURE] Add `followRedirects` field to the `RemoteRead` configuration. #5612\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.automountServiceAccountToken` to the `Alertmanager` CRD. #5474\n* [FEATURE] Support `keep_firing_for` fields for `PrometheusRule` CRD. #5651\n* [FEATURE] Allow to add custom annotations to all resources managed by the operator. #5626\n* [FEATURE] Add `BasicAuth` and `Authorization` support to `ScrapeConfig` CRD. #5642\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `-kubelet-selector` CLI argument to filter the Kubernetes nodes by labels. #5641\n* [BUGFIX] Fix bug with logs that don't end with new line(`\\n`) characters. #5566\n* [BUGFIX] Fix Prometheus and Alertmanager not picking up the web server's certificate after renewal. #5535\n* [BUGFIX] Fix config-reloader not handling SIGTERM signal. #5617\n* [BUGFIX] Fix Thanos volume name when using VolumeClaimTemplate in `Prometheus` CRD. #5596\n* [BUGFIX] Fix WAL Compression configuration for `PrometheusAgent` CRD. #5625\n* [BUGFIX] Fix DNS name resolution for individual ThanosRuler pods. #5632\n\n## 0.65.2 / 2023-05-31\n\n* [BUGFIX] Fix relabeling issue in `ScrapeConfig` CRD. #5611\n\n## 0.65.1 / 2023-05-05\n\n* [BUGFIX] Fix panic when ScrapeConfig CRD is not installed. #5550\n\n## 0.65.0 / 2023-05-04\n\nThe main change introduced by this release is the new v1alpha1 `ScrapeConfig` CRD.\nThis implements the [proposal](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/proposals/202212-scrape-config.md)\ndocumented in [#5279](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pull/5279)\nand provides a Kubernetes native API to create and manage additional scrape configurations.\n\nTo try it, follow the following steps:\n1. Install the new CRD in the cluster (see\n   `example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_scrapeconfigs.yaml`).\n2. Update the Prometheus operator's RBAC permissions to manage `ScrapeConfig` resources\n   (see `example/rbac/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator-cluster-role.yaml`).\n\n**NOTE**: if these conditions aren't met, the operator will start but it won't\nbe able to reconcile the `ScrapeConfig` resources.\n\n* [FEATURE] Add the `status` subresource for the `ThanosRuler` CRD. #5520\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.web.timeout` and `spec.web.getConcurrency` to the `Alertmanager` CRD. #5478\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.groups[].limit` to the `Prometheus` CRD. #4999\n* [FEATURE] Add ScrapeConfig CRD. #5335\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Set a default for `seccompProfile` on the operator and webhook Deployments to `RuntimeDefault`. #5477\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add optional liveness and readiness probes to `prometheus-config-reloader`.

As the v1alpha1 version tells it, we don't\nrecommend using it in production but we're eager to hear all possible feedback.\n\nTo try it, follow the following steps:\n1. Install the new CRD in the cluster (see\n   `example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheusagents.yaml`).\n2. Update the Prometheus operator's RBAC permissions to manage PrometheusAgents resources\n   (see `example/rbac/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator-cluster-role.yaml`).\n\n**NOTE**: if these conditions aren't met, the operator will start but it won't\nbe able to reconcile the PrometheusAgent resources.\n\nFor the first time, the container images associated to this release are signed\nusing [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/).\n\n* [CHANGE] Remove the `/apis` endpoints from the operator's web server. #5396\n* [CHANGE] Set default default value of `spec.portName` to `web`. #5350\n* [FEATURE] Add v1alpha1 `PrometheusAgent` CRD to run Prometheus in agent mode. #5385\n* [FEATURE] Add `--reload-timeout` argument to the config-reloader binary which controls how long the program will wait for the reload operation to complete (default: 30s). #5349\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Set web server's `ReadTimeout` and `ReadHeaderTimeout` to 30s for Prometheus operator and config-reloader to avoid potential slowloris attacks. #5340\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add support for `DropEqual` and `KeepEqual` relabeling actions. #5368\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Drop invalid `PrometheusRule` objects instead of failing the reconciliation of Prometheus and ThanosRuler objects. #5221\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `spec.thanos.blockSize` field to the `Prometheus` CRD. #5360\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `spec.thanos.configTimeout` and `spec.thanos.configInterval` to the Prometheus CRD. #5399\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `spec.alertmanagerConfiguration.global.slackApiUrl` field to the `Alertmanager` CRD. #5383\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `spec.alertmanagerConfiguration.global.opsGenieApiUrl` and `spec.alertmanagerConfiguration.global.opsGenieApiKey` fields to the `Alertmanager` CRD. #5422\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Reduce the operator's memory usage by using metadata informers for Kubernetes secrets and configmaps. #5424 #5448\n* [BUGFIX] Add `init-config-reloader` init container to avoid a restart of the Alertmanager's `config-reloader` container when the pod starts. #5358\n\n## 0.63.0 / 2023-02-08\n\n* [CHANGE] Use `tmpfs` to store `Prometheus` and `Alertmanager` configuration. #5311\n* [FEATURE] Add `status` subresource to the `Alertmanager` CRD. #5270\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.additionalArgs` to the `ThanosRuler` CRD. #5293\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `spec.web.maxConnections` to the `Prometheus` CRD. #5175\n* [BUGFIX] Fix unsupported types in Alertmanager route sanitizer log lines. #5296\n* [BUGFIX] Fix `ThanosRuler` StatefulSet re-creation bug when labels are specified. #5318\n\n## 0.62.0 / 2023-01-04\n\n* [CHANGE] Use `spec.version` of the Prometheus object as the image's tag if the image name is untagged. #5171\n* [FEATURE] Generate \"apply configuration\" types. #5243\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.podTargetLabels` field to the Prometheus CRD for adding pod target labels to every PodMonitor/ServiceMonitor. #5206\n* [FEATURE] Add `spec.version` field to the ThanosRuler CRD. #5177\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `basicAuth` field to the Prometheus CRD for alerting configuration of Prometheus. #5170\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `spec.imagePullPolicy` to Prometheus, Alertmanager and ThanosRuler CRDs. #5203\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `activeTimeIntervals` field to AlertmanagerConfig CRD. #5198\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Support `time_intervals` and `active_time_intervals` in the Alertmanager configurations. #5135\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Support new fields in the Alertmanager v0.25.0 configuration. #5254 #5263\n\n## 0.61.1 / 2022-11-24\n\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed a regression that caused the ThanosRuler statefulsets to be stuck after upgrading the operator to v0.61.0. #5183\n\n## 0.61.0 / 2022-11-16\n\n* [CHANGE] Updated `RuleGroup` description and add validation for the CRD. #5072\n* [CHANGE] Removed validations in the operator that are already covered at the CRD level. #5108\n* [CHANGE] jsonnet: Enforced existence of the TLS secret for the admission webhook deployment. #5112\n* [CHANGE] jsonnet: Changed default port of the admission webhook service from 8443 to 443. #5112\n* [CHANGE] Added a filter for non-running pods in the `ServiceMonitor` CRD. #5149\n* [FEATURE] Added `spec.attachMetadata.node` in the `ServiceMonitor` CRD. #5147\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated `ProbeTLSConfig` and `SafeTLSConfig` description. #5081\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated admission webhook deployment's jsonnet to avoid down-time on updates. #5099\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added the `filterExternalLabels` field to the remote read configuration of the `Prometheus` CRD. #5142\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `enableHttp2` field to `AlertingEndpoints` #5152\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Updated `ThanosRuler` arguments (`QueryConfig`, `AlertManagerConfig`, `ObjectStorageConfig` and `TracingConfig`) to be directly read from secrets instead of using ENV vars. #5122\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `alertmanagerConfigMatcherStrategy` to `Alertmanager` CRD in order to disable auto-generated namespace matchers. #5084\n* [BUGFIX] Ignore `PartialResponseStrategy` in the `Prometheus` CRD. This field is only applicable for the Thanos Ruler. #5125\n\n## 0.60.1 / 2022-10-10\n\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed configuration when `spec.tsdb.outOfOrderTimeWindow` is set in the Prometheus CRD. #5078\n\n## 0.60.0 / 2022-10-06\n\n* [CHANGE] Added `filterRunning` field to the PodMonitor CRD.

There are more details in\n`Documentation/user-guides/webhook.md` about the webhook configuration.\n\nBecause of the conversion webhook requirement, the new version is an opt-in\nfeature: the `bundle.yaml` file and the manifests from\n`example/prometheus-operator-crd` don't deploy the new API version (the\nmanifests to enable the v1beta1 version are under the\n`example/prometheus-operator-crd-full` directory). We will wait until v0.59.0\n(at least) before enabling the new API version by default.\n\n* [CHANGE] Added validations at the API level for the time-based fields of the ThanosRuler CRD. #4815\n* [CHANGE] Added validations at the API level for the OpsGenie's `responders` field of the AlertmanagerConfig CRD. #4725\n* [FEATURE] Added v1beta1 version for AlertmanagerConfig CRD. #4709\n* [FEATURE] Added support for Telegram receiver in the AlertmanagerConfig CRD. #4726\n* [FEATURE] Added `updateAlerts` field to the OpsGenie configuration of the AlertmanagerConfig CRD. #4726\n* [FEATURE] Added `hostAliases` field to the Alertmanager, Prometheus and ThanosRuler CRDs. #4787\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added configuration option in the jsonnet mixins to specify the aggregation labels. #4814\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Added `attachMetadata` field to the PodMonitor CRD. #4792\n* [BUGFIX] Fixed the curl command for exec probes when `listenLocal` is set to true in the Prometheus object.

When the path contains a full path, a volume + volume mount should be explicitly given in the Prometheus spec since the root file system is now read-only. #4566\n* [CHANGE/BUGFIX] Added skip TLS verify for the config-reloader HTTP client when informing Prometheus/Alertmanager on a config reload (partial fix for #4273). #4592\n* [CHANGE] Switched using the `endpointslice` role for Prometheus

It addresses the need for rule syntax validation and rule\nselection across namespaces. `PrometheusRule` replaces the configuration of\nPrometheus rules via K8s ConfigMaps. There are two migration paths:\n\n1. Automated live migration: If the Prometheus Operator finds Kubernetes\n   ConfigMaps that match the `RuleSelector` in a `Prometheus` specification, it\n   will convert them to matching `PrometheusRule` resources.\n\n2. Manual migration: We provide a basic CLI tool to convert Kubernetes\n   ConfigMaps to `PrometheusRule` resources.\n\n```bash\ngo get -u github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/cmd/po-rule-migration\npo-rule-migration \\\n--rule-config-map=<path-to-config-map> \\\n--rule-crds-destination=<path-to-rule-crd-destination>\n```\n\n* [FEATURE] Add leveled logging to Prometheus Operator (#1277)\n* [FEATURE] Allow additional Alertmanager configuration in Prometheus CRD (#1338)\n* [FEATURE] Introduce `PrometheusRule` Custom Resource Definition (#1333)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow Prometheus to consider all namespaces to find ServiceMonitors (#1278)\n* [BUGFIX] Do not attempt to set default memory request for Prometheus 2.0 (#1275)\n\n## 0.19.0 / 2018-04-25\n\n* [FEATURE] Allow specifying additional Prometheus scrape configs via secret (#1246)\n* [FEATURE] Enable Thanos sidecar (#1219)\n* [FEATURE] Make AM log level configurable (#1192)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Enable Prometheus to select Service Monitors outside own namespace (#1227)\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Enrich Prometheus operator CRD registration error handling (#1208)\n* [BUGFIX] Allow up to 10m for Prometheus pod on startup for data recovery (#1232)\n\n## 0.18.1 / 2018-04-09\n\n* [BUGFIX] Fix alertmanager >=0.15.0 cluster gossip communication (#1193)\n\n## 0.18.0 / 2018-03-04\n\nFrom this release onwards only Kubernetes versions v1.8 and higher are supported. If you have an older version of Kubernetes and the Prometheus Operator running, we recommend upgrading Kubernetes first and then the Prometheus Operator.\n\nWhile multiple validation issues have been fixed, it will remain a beta feature in this release. If you want to update validations, you need to either apply the CustomResourceDefinitions located in `example/prometheus-operator-crd` or delete all CRDs and restart the Prometheus Operator.\n\nSome changes cause Prometheus and Alertmanager clusters to be redeployed. If you do not have persistent storage backing your data, this means you will loose the amount of data equal to your retention time.\n\n* [CHANGE] Use canonical `/prometheus` and `/alertmanager` as data dirs in containers.\n* [FEATURE] Allow configuring Prometheus and Alertmanager servers to listen on loopback interface, allowing proxies to be the ingress point of those Pods.\n* [FEATURE] Allow configuring additional containers in Prometheus and Alertmanager Pods.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to whitelist Kubernetes labels to become Prometheus labels.\n* [FEATURE] Allow specifying additional secrets for Alertmanager Pods to mount.\n* [FEATURE] Allow specifying `bearer_token_file` for Alertmanger configurations of Prometheus objects in order to authenticate with Alertmanager.\n* [FEATURE] Allow specifying TLS configuration for Alertmanger configurations of Prometheus objects.\n* [FEATURE] Add metrics for reconciliation errors: `prometheus_operator_alertmanager_reconcile_errors_total` and `prometheus_operator_prometheus_reconcile_errors_total`.\n* [FEATURE] Support `read_recent` and `required_matchers` fields for remote read configurations.\n* [FEATURE] Allow disabling any defaults of `SecurityContext` fields of Pods.\n* [BUGFIX] Handle Alertmanager >=v0.15.0 breaking changes correctly.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix invalid validations for metric relabeling fields.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix validations for `AlertingSpec`.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix validations for deprecated storage fields.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix remote read and write basic auth support.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix properly propagate errors of Prometheus config reloader.\n\n## 0.17.0 / 2018-02-15\n\nThis release adds validations as a beta feature. It will only be installed on new clusters, existing CRD definitions will not be updated, this will be done in a future release. Please try out this feature and give us feedback!\n\n* [CHANGE] Default Prometheus version v2.2.0-rc.0.\n* [CHANGE] Default Alertmanager version v0.14.0.\n* [FEATURE] Generate and add CRD validations.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to set `serviceAccountName` for Alertmanager Pods.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to specify custom `securityContext` for Alertmanager Pods.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Default to non-root security context for Alertmanager Pods.\n\n## 0.16.1 / 2018-01-16\n\n* [CHANGE] Default to Alertmanager v0.13.0.\n* [BUGFIX] Alertmanager flags must be double dashed starting v0.13.0.\n\n## 0.16.0 / 2018-01-11\n\n* [FEATURE] Add support for specifying remote storage configurations.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to specify log level.\n* [FEATURE] Add support for dropping metrics at scrape time.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Ensure that resource limit can't make Pods unschedulable.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Allow configuring emptyDir volumes\n* [BUGFIX] Use `--storage.tsdb.no-lockfile` for Prometheus 2.0.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix Alertmanager default storage.path.\n\n## 0.15.0 / 2017-11-22\n\n* [CHANGE] Default Prometheus version v2.0.0\n* [BUGFIX] Generate ExternalLabels deterministically\n* [BUGFIX] Fix incorrect mount path of Alertmanager data volume\n* [EXPERIMENTAL] Add ability to specify CRD Kind name\n\n## 0.14.1 / 2017-11-01\n\n* [BUGFIX] Ignore illegal change of PodManagementPolicy to StatefulSet.\n\n## 0.14.0 / 2017-10-19\n\n* [CHANGE] Default Prometheus version v2.0.0-rc.1.\n* [CHANGE] Default Alertmanager version v0.9.1.\n* [BUGFIX] Set StatefulSet replicas to 0 if 0 is specified in Alertmanager/Prometheus object.\n* [BUGFIX] Glob for all files in a ConfigMap as rule files.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to run Prometheus Operator for a single namespace.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to specify CRD api group.\n* [FEATURE] Use readiness and health endpoints of Prometheus 1.8+.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add OwnerReferences to managed objects.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Use parallel pod creation strategy for Prometheus StatefulSets.\n\n## 0.13.0 / 2017-09-21\n\nAfter a long period of not having broken any functionality in the Prometheus Operator, we have decided to promote the status of this project to beta.\n\nCompatibility guarantees and migration strategies continue to be the same as for the `v0.12.0` release.\n\n* [CHANGE] Remove analytics collection.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix memory leak in kubelet endpoints sync.\n* [FEATURE] Allow setting global default `scrape_interval`.\n* [FEATURE] Allow setting Pod objectmeta to Prometheus and Alertmanger objects.\n* [FEATURE] Allow setting tolerations and affinity for Prometheus and Alertmanager objects.\n\n## 0.12.0 / 2017-08-24\n\nStarting with this release only Kubernetes `v1.7.x` and up is supported as CustomResourceDefinitions are a requirement for the Prometheus Operator and are only available from those versions and up.\n\nAdditionally all objects have been promoted from `v1alpha1` to `v1`. On start up of this version of the Prometheus Operator the previously used `ThirdPartyResource`s and the associated `v1alpha1` objects will be automatically migrated to their `v1` equivalent `CustomResourceDefinition`.\n\n* [CHANGE] All manifests created and used by the Prometheus Operator have been promoted from `v1alpha1` to `v1`.\n* [CHANGE] Use Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition`s instead of `ThirdPartyResource`s.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to set scrape timeout to `ServiceMonitor`.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Use `StatefulSet` rolling deployments.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Properly set `SecurityContext` for Prometheus 2.0 deployments.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Enable web lifecycle APIs for Prometheus 2.0 deployments.\n\n## 0.11.2 / 2017-09-21\n\n* [BUGFIX] Fix memory leak in kubelet endpoints sync.\n\n## 0.11.1 / 2017-07-28\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add profiling endpoints.\n* [BUGFIX] Adapt Alertmanager storage usage to not use deprecated storage definition.\n\n## 0.11.0 / 2017-07-20\n\nWarning: This release deprecates the previously used storage definition in favor of upstream PersistentVolumeClaim templates. While this should not have an immediate effect on a running cluster, Prometheus object definitions that have storage configured need to be adapted. The previously existing fields are still there, but have no effect anymore.\n\n* [FEATURE] Add Prometheus 2.0 alpha3 support.\n* [FEATURE] Use PVC templates instead of custom storage definition.\n* [FEATURE] Add cAdvisor port to kubelet sync.\n* [FEATURE] Allow default base images to be configurable.\n* [FEATURE] Configure Prometheus to only use necessary namespaces.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improve rollout detection for Alertmanager clusters.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix targetPort relabeling.\n\n## 0.10.2 / 2017-06-21\n\n* [BUGFIX] Use computed route prefix instead of directly from manifest.\n\n## 0.10.1 / 2017-06-13\n\nAttention: if the basic auth feature was previously used, the `key` and `name`\nfields need to be switched. This was not intentional, and the bug is not fixed,\nbut causes this change.\n\n* [CHANGE] Prometheus default version v1.7.1.\n* [CHANGE] Alertmanager default version v0.7.1.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix basic auth secret key selector `key` and `name` switched.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix route prefix flag not always being set for Prometheus.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix nil panic on replica metrics.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to specify Alertmanager path prefix for Prometheus.\n\n## 0.10.0 / 2017-06-09\n\n* [CHANGE] Prometheus route prefix defaults to root.\n* [CHANGE] Default to Prometheus v1.7.0.\n* [CHANGE] Default to Alertmanager v0.7.0.\n* [FEATURE] Add route prefix support to Alertmanager resource.\n* [FEATURE] Add metrics on expected replicas.\n* [FEATURE] Support for running Alertmanager v0.7.0.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix sensitive rollout triggering.\n\n## 0.9.1 / 2017-05-18\n\n* [FEATURE] Add experimental Prometheus 2.0 support.\n* [FEATURE] Add support for setting Prometheus external labels.\n* [BUGFIX] Fix non-deterministic config generation.\n\n## 0.9.0 / 2017-05-09\n\n* [CHANGE] The `kubelet-object` flag has been renamed to `kubelet-service`.\n* [CHANGE] Remove automatic relabelling of Pod and Service labels onto targets.\n* [CHANGE] Remove \"non-namespaced\" alpha annotation in favor of `honor_labels`.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability make use of the Prometheus `honor_labels` configuration option.\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to specify image pull secrets for Prometheus and Alertmanager pods.\n* [FEATURE] Add basic auth configuration option through ServiceMonitor.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add liveness and readiness probes to Prometheus and Alertmanger pods.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Add default resource requests for Alertmanager pods.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Fallback to ExternalIPs when InternalIPs are not available in kubelet sync.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved change detection to trigger Prometheus rollout.\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Do not delete unmanaged Prometheus configuration Secret.\n\n## 0.8.2 / 2017-04-20\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Use new Prometheus 1.6 storage flags and make it default.\n\n## 0.8.1 / 2017-04-13\n\n* [ENHANCEMENT] Include kubelet insecure port in kubelet Enpdoints object.\n\n## 0.8.0 / 2017-04-07\n\n* [FEATURE] Add ability to mount custom secrets into Prometheus Pods. Note that\n  secrets cannot be modified after creation, if the list if modified after\n  creation it will not effect the Prometheus Pods.\n* [FEATURE] Attach pod and service name as labels to Pod targets.\n\n## 0.7.0 / 2017-03-17\n\nThis release introduces breaking changes to the generated StatefulSet's\nPodTemplate, which cannot be modified for StatefulSets.

This document outlines some of the\nconventions on development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points\nand other resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.\n\nTo maintain a safe and welcoming community, all participants must adhere to the\nproject's [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).\n\n## Certificate of Origin\n\nBy contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of\nOrigin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a\nsimple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the\ncontribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.\n\n## Email and Chat\n\nThe project currently uses the [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com):\n\n- [#prometheus-operator](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CFFDS2Z7F)\n- [#prometheus-operator-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C01B03QCSMN)\n\nPlease avoid emailing maintainers found in the MAINTAINERS file directly. They\nare very busy and read the mailing lists.\n\n## Office Hours Meetings\n\nThe project also holds bi-weekly public meetings where maintainers,\ncontributors and users of the Prometheus Operator and kube-prometheus can\ndiscuss issues, pull requests or any topic related to the projects. The\nmeetings happen at 11:00 UTC on Monday, check the [online\nnotes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-fjJmzrwRpKmSPHtXN5u6VZnn39M28KqyQGBEJsqUOk/edit?usp=sharing)\nto know the exact dates and the connection details.\n\nAn invite is also available on the [project's public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1/embed?src=c_331fefe21da6f878f17e5b752d63e19d58b1e3bb24cb82e5ac65e5fd14e81878@group.calendar.google.com&csspa=1).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- Fork the repository on GitHub\n- Read the [README](README.md) for build and test instructions\n- Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!\n\n## Contribution Flow\n\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\n\n- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually `main`).\n- Make commits of logical units.\n- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).\n- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\n- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate. ([Testing guidelines](TESTING.md))\n- Submit a pull request to the original repository.\n\nMany files (documentation, manifests, ...) in this repository are auto-generated. For instance, `bundle.yaml` is generated from the *Jsonnet* files in `/jsonnet/prometheus-operator`. Before submitting a pull request, make sure that you've executed `make generate` and committed the generated changes.\n\nThanks for your contributions!\n\n### Changes to the APIs\n\nWhen designing Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), please refer to the existing Kubernetes guidelines:\n\n- [API conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md).\n- [API changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md).\n\nIn particular, this project follows the API stability guidelines:\n\n- For alpha API versions (e.g. `v1alpha1`, `v1alpha2`, ...), we may allow to break forward and backward compatibility (but we'll try hard to avoid it).\n- For beta API versions (e.g. `v1beta1`, `v1beta2`, ...), we may allow to break backward compatibility but not forward compatibility.\n- For stable API versions (e.g. `v1`), we don't allow to break backward and forward compatibility.\n\n### Format of the Commit Message\n\nWe follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two\nquestions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and\nthe body of the commit should describe the why.\n\n```bash\nscripts: add the test-cluster command\n\nThis uses tmux to setup a test cluster that you can easily kill and\nstart for debugging.\n\nFixes #38\n```\n\nThe format can be described more formally as follows:\n\n```bash\n<subsystem>: <what changed>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<why this change was made>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<footer>\n```\n\nThe first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the\nsecond line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.\nThis allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various\nGit tools.\n\n## Local Development\n\nIf you want to run Prometheus Operator on your local environment, you can follow the steps below.\n\n1. First start a Kubernetes cluster. We recommend [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) because it is lightweight (it can run on small notebooks) and this is what the project's CI uses. [MiniKube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) is also another option.\n\n2. Run the utility script [scripts/run-external.sh](scripts/run-external.sh), it will check all the requirements and run your local version of the Prometheus Operator on your Kind cluster.\n\n```bash\n./scripts/run-external.sh -c\n```\n\n3. You should now be able to see the logs from the operator in your terminal. The Operator is successully running in your local system and can be debugged, checked for behaviour etc.\n\nSimilarly, if you work on a specific branch, you can run the `scripts/run-external.sh` script in this branch to deploy it.\n\n## Proposal Process\n\nThe Prometheus Operator project accepts proposals for new features,\nenhancements and design documents. The document should be created in the\n`Documentation/proposals` directory using the template below, prefixed by\n`<YEAR><MONTH>-` and submitted in the form of a GitHub Pull Request.\n\nThe process is adopted from the Thanos community.\n\n```markdown mdox-exec=\"cat Documentation/proposals/template.md\"\n## Your Proposal Title\n\n* **Owners:**\n  * `<@author: single champion for the moment of writing>`\n\n* **Related Tickets:**\n  * `<JIRA, GH Issues>`\n\n* **Other docs:**\n  * `<Links…>`\n\n> TL;DR: Give a summary of what this document is proposing and what components it is touching.\n>\n> *For example: This design doc is proposing a consistent design template for “example.com” organization.*\n\n## Why\n\nProvide a motivation behind the change proposed by this design document, give context.\n\n*For example: It’s important to clearly explain the reasons behind certain design decisions in order to have a\nconsensus between team members, as well as external stakeholders.\nSuch a design document can also be used as a reference and for knowledge-sharing purposes.\nThat’s why we are proposing a consistent style of the design document that will be used for future designs.*\n\n### Pitfalls of the current solution\n\nWhat specific problems are we hitting with the current solution? Why is it not enough?\n\n*For example: We were missing a consistent design doc template, so each team/person was creating their own.\nBecause of inconsistencies, those documents were harder to understand, and it was easy to miss important sections.\nThis was causing certain engineering time to be wasted.*\n\n## Goals\n\nGoals and use cases for the solution as proposed in [How](#how):\n\n* Allow easy collaboration and decision making on design ideas.\n* Have a consistent design style that is readable and understandable.\n* Have a design style that is concise and covers all the essential information.\n\n### Audience\n\nIf this is not clear already, provide the target audience for this change.\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n* Move old designs to the new format.\n* Not doing X,Y,Z.\n\n## How\n\nExplain the full overview of the proposed solution. Some guidelines:\n\n* Make it concise and **simple**; put diagrams; be concrete, avoid using “really”, “amazing” and “great” (:\n* How will you test and verify?\n* How will you migrate users, without downtime. How do we solve incompatibilities?\n* What open questions are left? (“Known unknowns”)\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThis section should state potential alternatives.\nHighlight the objections the reader should have towards your proposal as they read it.\nTell them why you still think you should take this path.\n\n1.

The purpose of this project is to\nsimplify and automate the configuration of a Prometheus based monitoring stack for Kubernetes clusters.\n\nThe Prometheus operator includes, but is not limited to, the following features:\n\n* **Kubernetes Custom Resources**: Use Kubernetes custom resources to deploy and manage Prometheus, Alertmanager,\n  and related components.\n\n* **Simplified Deployment Configuration**: Configure the fundamentals of Prometheus like versions, persistence,\n  retention policies, and replicas from a native Kubernetes resource.\n\n* **Prometheus Target Configuration**: Automatically generate monitoring target configurations based\n  on familiar Kubernetes label queries; no need to learn a Prometheus specific configuration language.\n\nFor an introduction to the Prometheus Operator, see the [getting started](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/developer/getting-started.md) guide.\n\n## Project Status\n\nThe operator in itself is considered to be production ready. Please refer to the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) versions for the status of each CRD:\n\n* `monitoring.coreos.com/v1`: **stable** CRDs and API, changes are made in a backward-compatible way.\n* `monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1`: **unstable** CRDs and API, changes can happen but the team is focused on avoiding them. We encourage usage in production for users that accept the risk of breaking changes.\n* `monitoring.coreos.com/v1alpha1`: **unstable** CRDs and API, changes can happen frequently, and we suggest avoiding its usage on mission-critical environments.\n\n## Prometheus Operator vs. kube-prometheus vs. community Helm chart\n\n### Prometheus Operator\n\nThe Prometheus Operator uses Kubernetes [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) to simplify the deployment and configuration of Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related monitoring components.\n\n### kube-prometheus\n\n[kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) provides example configurations for a complete cluster monitoring\nstack based on Prometheus and the Prometheus Operator. This includes deployment of multiple Prometheus and Alertmanager instances,\nmetrics exporters such as the node_exporter for gathering node metrics, scrape target configuration linking Prometheus to various\nmetrics endpoints, and example alerting rules for notification of potential issues in the cluster.\n\n### Helm chart\n\nThe [prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)\nHelm chart provides a similar feature set to kube-prometheus. This chart is maintained by the Prometheus community.\nFor more information, please see the [chart's readme](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack#kube-prometheus-stack)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThe Prometheus Operator requires at least Kubernetes version `1.16.0`. If you\nare just starting out with the Prometheus Operator, it is highly recommended to\nuse the latest [stable\nrelease](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/releases/latest).\n\n## CustomResourceDefinitions\n\nA core feature of the Prometheus Operator is to monitor the Kubernetes API server for changes\nto specific objects and ensure that the current Prometheus deployments match these objects.\nThe Operator acts on the following [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/):\n\n* **`Prometheus`**, which defines a desired Prometheus deployment.\n\n* **`PrometheusAgent`**, which defines a desired Prometheus deployment, but running in Agent mode.\n\n* **`Alertmanager`**, which defines a desired Alertmanager deployment.\n\n* **`ThanosRuler`**, which defines a desired Thanos Ruler deployment.\n\n* **`ServiceMonitor`**, which declaratively specifies how groups of Kubernetes services should be monitored.\n  The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.\n\n* **`PodMonitor`**, which declaratively specifies how group of pods should be monitored.\n  The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration based on the current state of the objects in the API server.\n\n* **`Probe`**, which declaratively specifies how groups\n  of ingresses or static targets should be monitored. The Operator automatically generates Prometheus scrape configuration\n  based on the definition.\n\n* **`ScrapeConfig`**, which declaratively specifies scrape configurations to be added to Prometheus. This CustomResourceDefinition helps with scraping resources outside the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n* **`PrometheusRule`**, which defines a desired set of Prometheus alerting and/or recording rules.\n  The Operator generates a rule file, which can be used by Prometheus instances.\n\n* **`AlertmanagerConfig`**, which declaratively specifies subsections of the Alertmanager configuration, allowing\n  routing of alerts to custom receivers, and setting inhibit rules.\n\nThe Prometheus operator automatically detects changes in the Kubernetes API server to any of the above objects, and ensures that\nmatching deployments and configurations are kept in sync.\n\nTo learn more about the CRDs introduced by the Prometheus Operator have a look\nat the [design](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/getting-started/design/) page.\n\n## Dynamic Admission Control\n\nTo prevent invalid Prometheus alerting and recording rules from causing failures in a deployed Prometheus instance,\nan [admission webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/)\nis provided to validate `PrometheusRule` resources upon initial creation or update.\n\nFor more information on this feature, see the [user guide](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/platform/webhook/).\n\n## Quickstart\n\n**Note:** this quickstart does not provision an entire monitoring stack; if that is what you are looking for,\nsee the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) project. If you want the whole stack,\nbut have already applied the `bundle.yaml`, delete the bundle first (`kubectl delete -f bundle.yaml`).\n\nTo quickly try out *just* the Prometheus Operator inside a cluster, **choose a release** and run the following command which deploys the operator in the `default` namespace:\n\n```sh\nkubectl create -f bundle.yaml\n```\n\nIf you want to deploy the Prometheus operator in a different namespace, you also need `kustomize`:\n\n```sh\nNAMESPACE=my_namespace kustomize edit set namespace $NAMESPACE && kubectl create -k .\n```\n\n> Note: make sure to adapt the namespace in the ClusterRoleBinding if deploying in a namespace other than the default namespace.\n\nTo run the Operator outside of a cluster:\n\n```sh\nmake\nscripts/run-external.sh <kubectl cluster name>\n```\n\n## Removal\n\nTo remove the operator and Prometheus, first delete any custom resources you created in each namespace. The\noperator will automatically shut down and remove Prometheus and Alertmanager pods, and associated ConfigMaps.\n\n```sh\nfor n in $(kubectl get namespaces -o jsonpath={..metadata.name}); do\n  kubectl delete --all --namespace=$n prometheus,servicemonitor,podmonitor,alertmanager\ndone\n```\n\nAfter a couple of minutes you can go ahead and remove the operator itself.\n\n```sh\nkubectl delete -f bundle.yaml\n```\n\nThe operator automatically creates services in each namespace where you created a Prometheus or Alertmanager resources,\nand defines three custom resource definitions. You can clean these up now.\n\n```sh\nfor n in $(kubectl get namespaces -o jsonpath={..metadata.name}); do\n  kubectl delete --ignore-not-found --namespace=$n service prometheus-operated alertmanager-operated\ndone\n\nkubectl delete --ignore-not-found customresourcedefinitions \\\n  prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com \\\n  servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com \\\n  podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com \\\n  alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com \\\n  prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com \\\n  alertmanagerconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com \\\n  scrapeconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nSee [TESTING](TESTING.md)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Security\n\nIf you find a security vulnerability related to the Prometheus Operator, please\ndo not report it by opening a GitHub issue, but instead please send an e-mail to\nthe maintainers of the project found in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCheck the [troubleshooting documentation](Documentation/platform/troubleshooting.md) for\ncommon issues and frequently asked questions (FAQ).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nprometheus-operator organization logo was created and contributed by [Bianca Cheng Costanzo](https://github.com/bia).\n"

Some preparations should be done a few days in advance.\n\n* We aim to keep the main branch in a working state at all times. In principle, it should be possible to cut a release from main at any time. In practice, things might not work out as nicely. A few days before the release is scheduled, the shepherd should check the state of main. Following their best judgement, the shepherd should try to expedite features/bug fixes that are still in progress but should make it into the release. On the other hand, the shepherd may hold back merging last-minute invasive and risky changes that are better suited for the next major release.\n* On the date listed in the table above, the release shepherd cuts the release and creates a new branch called `release-<major>.<minor>` starting at the commit tagged for the release.\n* If regressions or critical bugs are detected, they need to get fixed before cutting a new release.\n\nSee the next section for details on cutting an individual release.\n\n## How to cut a new release\n\n> This guide is strongly based on the [Prometheus release instructions](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/RELEASE.md).\n\n## Branch management and versioning strategy\n\nWe use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).\n\nWe maintain a separate branch for each minor release, named `release-<major>.<minor>`, e.g. `release-1.1`, `release-2.0`.\n\nThe usual flow is to merge new features and changes into the `main` branch and to merge bug fixes into the latest release branch. Bug fixes are then merged into `main` from the latest release branch. The `main` branch should always contain all commits from the latest release branch.\n\nIf a bug fix got accidentally merged into `main`, cherry-pick commits have to be created in the latest release branch, which then have to be merged back into `main`. Try to avoid that situation.\n\nMaintaining the release branches for older minor releases happens on a best effort basis.\n\n## Update Go dependencies\n\nA couple of days before the release, consider submitting a PR against the `main` branch to update the Go dependencies.\n\n```bash\nmake update-go-deps\nmake tidy\n```\n\n## Update operand versions\n\nA couple of days before the release, update the [default versions](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/f6ce472ecd6064fb6769e306b55b149dfb6af903/pkg/operator/defaults.go#L20-L31) of Prometheus, Alertmanager and Thanos if newer versions are available.\n\n## Prepare your release\n\nFor a new major or minor release, work from the `main` branch. For a patch release, work in the branch of the minor release you want to patch (e.g. `release-0.43` if you're releasing `v0.43.2`).\n\nBump the version in the `VERSION` file in the root of the repository.\n\nA number of files have to be re-generated, this is automated with the following make target:\n\n```bash\nmake clean generate\n```\n\nBump the version of the `pkg/apis/monitoring` and `pkg/client` packages in `go.mod`:\n\n```bash\ngo mod edit -require \"github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkg/apis/monitoring@v$(< VERSION)\" pkg/client/go.mod\ngo mod edit -require \"github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkg/apis/monitoring@v$(< VERSION)\"\ngo mod edit -require \"github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkg/client@v$(< VERSION)\"\n```\n\nNow that all version information has been updated, an entry for the new version can be added to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.\n\nNote that CHANGELOG.md should only document changes relevant to users of prometheus-operator, including external API changes, performance improvements, and new features. Do not document changes of internal interfaces, code refactoring and clean-ups, doc changes and changes to the build process, etc.\n\nEntries in the `CHANGELOG.md` are meant to be in this order:\n\n* `[CHANGE]`\n* `[FEATURE]`\n* `[ENHANCEMENT]`\n* `[BUGFIX]`\n\nCreate a PR for the changes to be reviewed.\n\nYou can use the GitHub UI to see the difference between the release branch and the latest stable release.\n\nFor example: https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/compare/v0.72.0...release-0.73\n\nUnless exception, the latest tag shouldn't contain commits that don't exist in the release branch.\n\n## Publish the new release\n\nFor new minor and major releases, create the `release-<major>.<minor>` branch starting at the PR merge commit.\nPush the branch to the remote repository with\n\n**Note:** The remote name `origin` is assumed to be pointed to `github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator`. If you have a different remote name, use that instead of `origin`. Verify this using `git remote -v`.\n\n```bash\ngit push origin release-<major>.<minor>\n```\n\nYou could also create the release branch directly from Github UI as well if the current main branch HEAD is what release branch should be based on.\n\nFrom now on, all work happens on the `release-<major>.<minor>` branch.\n\nTag the new release with a tag named `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, e.g. `v2.1.3`. Note the `v` prefix. Tag also the `github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkg/apis/monitoring` module with `pkg/apis/monitoring/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and the `github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkg/client` module with `pkg/client/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. You can do the tagging on the commandline:\n\n```bash\ntag=\"v$(< VERSION)\"\ngit tag -s \"${tag}\" -m \"${tag}\"\ngit tag -s \"pkg/apis/monitoring/${tag}\" -m \"pkg/apis/monitoring/${tag}\"\ngit tag -s \"pkg/client/${tag}\" -m \"pkg/client/${tag}\"\ngit push origin \"${tag}\" \"pkg/apis/monitoring/${tag}\" \"pkg/client/${tag}\"\n```\n\nSigned tag with a GPG key is appreciated, but in case you can't add a GPG key to your Github account using the following [procedure](https://docs.github.com/articles/generating-a-gpg-key), you can replace the `-s` flag by `-a` flag of the `git tag` command to only annotate the tag without signing.\n\nOnce a tag is created, the `publish` Github action will push the container images to [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/prometheus-operator) and [ghcr.io](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/pkgs/container/prometheus-operator). Wait until the [publish](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/actions/workflows/publish.yaml) workflow is complete before going to the next step.\n\nWe have observed in the past that if we create a draft release and publish it later assets are not attached correctly hence its advised to wait till all workflow jobs (at least the publish job) are completed to create the release.\n\nGo to https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/releases/new, associate the new release with the before pushed tag, paste in changes made to `CHANGELOG.md` and click \"Publish release\".\n\nOnce release is published, [release job](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/actions/workflows/release.yaml) will be triggered to upload assets to the newly created release.\n\nFor patch releases, submit a pull request to merge back the release branch into the `main` branch.\n\n## Update website\n\nBump the operator's version in the [website](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/website/blob/main/data/prometheusOperator.json) repository.\n\nTake a breath. You're done releasing.\n"

Among an extensive list of benefits that tests brings to the Project's overall health and reliability, it can be the reviewer's and contributors's best friend during development:\n\n* Test cases serve as documentation, providing insights into the expected behavior of the software.\n* Testing can prevent regressions by verifying that new changes don't break existing functionality.\n* Running tests locally accelerate the feedback loop, removing the dependency that contributors might have on CI when working on a Pull Request.\n\nThis document will focus on teaching you about the different test suites that we currently have and how to run different scenarios to help your development experience!\n\n# Test categories\n\n## Unit tests\n\nUnit tests are used to test particular code snippets in isolation. They are your best ally when looking for quick feedback loops in a particular function.\n\nImagine you're working on a PR that adds a new field to the ScrapeConfig CRD and you want to test if your change is reflected to the configmap. Instead of creating a full Kubernetes cluster, installing all the CRDs, running the Prometheus-Operator, deploying a Prometheus resource with ScrapeConfigSelectors and finally check if your change made it to the live object, you could simply write or extend a unit test for the configmap generation.\n\nHere is an example test that checks if the string generated from ScrapeConfigs are equal to an expected file.\n\nhttps://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/cb534214415beb3c39353988ae85f2bb07f245e7/pkg/prometheus/promcfg_test.go#L4945-L4956\n\nUnit tests can be run with:\n\n```bash\nmake test-unit\n```\n\nThey can also be run for particular packages:\n\n```\ngo test ./pkg/prometheus/server\n```\n\nOr even particular functions:\n\n```\ngo test -run ^TestPodLabelsAnnotations$ ./pkg/prometheus/server\n```\n\n### Testing multi line string comparison - Golden files\n\nGolden files are plain-text documents designed to facilitate the validation of lengthy strings. They come in handy when, for instance, you need to test a Prometheus configuration that's generated using Go structures. You can marshal this configuration into YAML and then compare it against a static reference to ensure a match. Golden files offer an elegant solution to this challenge, sparing you the need to hard-code the static configuration directly into your test code.\n\nIn the example below, we're generating the Prometheus configuration (which can easily have 100+ lines for each individual test) and comparing it against a golden file:\n\nhttps://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/aeceb0b4fadc8307a44dc55afdceca0bea50bbb0/pkg/prometheus/promcfg_test.go#L102-L277\n\nIf not for golden files, the test above, instead of ~150 lines, would easily require around ~1000 lines. The usage of golden files help us maintain test suites with several multi line strings comparison without sacrificing test readability.\n\n### Updating Golden Files\n\nThere are contributions, e.g. adding a new required field to an existing configuration, that require to update several golden files at once. This can easily be done with the command below:\n\n```\nmake test-unit-update-golden\n```\n\n## End-to-end tests\n\nSometimes, running tests in isolation is not enough and we really want test the behavior of Prometheus-Operator when running in a working Kubernetes cluster. For those occasions, end-to-end tests are our choice.\n\nTo run e2e-tests locally, first start a Kubernetes cluster. We recommend [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) because it is lightweight (it can run on small notebooks) and this is what the project's CI uses. [MiniKube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) is also another option.\n\nFor manual testing, you can use the utility script [scripts/run-external.sh](scripts/run-external.sh), it will check all the requirements and run your local version of the Prometheus Operator on your Kind cluster:\n\n```shell\n./scripts/run-external.sh -c\n```\n\n### Building images and loading them into your cluster\n\n#### Using docker with Kind\n\nBefore running automated end-to-end tests, you need run the following command to make images and load it in your local cluster:\n\n```shell\nKIND_CONTEXT=e2e make test-e2e-images\n```\n\n#### Using podman with Kind\n\nWhen running kind on MacOS using podman, it is recommended to create podman machine with `4` CPUs and `8 GiB` memory. Less resources might cause end to end tests to fail because of lack of resources in the cluster.\n\n```shell\npodman machine init --cpus=4 --memory=8192 --rootful --now\n```\n\nBefore running automated end-to-end tests, you need run the following command to make images and load it in your local cluster:\n\n```shell\nCONTAINER_CLI=podman KIND_CONTEXT=e2e make test-e2e-images\n```\n\n### Running the automated E2E Tests\n\nTo run the automated end-to-end tests, run the following command:\n\n```shell\nmake test-e2e\n```\n\n`make test-e2e` will run the complete end-to-end test suite. Those are the same tests we run in Pull Requests pipelines and it will make sure all features requirements amongst ***all*** controllers are working.\n\nWhen working on a contribution though, it's rare that you'll need to make a change that impacts all controllers at once. Running the complete test suite takes a ***long time***, so you might want to run only the tests that are relevant to your change while developing it.\n\n### Skipping test suites\n\nhttps://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/272df8a2411bcf877107b3251e79ae8aa8c24761/test/e2e/main_test.go#L46-L50\n\nAs shown above, particular test suites can be skipped with Environment Variables. You can also look at our [CI pipeline as example](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/272df8a2411bcf877107b3251e79ae8aa8c24761/.github/workflows/e2e.yaml#L85-L94). Although we always run all tests in CI, skipping irrelevant tests are great during development as they shorten the feedback loop.\n\nThe following Makefile targets can run specific end-to-end tests:\n\n* `make test-e2e-alertmanager` - Will run Alertmanager tests.\n* `make test-e2e-thanos-ruler` - Will run Thanos-Ruler tests.\n* `make test-e2e-prometheus` - Will run Prometheus tests with limited namespace permissions.\n* `make test-e2e-prometheus-all-namespaces` - Will run regular Prometheus tests.\n* `make test-e2e-operator-upgrade` - Will validate that a monitoring stack managed by the previous version of Prometheus-Operator will continue to work after an upgrade to the current version.\n* `make test-e2e-prometheus-upgrade` - Will validate that a series of Prometheus versions can be sequentially upgraded.\n* `make test-e2e-feature-gates` - Will validate the features behind a gate.\n\n### Running only one end-to-end test\n\nThe test suites can easily take some dozens of minutes, even when running on your top-notch laptop. If you're debugging a particular test, it might be advantageous to run only this specific test. For example, the following command will only run the `TestPrometheusRuleCRDValidation/valid-rule-names` sub-test:\n\n```shell\nTEST_RUN_ARGS=\"-run TestPrometheusRuleCRDValidation/valid-rule-names\" make test-e2e-prometheus\n```\n"

          "content": "# Governance\n\nThis document describes the rules and governance of the project. It is a slightly modified version of the [Prometheus Governance](https://prometheus.io/governance/#governance-changes).\n\nIt is meant to be followed by all the developers of the Prometheus Operator project and the Prometheus Operator community. Common terminology used in this governance document are listed below:\n\n* **Maintainers Team**: Contributors who have the `Owner` role on the [prometheus-operator organization](https://github.com/prometheus-operator) and all projects within it. Members are listed in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file.\n\n* **Triage Team**: Contributors who have the `Member` role and `Triage` GitHub permission on the [prometheus-operator organization](https://github.com/prometheus-operator) and all projects within it, allowing them to modify GitHub issues and PRs statuses and labels. Triage members are listed in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md#triage) file.\n\n* **The Prometheus Operator project**: The sum of all activities performed under the [prometheus-operator organization](https://github.com/prometheus-operator), concerning one or more repositories or the community.\n\nBoth Triage and Maintainers are part of the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team).\n\n## Values\n\nThe Prometheus Operator developers and community are expected to follow the values defined in the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).\n\nFurthermore, the Prometheus Operator community strives for kindness, giving feedback effectively, and building a welcoming environment. The Prometheus Operator developers generally decide by consensus and only resort to conflict resolution by a majority vote if consensus cannot be reached.\n\n## Decision making\n\n### Maintainers Team\n\nTeam member status may be given to those who have made ongoing contributions to the Prometheus Operator project for at least 3 months.\nThis is usually in the form of code improvements, pull-request reviews, issue triaging or notable work on documentation, but organizing events or user support could also be taken into account.\n\nNew members may be proposed by any existing Maintainer by email to the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team). It is highly desirable to reach consensus about acceptance of a new member.\nHowever, the proposal is ultimately voted on by a formal [supermajority vote](#supermajority-vote) of Team Maintainers.\n\nIf the new member proposal is accepted, the proposed team member should be contacted privately via email to confirm or deny their acceptance of team membership.\nThis email will also be CC'd to the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team) for record-keeping purposes.\n\nIf they choose to accept, the following steps are taken:\n\n* The new maintainer is added to the [prometheus-operator organization](https://github.com/prometheus-operator) with the `Owner` role.\n* The new maintainer is added to the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team).\n* The new maintainer is added to the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file.\n* The new maintainer is announced on the [Prometheus Operator Twitter](https://twitter.com/PromOperator) by an existing team member.\n\nTeam members may retire at any time by emailing the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team).\n\nTeam members can be removed by [supermajority vote](#supermajority-vote) on the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team). For this vote, the member in question is not eligible to vote and does not count towards the quorum.\n\nUpon death of a member, their team membership ends automatically.\n\n### Triage Team\n\nTriage team has similar rules, however the contributions made to the projects does not need to be as significant as expected from a maintainer.\n\nNew members may be proposed by any existing Maintainer or Triage person by email to the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team). It is highly desirable to reach consensus about acceptance of a new member.\nHowever, the proposal is ultimately voted on by a formal [majority vote](#majority-vote) (in comparison to Maintainer's vote which requires a supermajority vote).\n\nIf the new member proposal is accepted, the proposed team member should be contacted privately via email to confirm or deny their acceptance of team membership.\nThis email will also be CC'd to the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team) for record-keeping purposes.\n\nIf they choose to accept, the following steps are taken:\n\n* The new triage team member is added to the [Prometheus Operator project](http://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) with `Member` role and `Triage` permission.\n* The new triage team member is added to the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team).\n* The new triage team member is added to the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file under the Triage section.\n* The new triage team member is announced on the [Prometheus Operator Twitter](https://twitter.com/PromOperator) by an existing team member.\n\nTriage member may retire at any time by emailing the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team).\n\nTriage member can be removed by [majority vote](#majority-vote) on the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team). Only the [Maintainers team members](#maintainers-team) have right to vote.\n\nUpon death of a member, their Triage team membership ends automatically.\n\n### Technical decisions\n\nSmaller technical decisions are made informally and [lazy consensus](#consensus) is assumed. Technical decisions that span multiple parts of the Prometheus Operator project\nshould be discussed and made on the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues) and in most cases followed by proposal as described [here](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nDecisions are usually made by [lazy consensus](#consensus). If no consensus can be reached, the matter may be resolved by [majority vote](#majority-vote).\n\n### Governance changes\n\nMaterial changes to this document are discussed publicly on the [Prometheus Operator GitHub](http://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator).\nAny change requires a [supermajority](#supermajority-vote) in favor. Editorial changes may be made by [lazy consensus](#consensus) unless challenged.\n\n### Other matters\n\nAny matter that needs a decision, including but not limited to financial matters, may be called to a vote by any Maintainer if they deem it necessary.\nFor financial, private, or personnel matters, discussion and voting takes place on the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team). Otherwise discussion and votes are held in public on the GitHub issues or #prometheus-operator-dev Kubernetes slack channel.\n\n## Voting\n\nThe Prometheus Operator project usually runs by informal consensus, however sometimes a formal decision must be made.\n\nDepending on the subject matter, as laid out [above](#decision-making), different methods of voting are used.\n\nFor all votes, voting must be open for at least one week. The end date should be clearly stated in the call to vote.\nA vote may be called and closed early if enough votes have come in one way so that further votes cannot change the final decision.\n\nIn all cases, all and only [Maintainers team members](#maintainers-team) are eligible to vote, with the sole exception of the forced removal of a team member, in which said member is not eligible to vote.\n\nDiscussion and votes on personnel matters (including but not limited to team membership and maintainership) are held in private on the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team). All other discussion and votes are held in public on the GitHub issues or #prometheus-operator-dev CNCF slack channel.\n\nFor public discussions, anyone interested is encouraged to participate. Formal power to object or vote is limited to [Maintainers team members](#maintainers-team).\n\n### Governance\n\nIt's important for the project to stay independent and focused on shared interest instead of single use case of one company or organization.\n\nWe value open source values and freedom, that's why we limit Maintainers Team **votes to maximum two from a single organization or company.**\n\nWe also encourage any other company interested in helping maintaining Prometheus Operator to join us to make sure we stay independent.\n\n### Consensus\n\nThe default decision making mechanism for the Prometheus Operator project is [lazy consensus](https://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#lazy). This means that any decision on technical issues is considered supported by the [Maintainers team members](#maintainers-team) as long as nobody objects.\n\nSilence on any consensus decision is implicit agreement and equivalent to explicit agreement. Explicit agreement may be stated at will.\n\nConsensus decisions can never override or go against the spirit of an earlier explicit vote.\n\nIf any of the [Maintainers team members](#maintainers-team) raises objections, the team members work together towards a solution that all involved can accept.\nThis solution is again subject to lazy consensus.\n\nIn case no consensus can be found, but a decision one way or the other must be made, [Maintainers team members](#maintainers-team) may call a formal [majority vote](#majority-vote).\n\n### Majority vote\n\nMajority votes must be called explicitly in a separate thread on the appropriate mailing list. The subject must be prefixed with `[VOTE]`.\nIn the body, the call to vote must state the proposal being voted on. It should reference any discussion leading up to this point.\n\nVotes may take the form of a single proposal, with the option to vote yes or no, or the form of multiple alternatives.\n\nA vote on a single proposal is considered successful if more vote in favor than against.\n\nIf there are multiple alternatives, members may vote for one or more alternatives, or vote “no” to object to all alternatives.\nIt is not possible to cast an “abstain” vote. A vote on multiple alternatives is considered decided in favor of one alternative if it has received the most votes in favor, and a vote from more than half of those voting. Should no alternative reach this quorum, another vote on a reduced number of options may be called separately.\n\n### Supermajority vote\n\nSupermajority votes must be called explicitly in a separate thread on the appropriate mailing list.\nThe subject must be prefixed with `[VOTE]`. In the body, the call to vote must state the proposal being voted on. It should reference any discussion leading up to this point.\n\nVotes may take the form of a single proposal, with the option to vote yes or no, or the form of multiple alternatives.\n\nA vote on a single proposal is considered successful if at least two thirds of those eligible to vote vote in favor.\n\nIf there are multiple alternatives, members may vote for one or more alternatives, or vote “no” to object to all alternatives.\nA vote on multiple alternatives is considered decided in favor of one alternative if it has received the most votes in favor, and a vote from at least two thirds of those eligible to vote. Should no alternative reach this quorum, another vote on a reduced number of options may be called separately.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThis section is informational. In case of disagreement, the rules above overrule any FAQ.\n\n### For a majority vote, what if there is an even number of maintainers and an equal amount of votes in favor than against?\n\nIt has to be the majority so the vote will be declined.\n\n### So what's the TLDR difference between majority vs supermajority?\n\nIt's about number of up votes to agree on the decision.\n\n* majority: the majority of voters have to agree.\n* supermajority: 2/3 of the voters have to agree.\n\n### How do I propose a decision?\n\nSee the [Contributing guide](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### How do I become a team member?\n\nTo become an official member of the [Maintainers Team](#maintainers-team), you should make ongoing contributions to one or more project(s) for at least three months.\nAt that point, a team member (typically a maintainer of the project) may propose you for membership.\nThe discussion about this will be held in private, and you will be informed privately when a decision has been made. A possible, but not required, graduation path is to become a triage member first.\n\nShould the decision be in favor, your new membership will also be announced on the [Prometheus Operator Twitter](https://twitter.com/PromOperator)\n\n### How do I add a project?\n\nAs a team member, propose the new project on the [Prometheus Operator GitHub Issue](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues). However, currently to maintain a project in our organization, you have to become a [Maintainers Team](#maintainers-team) member.\n\n### How do I remove a Maintainer or Triage member?\n\nAll members may resign by notifying the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team). If you think a team member should be removed against their will, propose this to the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team).\nDiscussions will be held there in private.\n\n### Can majority/supermajority vote be done on GitHub PR by just approving PR?\n\nNo, an email with the `[VOTE]` prefix has to be sent to the [prometheus-operator mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-operator-team).\n\n### What if during majority/supermajority vote there is no answer after 1 week?\n\nFor majority voting, all members that didn't reply explicitly are assumed to agree with the proposal.\n\nFor supermajority voting, the team has to wait for the replies from all members.\n"
