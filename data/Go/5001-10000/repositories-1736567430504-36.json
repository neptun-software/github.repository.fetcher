[v1.23.1](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.23.1) (2024-08-13)\n\n### Fixed Bugs 🐛\n\n- Fix building with `go build -trimpath` by @AlekSi in https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/pull/4526\n\n[All closed issues and pull requests](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/milestone/67?closed=1).\n[All commits](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/compare/v1.23.0...v1.23.1).\n\n## [v1.23.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.23.0) (2024-07-25)\n\n### What's Changed\n\n#### Embeddable package\n\nThis release switches from the [`zap` logging package](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) to the standard [`slog`](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog).\nIf the logger was configured by Go programs that import [`github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb), they should configure the `SLogger` field instead.\nSetting the old `Logger` field will make the program panic and make the issue immediately noticeable.\n\nThe next release will completely remove `zap` and rename `SLogger` to just `Logger`.\n\n#### Initial OpenTelemetry tracing support\n\nThis release adds initial support for sending OpenTelemetry traces to the OTLP endpoint.\nThe set of spans and their attributes is not stable yet and will change over time.\n\nAll improvements in observability in this release (OpenTelemetry traces, Kubernetes probes, debug archive)\nare documented [there](https://docs.ferretdb.io/configuration/observability/).\n\n#### Experimental Systemd configuration in `.deb` and `.rpm` packages\n\nThis release adds initial unit files for `systemd` that auto-start FerretDB.\nThey are likely to change in the future in incompatible ways; for example, we may switch to using a non-root user.\n\n### New Features 🎉\n\n- Add Kubernetes liveness probe by @noisersup in https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/pull/4378\n- Add Kubernetes readiness probe by @noisersup in https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/pull/4426\n- Implement Docker healthcheck by

          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThank you for your interest in making FerretDB better!\n\n## Finding something to work on\n\nWe are interested in all contributions, big or small, in code or documentation.\nBut unless you are fixing a tiny issue like a typo,\nwe kindly ask you first to [create an issue](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/issues/new/choose)\nor leave a comment on an existing issue if you want to work on it.\nThis way, we could assign the issue to you, marking it as being worked on,\npreventing others from wasting efforts working on it at the same time.\nAdditionally, you can [join our Slack chat](./README.md#community) and leave a message for us in the `#dev` channel.\n\nYou can find a list of good first issues for contributors [there](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/contribute).\nOnce you have some experience with contributing to FerretDB,\nfeel free to pick any issue\n[that is not assigned to anyone and doesn't have `not ready` label](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee+-label%3A%22not+ready%22).\nStill, please leave a comment on it as described above.\n\n## Setting up the environment\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe supported way of contributing to FerretDB is to modify and run it on the host (Linux, macOS, or Windows)\nwith PostgreSQL and other dependencies running inside Docker containers via Docker Compose.\nOn Linux, `docker` (with `docker compose` subcommand a.k.a. [Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-v2/),\nnot old `docker-compose` tool) should be installed on the host.\nOn macOS and Windows, [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) should be used.\nOn Windows, it should be [configured to use WSL 2](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) without any distro;\nall commands should be run on the host.\n\nYou will need Go 1.22 or later on the host.\nIf your package manager doesn't provide it yet,\nplease install it from [go.dev](https://go.dev/dl/).\n\nYou will also need `git` installed; the version provided by your package manager should do.\nOn Windows, the simplest way to install it might be https://gitforwindows.org.\n\nFinally, you will also need [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com) installed and configured (`git lfs install`).\n\n### Making a working copy\n\nFork the [FerretDB repository on GitHub](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/fork).\nAfter that, you can clone the repository and add the upstream repository as a remote:\n\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/FerretDB.git\ncd FerretDB\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB.git\ngit fetch --all --tags\n```\n\nThe last command would fetch all Git tags from our repository that GitHub won't copy to fork by default.\n`git describe` command uses them to determine the FerretDB version during the build process.\n\nTo run development commands, you should first install the [`task`](https://taskfile.dev/) tool.\nYou can do this by changing the directory to `tools` (`cd tools`) and running `go generate -x`.\nThat will install `task` into the `bin` directory (`bin/task` on Linux and macOS, `bin\\task.exe` on Windows).\nYou can then add `./bin` to `$PATH` either manually (`export PATH=./bin:$PATH` in `bash`)\nor using something like [`direnv` (`.envrc` files)](https://direnv.net),\nor replace every invocation of `task` with explicit `bin/task`.\nYou can also [install `task` globally](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation),\nbut that might lead to the version skew.\n\nWith `task` installed,\nyou can see all available tasks by running `task -l` in the root of the repository\n(not in the `tools` directory).\n\nAfter that, you should install development tools with `task init`\nand download required Docker images with `task env-pull`.\n\nIf something does not work correctly,\nyou can reset the environment with `task env-reset`.\n\n### Building a production release binaries\n\nTo build a production release binaries, run `task build-production`.\nThe results will be saved `tmp/bin`.\n\n### Setting a GITHUB_TOKEN\n\nSome of our development tools require access to public information on GitHub\nat a rate higher than allowed for unauthenticated requests.\nThose tools will report a problem in this case.\nIt could be solved by creating a new classic or fine-grained personal access token\n[there](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\nNo scopes are needed for classic tokens, not even `public_repo`.\nFor fine-grained tokens, only read-only access to public repositories is needed without any additional permissions.\nAfter generating a token, set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:\n\n```sh\nexport GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_XXX\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nexport GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_XXX\n```\n\n## Reporting a bug\n\nWe appreciate reporting a bug to us.\nTo help us accurately identify the cause, we encourage you to include a pull request with test script.\nPlease write the test script in [build/legacy-mongo-shell/test.js](build/legacy-mongo-shell/test.js).\nYou can find an overview of the available assertions [here](build/legacy-mongo-shell/README.md).\nUse these assertions to validate your test's assumptions and invariants.\nYou can also find an example of how to prepare a test script in\n[build/legacy-mongo-shell/test.example.js](build/legacy-mongo-shell/test.example.js).\n\nWith `task` installed (see above), you may test your script using following steps:\n\n1. Start the development environment with `task env-up`.\n2. Start FerretDB with `task run`.\n3. Run the test script with `task testjs`.\n\nPlease create a pull request and include the link of the pull request in the bug issue.\n\n## Contributing code\n\n### Commands for contributing code\n\nWith `task` installed (see above), you may do the following:\n\n1. Start the development environment with `task env-up`.\n2. Run all tests with `task test` (see [below](#running-tests)).\n3. Start FerretDB with `task run`, `task run-sqlite` or `task run-proxy`.\n   (See [Operation modes](https://docs.ferretdb.io/configuration/operation-modes/) page in our documentation.)\n4. Fill collections in the `test` database with data for experiments with `task env-data`.\n5. Run `mongosh` with `task mongosh`.\n   See what collections were created by the previous command with `show collections`.\n\n### Code overview\n\nThe directory `cmd` provides commands implementation.\nIts subdirectory `ferretdb` is the main FerretDB binary; others are tools for development.\n\nThe package `tools` uses [\"tools.go\" approach](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25922#issuecomment-402918061) to fix tools versions.\nThey are installed into `bin/` by `cd tools; go generate -x`.\n\nThe `internal` subpackages contain most of the FerretDB code:\n\n- `types` package provides Go types matching BSON types that don't have built-in Go equivalents:\n  we use `int32` for BSON's int32, but `types.ObjectID` for BSON's ObjectId.\n- `bson` package provides converters from/to BSON for built-in and `types` types.\n- `wire` package provides wire protocol implementation.\n- `clientconn` package provides client connection implementation.\n  It accepts client connections, reads `wire`/`bson` protocol messages, and passes them to `handler`.\n  Responses are then converted to `wire`/`bson` messages and sent back to the client.\n- `handler` contains implementations of command handlers.\n  They use `types` and `wire` packages, but `bson` package details are hidden.\n- `handler/sjson` provides converters from/to SJSON for built-in and `types` types.\n  SJSON adds some extensions to JSON for keeping object keys in order,\n  preserving BSON type information in the values themselves, etc.\n  It is used by some backends.\n\n#### Running tests\n\n`internal` packages are tested by \"unit\" tests that are placed inside those packages.\nSome of them are truly hermetic and test only the package that contains them;\nyou can run those \"short\" tests with `go test -short` or `task test-unit-short`,\nbut that's typically not required.\nOther unit tests use real databases;\nyou can run those with `task test-unit` after starting the environment as described above.\n\nWe also have a set of \"integration\" tests in the `integration` directory.\nThey use the Go MongoDB driver like a regular user application.\nThey could test any MongoDB-compatible database (such as FerretDB or MongoDB itself) via a regular TCP or TLS port\nor Unix domain socket.\nThey also could test in-process FerretDB instances\n(meaning that integration tests start and stop them themselves) with a given backend.\nFinally, some integration tests (so-called compatibility or \"compat\" tests) connect to two systems\n(\"target\" for FerretDB and \"compat\" for MongoDB) at the same time,\nsend the same queries to both, and compare results.\nYou can run them with:\n\n- `task test-integration-postgresql` for in-process FerretDB with PostgreSQL backend and MongoDB;\n- `task test-integration-mongodb` for MongoDB only, skipping compat tests;\n- or `task test-integration` to run all in parallel.\n\nYou may run all tests in parallel with `task test`.\nIf tests fail and the output is too confusing, try running them sequentially by using the commands above.\n\nYou can also run `task -C 1` to limit the number of concurrent tasks, which is useful for debugging.\n\nTo run a subset of integration tests and test cases, you may use Task variable `TEST_RUN`.\nFor example, to run all tests related to the `getMore` command implementation for in-process FerretDB with PostgreSQL backend\nyou may use `task test-integration-postgresql TEST_RUN='(?i)GetMore'`.\n\nFinally, since all tests just run `go test` with various arguments and flags under the hood\n(for example, `TEST_RUN` just provides the value for the [`-run` flag](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Testing_flags)),\nyou may also use all standard `go` tool facilities,\nincluding [`GOFLAGS` environment variable](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables).\nFor example:\n\n- to run all tests related to the `getMore` command implementation in-process FerretDB with PostgreSQL backend\n  with all subtests running sequentially,\n  you may use `env GOFLAGS='-parallel=1' task test-integration-postgresql TEST_RUN='(?i)GetMore'`;\n- to run all tests for in-process FerretDB with SQLite backend\n  with [Go execution tracer](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/trace) enabled,\n  you may use `env GOFLAGS='-trace=trace.out' task test-integration-sqlite`.\n\n<!-- textlint-disable one-sentence-per-line -->\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> It is not recommended to set `GOFLAGS` and other Go environment variables with `export GOFLAGS=...`\n> or `go env -w GOFLAGS=...` because they are invisible and easy to forget about, leading to confusion.\n\n<!-- textlint-enable one-sentence-per-line -->\n\nIn general, we prefer integration tests over unit tests,\ntests using real databases over short tests\nand real objects over mocks.\n\n(You might disagree with our terminology for \"unit\" and \"integration\" tests;\nlet's not fight over it.)\n\nWe have an additional integration testing system in another repository: https://github.com/FerretDB/dance.\n\n#### Observability in tests\n\nIntegration tests start a debug handler with pprof profiles and execution traces on a random port\n(to allow running multiple test configurations in parallel).\nThey also send telemetry traces to the local Jaeger instance that can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:16686/.\n\n### Code style and conventions\n\nAbove everything else, we value consistency in the source code.\nIf you see some code that doesn't follow some best practice but is consistent,\nplease keep it that way;\nbut please also tell us about it, so we can improve all of it.\nIf, on the other hand, you see code that is inconsistent without apparent reason (or comment),\nplease improve it as you work on it.\n\nOur code follows most of the standard Go conventions,\ndocumented on [CodeReviewComments wiki page](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments)\nand some other pages such as [Spelling](https://go.dev/wiki/Spelling).\nSome of our idiosyncrasies are documented below.\n\n1. We use type switches over BSON types in many places in our code.\n   The order of `case`s follows this order: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/internal/types#hdr-Mapping\n   It may seem random, but it is only pseudo-random and follows BSON spec: https://bsonspec.org/spec.html\n2. We generally pass and return `struct`s by pointers.\n   There are some exceptions like `types.Path` that have value semantics, but when in doubt – use pointers.\n\n#### Comments conventions\n\n1. All top-level declarations, even unexported, should have documentation comments.\n2. In documentation comments do not describe the name in terms of the name itself (`// Registry is a registry of …`).\n   Use other words instead; often, they could add additional information and make reading more pleasant (`// Registry stores …`).\n3. In code comments, in general, do not describe _what_ the code does: it should be clear from the code itself\n   (and when it doesn't and the code is tricky, simplify it instead).\n   Instead, describe _why_ the code does that if it is not clear from the surrounding context, names, etc.\n   There is no need to add comments just because there are no comments if everything is already clear without them.\n4. For code comments, write either\n   sentence fragments (do not start it with a capital letter, do not end it with a dot, use the simplified grammar) for short notes\n   or full sentences (do start them with capital letters, do end them with dots, do check their grammar) when a longer (2+ sentences)\n   explanation is needed (and the code could not be simplified).\n\n#### Logging conventions\n\n(See also our user documentation for notes about logging levels, logging sensitive information, etc.)\n\n1. Log messages should contain a single sentence; use a semicolon if you must.\n2. Log messages should not have leading/trailing spaces or end with punctuation.\n3. Log field names should use `snake_case`.\n4. Whatever sensitive information can be logged should be checked by calling `.Enabled(slog.LevelDebug)` on the appropriate logger,\n   not by directly comparing levels with `<` / `>` operators.\n   The same check should be applied if additional sensitive fields should be added to the log message on a different level.\n\n#### Integration tests conventions\n\nWe prefer our integration tests to be straightforward,\nbranchless (with a few, if any, `if` and `switch` statements),\nand backend-independent.\nIdeally, the same test should work for both FerretDB with all backends and MongoDB.\nIf that's impossible without some branching, use helpers exported from the `setup` package,\nsuch us `FailsForFerretDB`, `SkipForMongoDB`, etc.\nThe bar for using other ways of branching, such as checking error codes and messages, is very high.\nWriting separate tests might be much better than making a single test that checks error text.\n\nAlso, we should use driver methods as much as possible instead of testing commands directly via `RunCommand`.\n\nWe have a lot of existing helpers to convert the driver's `bson.D` values to our `*types.Document` values,\nto compare them, etc.\nIn most cases, they should be used instead of (deprecated) `bson.D.Map()`,\n`bson.Unmarshal`, decoding into a struct with `bson` tags, comparing fields one-by-one, etc.\nThe bar for adding new helpers is very high.\nPlease check all existing ones.\n\nIf there's a need to use any large number to test corner cases,\nwe create constants for them with explanation what do they represent, and refer to them.\nFor example:\n\n```go\nconst doubleMaxPrec = float64(1<<53 - 1) // 9007199254740991.0:    largest double values that could be represented as integer exactly\n```\n\n#### Integration tests naming guidelines\n\n<!-- https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/issues/694 -->\n\n1. Test names should include the name of the command being tested.\n   For instance, `TestDistinct` for testing the distinct command.\n2. Compatibility tests should have `Compat` in the name, following the command.\n   For example, `TestDistinctCompat`.\n3. If the test doesn't use driver method but runs a command directly via `RunCommand`,\n   the suffix `Command` should be added.\n   For example, `TestDistinctCommand`.\n4. If the test is both compat and runs a command, the suffix `CommandCompat` should be added.\n   For example, `TestInsertCommandCompat`.\n5. If the file consists of compatibility tests, add the `_compat` suffix.\n   For example, `distinct_compat_test.go`.\n6. Test names should be descriptive and provide information about the functionality or condition being tested.\n   If the test is checking for a specific error scenario, include the error scenario in the name.\n7. Keep test names concise, avoiding overly cryptic names.\n   Use abbreviations when appropriate.\n8. Avoid including test data in the name to maintain clarity and prevent excessively long names.\n9. Test case names should follow `TitleCase` capitalization style.\n   No spaces, dashes or underscores should be used neither for test names nor for test case names.\n10. Keep the concatenation of test name segments (test, subtests) within 64 characters\n    to satisfy the maximum limit for database names.\n\n### Submitting code changes\n\n#### Before submitting PR\n\nBefore submitting a pull request, please make sure that:\n\n1. Your changes are committed to a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)\n   created from the [current state](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)\n   of our main branch.\n2. Tests are added or updated for new functionality or fixed bugs.\n   Typical test cases include:\n   - happy paths;\n   - dot notation for existing and non-existent paths;\n   - edge cases for invalid or unexpected values or types.\n3. Comments are added or updated for all new or changed code.\n   Please add missing comments for all (both exported and unexported)\n   new and changed top-level declarations (`package`, `var`, `const`, `func`, `type`).\n   Please also check that formatting is correct in the `task godocs` output.\n4. `task all` passes.\n\n#### Submitting PR\n\n1. Please follow the pull request template.\n2. If the pull request is related to some issue,\n   please mention the issue number in the pull request description like `Closes #<issue_number>.`\n   or `Closes FerretDB/<repo>#<issue_number>.`\n   Please do not use URLs like `https://github.com/FerretDB/<repo>/issue/<issue_number>`\n   or paths like `FerretDB/<repo>/issue/<issue_number>` even if they are rendered the same on GitHub.\n   If you propose a tiny fix, there is no needed to create a new issue.\n3. There is no need to use draft pull requests.\n   If you want to get feedback on something you are working on,\n   please create a normal pull request, even if it is not \"fully\" ready yet.\n4. In the pull request review conversations,\n   please either leave a new comment or resolve (close) the conversation,\n   which ensures other people can read all comments.\n   But do not do that simultaneously.\n   Conversations should typically be resolved by the conversation starter, not the PR author.\n5. During development in a branch/PR,\n   commit messages (both titles and bodies) are not important and can be anything.\n   All commits are always squashed on merge by GitHub.\n   Please **do not** squash them manually, amend them, and/or force push them -\n   that makes the review process harder.\n6. Please don't forget to click\n   [\"re-request review\" buttons](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review)\n   once PR is ready for re-review.\n\nIf you have interest in becoming or are a long-term contributor,\nplease read [PROCESS.md](.github/PROCESS.md) for more details.\n\n## Contributing documentation\n\n### Commands for contributing documentation\n\nWith `task` installed (see above), you may do the following:\n\n1.

making it unusable for many open source and early-stage commercial projects.\n\nMost MongoDB users do not require any advanced features offered by MongoDB;\nhowever, they need an easy-to-use open-source document database solution.\nRecognizing this, FerretDB is here to fill that gap.\n\n## Scope and current state\n\nFerretDB is compatible with MongoDB drivers and popular MongoDB tools.\nIt functions as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB 5.0+ in many cases.\nFeatures are constantly being added to further increase compatibility and performance.\n\nWe welcome all contributors.\nSee our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FerretDB/projects/2/views/1),\na list of [known differences with MongoDB](https://docs.ferretdb.io/diff/),\nand [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Quickstart\n\nRun this command to start FerretDB with PostgreSQL backend:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 ghcr.io/ferretdb/all-in-one\n```\n\nAlternatively, run this command to start FerretDB with SQLite backend:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -d --rm --name ferretdb -p 27017:27017 -e FERRETDB_HANDLER=sqlite ghcr.io/ferretdb/all-in-one\n```\n\nThis command will start a container with FerretDB, PostgreSQL/SQLite, and MongoDB Shell for quick testing and experiments.\nHowever, it is unsuitable for production use cases because it keeps all data inside and loses it on shutdown.\nSee our [Docker quickstart guide](https://docs.ferretdb.io/quickstart-guide/docker/) for instructions\nthat don't have those problems.\n\nWith that container running, you can:\n\n- Connect to it with any MongoDB client application using MongoDB URI `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/`.\n- Connect to it using MongoDB Shell by just running `mongosh`.\n  If you don't have it installed locally, you can run `docker exec -it ferretdb mongosh`.\n- For the PostgreSQL backend, connect to it by running `docker exec -it ferretdb psql -U username ferretdb`.\n  FerretDB uses PostgreSQL schemas for MongoDB databases.\n  So, if you created some collections in the `test` database using any MongoDB client,\n  you can switch to it by running `SET search_path = 'test';` query\n  and see a list of PostgreSQL tables by running `\\d` `psql` command.\n- For the SQLite backend, connect to it by running `docker exec -it ferretdb sqlite3 /state/<database>.sqlite`.\n  So, if you created some collections in the `test` database using any MongoDB client,\n  run `docker exec -it ferretdb sqlite3 /state/test.sqlite`\n  and see a list of SQLite tables by running `.tables` command.\n\nYou can stop the container with `docker stop ferretdb`.\n\nWe also provide binaries and packages for various Linux distributions,\nas well as [Go library package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb) that embeds FerretDB into your application.\nSee [our documentation](https://docs.ferretdb.io/quickstart-guide/) for more details.\n\n## Building and packaging\n\n<!-- textlint-disable one-sentence-per-line -->\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> We strongly advise users not to build FerretDB themselves.\n> Instead, use binaries, Docker images, or packages provided by us.\n\n<!-- textlint-enable one-sentence-per-line -->\n\nFerretDB could be built as any other Go program,\nbut a few generated files and build tags could affect it.\nSee [there](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/build/version) for more details.\n\n## Managed FerretDB at cloud providers\n\n- [Civo](https://www.civo.com/marketplace/FerretDB)\n- [Tembo](https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/mongo-alternative)\n- [Elestio](https://elest.io/open-source/ferretdb)\n- [Cozystack](https://cozystack.io/docs/components/#managed-ferretdb).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Documentation for users](https://docs.ferretdb.io/).\n- [Documentation for Go developers about embeddable FerretDB](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb).\n\n## Community\n\n- Website and blog: https://www.ferretdb.com/.\n- Twitter: [@ferret_db](https://twitter.com/ferret_db).\n- Mastodon: [@ferretdb@techhub.social](https://techhub.social/@ferretdb).\n- [Slack chat](https://join.slack.com/t/ferretdb/shared_invite/zt-zqe9hj8g-ZcMG3~5Cs5u9uuOPnZB8~A) for quick questions.\n- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/discussions) for longer topics.\n- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/issues) for bugs and missing features.\n- [Open Office Hours meeting](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NGhrZTA5dXZ0MzQzN2gyaGVtZmx2aWxmN2pfMjAyNDA0MDhUMTcwMDAwWiBjX24zN3RxdW9yZWlsOWIwMm0wNzQwMDA3MjQ0QGc&tmsrc=c_n37tquoreil9b02m0740007244%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL)\n  every Monday at 17:00 UTC at [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/mcb-arhw-qbq).\n\nIf you want to contact FerretDB Inc., please use [this form](https://www.ferretdb.com/contact/).\n"
