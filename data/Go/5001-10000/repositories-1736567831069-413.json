Please read it before you make any contributions.\n\nIf you need any help or want to talk about about a specific issue, you can always reach out to me from my mail:ege@permify.co.\n\nYou're always more than welcome to our other communication channels.\n\n## Communication Channels\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/n6KfzYxhPp\">\n <img height=\"70px\" width=\"70px\" alt=\"permify | Discord\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39353278/187209316-3d01a799-c51b-4eaa-8f52-168047078a14.png\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GetPermify\">\n  <img height=\"70px\" width=\"70px\" alt=\"permify | Twitter\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39353278/187209323-23f14261-d406-420d-80eb-1aa707a71043.png\"/>\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/permifyco\">\n  <img height=\"70px\" width=\"70px\" alt=\"permify | Linkedin\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39353278/187209321-03293a24-6f63-4321-b362-b0fc89fdd879.png\" />\n</a>\n</p>\n\n## Ways to contribute\n\n* **Contribute to codebase:** We're collaboratively working with our community to make Permify the best it can be! You can develop new features, fix existing issues or make third-party integrations/packages. \n* **Improve documentation:** Alongside our codebase, documentation is one of the most significant things in our open-source journey. We're trying to give the best DX possible to explain ourselves and Permify. And you can help on that by improving resources or adding new ones.\n* **Contribute to playground:** Permify playground allows you to visualize and test your authorization logic. You can contribute to our playground by improving its user interface, fixing glitches, or adding new features.\n\n### Contribution Steps\n\n- Fork this repository.\n- Clone the repository you forked.\n- Create a branch with specified name. It's better to relate it with your issue title.\n- Make necessary changes and commit those changes. Make sure to test your changes. \n- Push changes to your branch.\n- Submit your changes for review.\n\n## Commit convention\n\nWe use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to keep our commit messages consistent and easy to understand. Here is the applied form of a commit message.\n\n```\n<type>(optional scope): <description>\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- `feat: added multi tenant authentication support`\n- `fix: fixed welcomeServer duplicated syntax`\n- `docs: update the deployment options on set up section`\n\n### Types\n\n`fix:`,  `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`\n\n## Running Tests \n\nIn order to contribute and test in our codebase you need to have Go version 1.19 or higher.\n\n```go test -v ./...```\n\n### Adding dependencies\nPermify is not using anything other than the standard Go modules toolchain to manage dependencies.\n\n```go get github.com/org/newdependency@version```\n\n### Updating generated Protobuf code\nAll Protobuf code is managed using buf.\n\n```buf generate```\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you found any bug, have feature request or just want to improve our code base, docs or other resources; you can open an issue about it to let us know. If you plan to work on an existing issue, mention us on the issue page before you start working on it so we can assign you to it.\n\n### When opening a issue\n\n- If you plan to work on a problem, please check that same problem or topic does not already exist.\n- If you plan to work on a new feature, our advise is to discuss it with other community members/maintainers who might give you an idea or support.\n- If you're stuck anywhere, ask for help in our discord community.\n- Please relate one bug with one issue, do not use issues as bug lists. \n\nYou can create an issue and contribute to anything you want, but please ensure to follow the steps above. We will definitely ease your work and help on anything when needed.\n\n\n"

Inspired by Google’s consistent, global authorization system, [Google Zanzibar](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41f08f03da59f5518802898f68730e247e23c331.pdf)\n\nOur service makes authorization more secure and adaptable to changing needs, allowing you to get it up and running in just a few minutes to a couple of days—no need to spend months building out entire piece of infrastructure.\n\nIt works in run time and can respond to any type of access control checks (can user X view document Y?, which posts can members of team Y edit?, etc.) from any of your apps and services in tens of milliseconds.\n\n### With Permify, you can:\n\n🧪 **Centralize & Standardize Your Authorization**: Abstract your authorization logic from your codebase and application logic to easily reason, test, and debug your authorization. Behave your authorization as a sole entity and move faster with in your core development.\n\n🔮 **Build Granular Permissions For Any Case You Have:** You can create granular (resource-specific, hierarchical, context aware, etc) permissions and policies using Permify's domain specific language that is compatible with RBAC, ReBAC and ABAC.\n\n🔐 **Set Authorization For Your Tenants By Default**: Set up isolated authorization logic and custom permissions for your vendors/organizations (tenants) and manage them in a single place.\n\n🚀 **Scale Your Authorization As You Wish:** Achieve lightning-fast response times down to 10ms for access checks with a proven infrastructure inspired by Google Zanzibar.\n\n## Getting Started \n\n- Follow a guide to model your authorization using [Permify's Authorization Language].\n- See our [Playground], build your authorization logic and test it with sample data.\n- Explore overview of [Permify API] and learn how to interact with it.\n- See [our article] to examine [Google Zanzibar](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41f08f03da59f5518802898f68730e247e23c331.pdf) in a nutshell.\n- Explore our [SDK samples] for hands-on examples.\n\n[Permify's Authorization Language]: https://docs.permify.co/getting-started/modeling\n[playground]: https://play.permify.co/\n[Permify API]: https://docs.permify.co/api-reference\n[our article]: https://permify.co/post/google-zanzibar-in-a-nutshell\n[SDK samples]: https://github.com/Permify/permify/tree/master/sdk\n\n## Permify Cloud vs Self-hosted?\n\nPermify is [open-source authorization service](https://permify.co/) and we have a free and self-hosted solution called **Permify Community Edition (CE)**. Here are the differences between Permify managed hosting in the cloud and the Permify CE:\n\n|  | Permify Cloud  | Permify Community Edition |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| **Infrastructure management** | Easy and convenient. It takes minutes to start permissions systems deployed on secure Permify infrastructure with a high availability, backups, security and maintenance all done for you by us. We manage everything so you don’t have to worry about anything and can focus on your core development. | You do it all yourself. You need to get a server and you need to manage your infrastructure. You are responsible for installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup, security, stability, consistency, latency and so on.|\n| **Release schedule** | Continuously developed and improved with new features and updates multiple times per week. | It's a long-term release published four times per year, so the latest features and improvements won’t be immediately available.|\n| **Premium features** | All features available as listed in [our pricing plans](https://permify.co/pricing/). | Selected premium features, such as observability dashboards and data synchronization are not available as we aim to maintain a protective barrier around our cloud offering.|\n| **Deployment regions** | You can select your preferred region, supported by **AWS**, **GCP**, or **Azure** to deploy your authorization system. Disaster recovery zones are strategically located to replicate data across regions, ensuring rapid recovery and continuous service during any incident. We also provide **SLAs** to ensure availability and latency. | You have full control and can host your instance on any server in any country of your choice. This includes hosting on personal servers or with cloud providers. |\n| **Data privacy** | Permify Cloud is **SOC2 and GDPR compliant**, ensuring adherence to stringent data protection standards. You can check out our [Trust Center](https://trust.permify.co/) for comprehensive insights into our data management, security measures, and compliance practices. | Data privacy management is your responsibility. While you have full control over your data, it is up to you to implement and maintain necessary compliance measures, such as GDPR or SOC 2, as well as other security protocols. |\n| **Premium support** | Real support delivered by real human beings who build and maintain Permify. | Premium support is not included. CE is community supported only.|\n| **Costs** | There’s a cost associated with providing an authorization service, so we base our pricing on the number of monthly active users you have. Your payments fund the further development of Permify. | You need to pay for your server, CDN, backups, and other costs associated with running the infrastructure you need. |\n\nInterested in trying out Permify Cloud?
