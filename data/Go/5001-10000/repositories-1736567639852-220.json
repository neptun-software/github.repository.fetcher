          "content": "# Deprecated\n\nUse https://github.com/shadowsocks/go-shadowsocks2 instead.\n\n# shadowsocks-go\n\nCurrent version: 1.2.2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go)\n\nshadowsocks-go is a lightweight tunnel proxy which can help you get through firewalls. It is a port of [shadowsocks](https://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks).\n\nThe protocol is compatible with the origin shadowsocks (if both have been upgraded to the latest version).\n\n**Note `server_password` option syntax changed in 0.6.2, the client now connects to servers in the order specified in the config.**\n\n**Please develop on the latest develop branch if you want to send pull request.**\n\n# Install\n\nDownload precompiled binarys from the [release page](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/releases). (All compiled with cgo disabled, except the mac version.)\n\nYou can also install from source (assume you have go installed):\n\n```\n# on server\ngo get github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/cmd/shadowsocks-server\n# on client\ngo get github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/cmd/shadowsocks-local\n```\n\nIt's recommended to disable cgo when compiling shadowsocks-go. This will prevent the go runtime from creating too many threads for dns lookup.\n\n# Usage\n\nBoth the server and client program will look for `config.json` in the current directory. You can use `-c` option to specify another configuration file.\n\nConfiguration file is in json format and has the same syntax with [shadowsocks-nodejs](https://github.com/clowwindy/shadowsocks-nodejs/). You can download the sample [`config.json`](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/blob/master/config.json), change the following values:\n\n```\nserver          your server ip or hostname\nserver_port     server port\nlocal_port      local socks5 proxy port\nmethod          encryption method, null by default (table), the following methods are supported:\n                    aes-128-cfb, aes-192-cfb, aes-256-cfb, bf-cfb, cast5-cfb, des-cfb, rc4-md5, rc4-md5-6, chacha20, salsa20, rc4, table\npassword        a password used to encrypt transfer\ntimeout         server option, in seconds\n```\n\nRun `shadowsocks-server` on your server. To run it in the background, run `shadowsocks-server > log &`.\n\nOn client, run `shadowsocks-local`. Change proxy settings of your browser to\n\n```\nSOCKS5 127.0.0.1:local_port\n```\n\n## About encryption methods\n\nAES is recommended for shadowsocks-go. [Intel AES Instruction Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set) will be used if available and can make encryption/decryption very fast. To be more specific, **`aes-128-cfb` is recommended as it is faster and [secure enough](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/another_new_aes.html)**.\n\n**rc4 and table encryption methods are deprecated because they are not secure.**\n\n### One Time Auth\n\nOTA function is deprecated because it is reported to have potential security risk.\n\n## Command line options\n\nCommand line options can override settings from configuration files. Use `-h` option to see all available options.\n\n```\nshadowsocks-local -s server_address -p server_port -k password\n    -m aes-128-cfb -c config.json\n    -b local_address -l local_port\nshadowsocks-server -p server_port -k password\n    -m aes-128-cfb -c config.json\n    -t timeout\n```\n\nUse `-d` option to enable debug message.\n\n## Use multiple servers on client\n\n```\nserver_password    specify multiple server and password, server should be in the form of host:port\n```\n\nHere's a sample configuration [`client-multi-server.json`](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/blob/master/sample-config/client-multi-server.json). Given `server_password`, client program will ignore `server_port`, `server` and `password` options.\n\nServers are chosen in the order specified in the config. If a server can't be connected (connection failure), the client will try the next one. (Client will retry failed server with some probability to discover server recovery.)\n\n## Multiple users with different passwords on server\n\nThe server can support users with different passwords. Each user will be served by a unique port. Use the following options on the server for such setup:\n\n```\nport_password   specify multiple ports and passwords to support multiple users\n```\n\nHere's a sample configuration [`server-multi-port.json`](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/blob/master/sample-config/server-multi-port.json). Given `port_password`, server program will ignore `server_port` and `password` options.\n\n### Update port password for a running server\n\nEdit the config file used to start the server, then send `SIGHUP` to the server process.\n\n# Note to OpenVZ users\n\n**Use OpenVZ VM that supports vswap**. Otherwise, the OS will incorrectly account much more memory than actually used. shadowsocks-go on OpenVZ VM with vswap takes about 3MB memory after startup. (Refer to [this issue](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go/issues/3) for more details.)\n\nIf vswap is not an option and memory usage is a problem for you, try [shadowsocks-libev](https://github.com/madeye/shadowsocks-libev).\n"
