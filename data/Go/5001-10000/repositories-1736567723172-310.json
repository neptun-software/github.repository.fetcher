Remember when you update an issue or respond\n  to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Please\n  consider this before you update. Also remember that nobody likes spam.\n\n* Don't send email to the maintainers: There's no need to send email to the\n  maintainers to ask them to investigate an issue or to take a look at a\n  pull request. Instead of sending an email, GitHub mentions should be\n  used to ping maintainers to review a pull request, a proposal or an\n  issue.\n\n### Guideline violations — 3 strikes method\n\nThe point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we\ndo need a fair way to deal with people who are making our community suck.\n\n1. First occurrence: We'll give you a friendly, but public reminder that the\n   behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.\n\n2. Second occurrence: We will send you a private message with a warning that\n   any additional violations will result in removal from the community.\n\n3. Third occurrence: Depending on the violation, we may need to delete or ban\n   your account.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Obvious spammers are banned on first occurrence. If we don't do this, we'll\n  have spam all over the place.\n\n* Violations are forgiven after 6 months of good behavior, and we won't hold a\n  grudge.\n\n* People who commit minor infractions will get some education, rather than\n  hammering them in the 3 strikes process.\n\n* The rules apply equally to everyone in the community, no matter how much\n        you've contributed.\n\n* Extreme violations of a threatening, abusive, destructive or illegal nature\n        will be addressed immediately and are not subject to 3 strikes or forgiveness.\n\n* Contact abuse@docker.com to report abuse or appeal violations. In the case of\n        appeals, we know that mistakes happen, and we'll work with you to come up with a\n        fair solution if there has been a misunderstanding."

This repository is no longer the “source of truth” for Docker CE builds.\n2. The commit SHA and tag for Docker CLI build will come from the\n   [docker/cli](https://github.com/docker/cli) repository and the commit SHA and\n   tag for the Docker Engine will come from the\n   [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) repository.\n3. Release branches for the Engine, CLI, and packaging will be maintained on\n   their respective repositories.\n4. Updates will stop being made to this repository and it will be archived in\n   the future.\n5. Changelog is now\n   [Release Notes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/).\n6. The `master` branch of this repository will be emptied when the repository\n   is archived.\n\n## Description\n\nThis repository hosts open source components of Docker CE products. The\n`master` branch serves to unify the upstream components on a regular\nbasis. Long-lived release branches host the code that goes into a product\nversion for the lifetime of the product.\n\nThis repository is solely maintained by Docker, Inc.\n\n## Issues\n\nThere are separate issue-tracking repos for the end user Docker CE\nproducts specialized for a platform. Find your issue or file a new issue\nfor the platform you are using:\n\n* https://github.com/docker/for-linux\n* https://github.com/docker/for-mac\n* https://github.com/docker/for-win\n\n## Submitting pull requests\n\nThis repository does not accept PRs for files under the [components](components) directory directly.\nTo contribute to the files under the components directory, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-pull-requests) .\n\n## Unifying upstream sources\n\nThe `master` branch is a combination of components adapted from\ndifferent upstream git repos into a unified directory structure using the\n[moby-components](https://github.com/shykes/moby-extras/blob/master/cmd/moby-components)\ntool.\n\nYou can view the upstream git repos in the\n[components.conf](components.conf) file. Each component is isolated into\nits own directory under the [components](components) directory.\n\nThe tool will import each component git history within the appropriate path.\n\nFor example, this shows a commit\nis imported into the component `engine` from\n[moby/moby@a27b4b8](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/a27b4b8cb8e838d03a99b6d2b30f76bdaf2f9e5d)\ninto the `components/engine` directory.\n\n```\ncommit 5c70746915d4589a692cbe50a43cf619ed0b7152\nAuthor: Andrea Luzzardi <aluzzardi@gmail.com>\nDate:   Sat Jan 19 00:13:39 2013\n\n    Initial commit\n    Upstream-commit: a27b4b8cb8e838d03a99b6d2b30f76bdaf2f9e5d\n    Component: engine\n\n components/engine/container.go       | 203 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/container_test.go  | 186 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/docker.go          | 112 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/docker_test.go     | 175 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/filesystem.go      |  52 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/filesystem_test.go |  35 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n components/engine/lxc_template.go    |  94 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/state.go           |  48 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/utils.go           | 115 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n components/engine/utils_test.go      | 126 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...\n 10 files changed, 1146 insertions(+)\n```\n\n## Updates to `master` branch\n\nMain development of new features should be directed towards the upstream\ngit repos. The `master` branch of this repo will periodically pull in new\nchanges from upstream to provide a point for integration.\n\n## Branching for release\n\nWhen a release is started for Docker CE, a new branch will be created\nfrom `master`. Branch names will be `YY.MM` to represent the time-based\nrelease version of the product, e.g. `17.06`.\n\n## Adding fixes to release branch\n\nNote: every commit of a fix should affect files only within one component\ndirectory.\n\n### Fix available upstream\n\nA PR cherry-picking the necessary commits should be created against\nthe release branch. If the the cherry-pick cannot be applied cleanly,\nthe logic of the fix should be ported manually.\n\n### No fix yet\n\nFirst create the PR with the fix for the release branch. Once the fix has\nbeen merged, be sure to port the fix to the respective upstream git repo.\n\n## Release tags\n\nThere will be a git tag for each release candidate (RC) and general\navailability (GA) release. The tag will only point to commits on release\nbranches.\n"
