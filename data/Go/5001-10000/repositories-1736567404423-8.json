          "content": "# Contributing to Tyk\n\n**First**: if you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.\n\nHowever, for those individuals who want a bit more guidance on the best way to contribute to the project, read on. This document will cover what we're looking for. By addressing all the points we're looking for, it raises the chances we can quickly merge or address your contributions.\n\n## Filing issues\n\nIf you have a question about Tyk or have a problem using it, please\nstart with the GitHub search and our [community forum](https://community.tyk.io). If that doesn't answer your questions, or if you think you found a bug, please [file an\nissue](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/issues/new).\n\n## How to become a contributor and submit your own code\n\n### Contributor License Agreements\n\nWe'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.\n\nThe Tyk CLA [must be signed](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/blob/master/CLA.md) by all contributors. You will be automatically asked to sign CLA once PR will be created.\n\nOnce you are CLA'ed, we'll be able to accept your pull requests. For any issues that you face during this process, please create a GitHub issue explaining the problem and we will help get it sorted out.\n\n***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have\nsigned the CLA can be accepted into the repository. This policy does not\napply to [vendor](vendor/).\n\n### Finding Things That Need Help\n\nIf you're new to the project and want to help, but don't know where to start,\nwe have a semi-curated list of issues that have should not need deep knowledge\nof the system.  [Have a look and see if anything sounds\ninteresting](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahelp-wanted).\n\nAlternatively, read some of the [many docs on the system](https://tyk.io/docs/getting-started/), and pick a component that seems\ninteresting.  Start with `main()` and read\nuntil you find something you want to fix.  The best way to learn is to hack!\nThere's always code that can be clarified and variables or functions that can\nbe renamed or commented.\n\n### `master` is unstable\n\nWe will do our best to keep master in good shape, with tests passing at all times. But in order to move fast, we will make API changes that your application might not be compatible with. We will do our best to communicate these changes and version appropriately so you can lock into a specific version if need be. For stable releases check our tags and `stable` branch, which contains our latest stable release.\n\n\n### Contributing A Patch\n\nIf you're working on an existing issue, such as one of the `help-wanted` ones\nabove, simply respond to the issue and express interest in working on it.  This\nhelps other people know that the issue is active, and hopefully prevents\nduplicated efforts.\n\nIf you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:\n\n1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.\n1. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.\n1. Clone the repo, develop, and test your changes.\n1. Submit a pull request.\n1. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a\n   Contributor License Agreement (see details above).\n\nIf you want to work on a bigger idea, we **strongly** recommend that you start with\nsome bugs or smaller features. It is always better to discuss your idea with our team first, before implementing it.\n\n### Downloading the project\nYou need to clone Tyk from GitHub to your GOPATH folder, or alternatively you can run `go get -d github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk` which automatically downloads project to the right path.\n\n### Building the project\nYou need to have working Go environment: see [golang.org](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) for more info on how Go works with code.\n\nTo build and test Tyk use built-in `go` commands: `go build` and `go test -v`. If you want to just test a subset of the project, you can pass the `-run` argument with the name of the test. Note that logs are hidden by default when running the tests, which you can override by setting `TYK_LOGLEVEL=info`.\n\nCurrently, in order for tests to pass, a **Redis host is required**. We know, this is terrible and should be handled with an interface, and it is, however in the current version there is a hard requirement for the application to have its default memory setup to use Redis as part of a deployment, this is to make it easier to install the application for the end-user. Future versions will work around this, or we may drop the memory requirement. The simplest way to run Redis is to use official Docker image [https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/)\n\n#### Using Task Commands\n\nIn addition to the standard Go commands, we also provide [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) commands to simplify the setup and local dev process. \nIf you haven't installed Task yet, please follow the [installation instructions](https://taskfile.dev/installation).\n\nOnce Task is installed, you can use the following commands:\n\n```shell\ntask setup   # Sets up the project depdendencies, including pre-commit hooks\ntask test:integration    # Runs the tests\n```\n\n### Geo IP features\nThis product utilises GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from [http://www.maxmind.com](http://www.maxmind.com).\n"

Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n\n\n## 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n\n## 5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n\n## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n**Covered Software is provided under this License on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.**\n\n\n## 7. Limitation of Liability\n\n**Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.**\n\n\n## 8. Litigation\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.  Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n\n## 9. Miscellaneous\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n## 10. Versions of the License\n\n### 10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n### 10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n\n### 10.3. Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n\n### 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\n\n## Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n> This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

Later, you can move to one of our other [supported distributions](https://tyk.io/docs/apim/open-source/installation/) if you prefer.\n\n#### Step 1 - Clone the docker-compose repository\n```console\ngit clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker\n```\n\n#### Step 2 - Change to the new directory\n```console\ncd tyk-gateway-docker\n```\n\n#### Step 3 - Deploy Tyk Gateway and Redis\n```console\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nYou can run this in detach mode using the `-d` flag: `docker-compose up -d`\n\n**Congratulations, you’re done!**\n\nYour Tyk Gateway is now configured and ready to use. Confirm this by checking against the ‘hello’ endpoint:\n```console\ncurl localhost:8080/hello\n```\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"status\": \"pass\", \"version\": \"v3.2.1\", \"description\": \"Tyk GW\"}\n```\n\nNext, visit [adding your first API](https://tyk.io/docs/getting-started/create-api/) to Tyk and follow the Open Source instructions.\n\n---\n\nOther Installations are available:\n\n1.

There are countless discussions if you should write integration or unit tests, should your mock or not, should you write tests first or after and etc. Since you will never find the right answer, on a growing code base, multiple people start introducing own methodology and distinct test helpers. Even looking at our quite small code base, you can find like 3-4 ways to write the same test.\n\nThis document describes Tyk test framework and unified guidelines on writing tests.\n\nMain points of the test framework are:\n- All tests run HTTP requests though the full HTTP stack, same as user will do\n- Test definition logic separated from test runner.\n- Official mocks for the Dashboard, RPC, and Bundler\n- Most of the time, you will need a gateway instance to use the gateway functions and properties\n\nFramework located inside \"github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/test\" package.\nSee its API docs https://godoc.org/github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/test\n\nLet’s learn by example:\n\n```go\nfunc genAuthHeader(username, password string) string {\n\ttoEncode := strings.Join([]string{username, password}, \":\")\n\tencodedPass := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(toEncode))\n\treturn fmt.Sprintf(\"Basic %s\", encodedPass)\n}\n\nfunc TestBasicAuth(t *testing.T) {\n\tts := StartTest(nil)\n\tdefer ts.Close()\n\n\tsession := ts.testPrepareBasicAuth(false)\n\n\tvalidPassword := map[string]string{\"Authorization\": genAuthHeader(\"user\", \"password\")}\n\twrongPassword := map[string]string{\"Authorization\": genAuthHeader(\"user\", \"wrong\")}\n\twrongFormat := map[string]string{\"Authorization\": genAuthHeader(\"user\", \"password:more\")}\n\tmalformed := map[string]string{\"Authorization\": \"not base64\"}\n\n\tts.Run(t, []test.TestCase{\n\t\t// Create base auth based key\n\t\t{Method: \"POST\", Path: \"/tyk/keys/defaultuser\", Data: session, AdminAuth: true, Code: 200},\n\t\t{Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Code: 401, BodyMatch: `Authorization field missing`},\n\t\t{Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Headers: validPassword, Code: 200},\n\t\t{Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Headers: wrongPassword, Code: 401},\n\t\t{Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Headers: wrongFormat, Code: 400, BodyMatch: `Attempted access with malformed header, values not in basic auth format`},\n\t\t{Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Headers: malformed, Code: 400, BodyMatch: `Attempted access with malformed header, auth data not encoded correctly`},\n\t}...)\n}\n```\n\n[Direct Github link](https://github.com/matiasinsaurralde/tyk/blob/4b6e0290ee36f6721b8d5343051bf343900b5943/mw_basic_auth_test.go)\n\nAnd now compare it with previous Go style approach:\n\n```go\nfunc TestBasicAuthWrongPassword(t *testing.T) {\n    spec := createSpecTest(t, basicAuthDef)\n    session := createBasicAuthSession()\n    username := \"4321\"\n\n    // Basic auth sessions are stored as {org-id}{username}, so we need to append it here when we create the session.\n    spec.SessionManager.UpdateSession(\"default4321\", session, 60)\n\n    to_encode := strings.Join([]string{username, \"WRONGPASSTEST\"}, \":\")\n    encodedPass := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(to_encode))\n\n    recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()\n    req := testReq(t, \"GET\", \"/\", nil)\n    req.Header.Set(\"Authorization\", fmt.Sprintf(\"Basic %s\", encodedPass))\n\n    chain := getBasicAuthChain(spec)\n    chain.ServeHTTP(recorder, req)\n\n    if recorder.Code == 200 {\n        t.Error(\"Request should have failed and returned non-200 code!: \\n\", recorder.Code)\n    }\n\n    if recorder.Code != 401 {\n        t.Error(\"Request should have returned 401 code!: \\n\", recorder.Code)\n    }\n\n    if recorder.Header().Get(\"WWW-Authenticate\") == \"\" {\n        t.Error(\"Request should have returned WWW-Authenticate header!: \\n\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n[Direct Github link](https://github.com/matiasinsaurralde/tyk/blob/2a9d7d5b6c289ac75dfa9b4e9c4527f1041d7daf/mw_basic_auth_test.go#L246:1)\n\nNote that in the last “classic” way we defined only 1 test case, while in with our new framework we defined 6, all of them repeatable, and share the same assertion and test runner logic provided by framework. \n\nNow lets review tests written with a new framework piece by piece.\n### Initializing test server\nOne of the core ideas, is that tests should be as close as possible to real users. In order to implement it, framework provides you a way to programmatically start and stop full Gateway HTTP stack using `tykTestServer` object, like this:\n\n```go\nts := StartTest(nil)\ndefer ts.Close()\n```\n\n## About StartTest\nStarTest() is a function that will and setup a gateway instance, it receive as parameters:\n\n- genConf(*config.Config): is a function to override the gateway config set by default, if you don't want to override any config then you must sent a nil value. Example:\n```\nconf := func(confi *config.Config) {\n\t\tconfi.EventHandlers = eventsConf.EventHandlers\n\t}\nts := StartTest(conf)\ndefer ts.Close()\n```\n- testConfig: you can configure server behavior using few variable, like setting control API on a separate port, by providing `TestConfig` object. Here is the list of all possible arguments:\n\n```go\n\tts := gateway.StartTest(nil, gateway.TestConfig{\n           // Run control API on a separate port\n           sepatateControlAPI: true,\n           // Add delay after each test case, if you code depend on timing\n           // Bad practice, but sometimes needed\n           delay: 10 * time.Millisecond,\n           // Emulate that Gateway restarted using SIGUSR2\n           hotReload: true,\n           // Emulate that listener will \n           overrideDefaults, true,\n           // if you want to skip the redis cleaning process\n           SkipEmptyRedis: false\n    })\n    defer ts.Close()\n```\n\nStartTest() returns a Test object that contains:\n\n- URL: where the gateway is reachable\n- testRunner: the HttpTestRunner to use to consume and test endpoints\n- config: a TestConfig object on how to run the test, we pass this as param to `StartTest()` when starting the test\n- Gw: a full gateway instance, from which we can call any gateway function, get the current gateway config or even modify it\n- HttpHandler: the HTTP server\n\nWhen you create a new server, it initialize gateway itself, starts listener on random port, setup required global variables and etc. It is very similar to what happens when you start gateway process, but in this case you can start, stop and reload it on demand.\n\nTo close the server simply call `Test#Close` method, which will ensure that all the listeners will be properly closed. \n\n### Loading and configuring APIs\n\n```go\nts := gateway.StartTest(nil)\ndefer ts.Close()\n\nts.Gw.buildAndLoadAPI(func(spec *APISpec) {\n    spec.UseBasicAuth = true\n    spec.UseKeylessAccess = false\n    spec.Proxy.ListenPath = \"/\"\n    spec.OrgID = \"default\"\n})\n```\n\nBasic idea that you have default bare minimum API definition, which you can configure using generator function, to set state required for the test. API then will be loaded into the Gateway, and will be ready to be used inside tests.\n\nIf you need to load multiple APIs at the same time, `buildAndLoadAPI` support variadic number of arguments: `buildAndLoadAPI(<fn1>, <fn2>, ...)`\n\nYou can also call it without arguments at all, in this case it will load default API definition: `buildAndLoadAPI()`\n\nIn fact, this function is mashup of 2 lower level functions: `buildAPI` and `loadAPI`, both returning `[]*APISpec` array. In some cases you may need to build API template, and with some smaller modifications load it on demand in different tests. So it can look like:\n\n```go\nts := gateway.StartTest(nil)\ndefer ts.Close()\n\nspec := buildAPI(<fn>)\n...\nspec.SomeField = \"Case1\"\nts.Gw.loadAPI(spec)\n...\nspec.SomeField = \"Case2\"\nts.Gw.loadAPI(spec)\n```\n\nUpdating variables inside API version can be tricky, because API version object is inside `Versions` map, and direct manipulations with map value is prohibited. To simplify this process, there is special helper `updateAPIVersion`, which can be used like this:\n\n```go\nts := gateway.StartTest(nil)\ndefer ts.Close()\n\nts.Gw.updateAPIVersion(spec, \"v1\", func(v *apidef.VersionInfo) {\n    v.Paths.BlackList = []string{\"/blacklist/literal\", \"/blacklist/{id}/test\"}\n    v.UseExtendedPaths = false\n})\n```\n\nIn some cases updating API definition via Go structures can be a bit complex, and you may want to update API definition directly via JSON unmarshaling:\n\n```go\n ts := gateway.StartTest(nil)\n defer ts.Close()\n\n ts.Gw.updateAPIVersion(spec, \"v1\", func(v *apidef.VersionInfo) {\n     json.Unmarshal([]byte(`[\n         {\n            \"path\": \"/ignored/literal\",\n            \"method_actions\": {\"GET\": {\"action\": \"no_action\"}}\n        },\n        {\n            \"path\": \"/ignored/{id}/test\",\n            \"method_actions\": {\"GET\": {\"action\": \"no_action\"}}\n        }\n    ]`), &v.ExtendedPaths.Ignored)\n })\n ```\n\n### Running the tests\n\n```go\nts.Run(t, []test.TestCase{\n        // Create base auth based key\n        {Method: \"POST\", Path: \"/tyk/keys/defaultuser\", Data: session, AdminAuth: true, Code: 200},\n        {Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Code: 401, BodyMatch: `Authorization field missing`},\n        {Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Headers: validPassword, Code: 200},\n        {Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Headers: wrongPassword, Code: 401},\n        {Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Headers: wrongFormat, Code: 400, BodyMatch: `Attempted access with malformed header, values not in basic auth format`},\n        {Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Headers: malformed, Code: 400, BodyMatch: `Attempted access with malformed header, auth data not encoded correctly`},\n    }...)\n}\n```\n\nTests are defined using new `test` package `TestCase` structure, which allows you to define both http request details and response assertions. For example `{Method: \"GET\", Path: \"/\", Headers: validPassword, Code: 200}` tells to make a `GET` request to `/` path, with specified headers. After request is made, it will assert response status code with given value.\n\n```go\ntype TestCase struct {\n\tMethod, Path    string            `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tDomain          string            `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tProto           string            `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tCode            int               `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tData            interface{}       `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tHeaders         map[string]string `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tPathParams      map[string]string `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tCookies         []*http.Cookie    `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tDelay           time.Duration     `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tBodyMatch       string            `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tBodyMatchFunc   func([]byte) bool `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tBodyNotMatch    string            `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tHeadersMatch    map[string]string `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tHeadersNotMatch map[string]string `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tJSONMatch       map[string]string `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tErrorMatch      string            `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tBeforeFn        func()            `json:\"-\"`\n\tClient          *http.Client      `json:\"-\"`\n\n\tAdminAuth      bool `json:\",omitempty\"`\n\tControlRequest bool `json:\",omitempty\"`\n}\n```\n\n`Test` provides a test runner, which generate HTTP requests based on specification and does assertions. Most of the time you going to use `tykTestServer#Run(t *testing.T, test.TestCase...) (*http.Response, error)`function. Note that it use variadic number of arguments, so if you need to pass multiple test cases, pass it  like in example above: `[]test.TestCase{<tc1>,<tc2>}...`, with 3 dots in the end.\n\nAdditionally there is `RunEx` function, with exactly same definition, but internally it runs test cases multiple times (4 right now) with different combinations of `overrideDefaults` and `hotReload` options. This can be handy if you need to test functionality that tightly depends hot reload functionality, like reloading APIs, loading plugin bundles or listener itself.\n\nBoth `Run` and `RunEx` also return response and error of the last test case, in case if you need it.\n### Changing config variables\nIn lot of cases tests depend on various config variables. You can can update them directly on the gateway config object `Gw.GetConfig` doing:\n\n```go\n   ts := gateway.StartTest(nil)\n   defer ts.Close()\n    \n   // Obtains current config\n   currentConfig := ts.Gw.GetConfig()\n   // perform changes\n   currentConfig..HTTPProfile = true\n   // set new config\n   ts.Gw.SetConfig(currentConfig)\n   // in some cases will be needed a reload\n   ts.Gw.DoReload()\n``` \n\n```go\nconfig.Global.HttpServerOptions.OverrideDefaults = true\nconfig.Global.HttpServerOptions.SkipURLCleaning = true\ndefer resetTestConfig()\n```\n\n### Upstream test server\nYou may notice that default API already targets some upstream mock, created for testing purpose. Url of the upstream hold in `testHttpAny` variable, but in most cases you do not need it, because APIs created by default already embed it. By default this upstream mock will successfully respond to any url, and response will contain details of the request in the following format:\n\n```go\ntype testHttpResponse struct {\n    Method  string\n    Url     string\n    Headers map[string]string\n    Form    map[string]string\n}\n```\n\nNote that it include final request details, so, for example if you need to test URL rewriting functionality, URL of original request will differ from URL in response of upstream mock, and you can assert it with: BodyMatch: \"Url\":\"<assert-url>\". Also notice how we used simple BodyMatch string assertion to validation JSON response. \n\nThere is also few special URLs with specific behavior:\n- `/get` accepts only `GET` requests\n- `/post` accepts only `POST` requests\n- `/jwk.json` used for cases when JWK token downloaded from upsteram\n- `/ws` used for testing WebSockets\n- `/bundles` built in plugin bundle web server, more details below\n\n### Coprocess plugin testing\nIf you want use Python, Lua or GRPC plugins, you need bundle manifest file and scripts to ZIP file, upload them somewhere on external file webserver, and point Gateway to bundle location. \n\nOur test framework include built-in bundle file server, and for simplicity, you provide only content of the of the bundle files, and it will automatically server it as ZIP file. \n1. Create `map[string]string` object with file contents, where key is file name\n2. Call `registerBundle(\"<unique-plugin-id>\", <map-with-files>)` which will return unique bundle ID.\n3. When creating API set `spec.CustomMiddlewareBundle` to bundle ID returned by `registerBundle`\n\nExample of loading `python` auth plugin:\n\n```go\nvar pythonBundleWithAuthCheck = map[string]string{\n    \"manifest.json\": `\n        {\n            \"file_list\": [\n                \"middleware.py\"\n            ],\n            \"custom_middleware\": {\n                \"driver\": \"python\",\n                \"auth_check\": {\n                    \"name\": \"MyAuthHook\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    `,\n    \"middleware.py\": `\nfrom tyk.decorators import *\nfrom gateway import TykGateway as tyk\n@Hook\ndef MyAuthHook(request, session, metadata, spec):\n    print(\"MyAuthHook is called\")\n    auth_header = request.get_header('Authorization')\n    if auth_header == 'valid_token':\n        session.rate = 1000.0\n        session.per = 1.0\n        metadata[\"token\"] = \"valid_token\"\n    return request, session, metadata\n    `,\n}\n    \nfunc TestPython(t *testing.T) {\n     ts := gateway.StartTest(nil)\n     defer ts.Close()\n    \n    bundleID := ts.registerBundle(\"python_with_auth_check\", pythonBundleWithAuthCheck)\n\n    ts.Gw.buildAndLoadAPI(func(spec *APISpec) {\n        spec.UseKeylessAccess = false\n        spec.EnableCoProcessAuth = true\n        spec.CustomMiddlewareBundle = bundleID\n    })\n    // test code goes here\n}\n```\n\n### Creating user sessions\nYou can create a user session, similar to API, by calling `createSession` function:\n```go\n ts := gateway.StartTest(nil)\n defer ts.Close()\n\nkey := ts.Gw.createSession(func(s *user.SessionState) {\n    s.QuotaMax = 2\n})\n```\nYou can call it without arguments as well, if you are ok with default settings `createSession()`\n\nIf you need to create session object without adding it to database, for example if you need to create key explicitly via API, you can use `createStandardSession()` function, which returns `*user.SessionState` object.\n\n### Custom upstream mock\nIf you need to create custom upstream test server, for example if you need custom TLS settings for Mutual TLS testing, the easiest way is to use standard  Go `net/http/httptest` package and override `spec.Proxy.TargetURL` API URL to test server.\n\n```go\n ts := gateway.StartTest(nil)\n defer ts.Close()\n\nupstream := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        // custom logic\n}))\n\nts.Gw.buildAndLoadAPI(func(spec *APISpec) {\n    spec.Proxy.TargetURL = upstream.URL\n})\n```\n\n### Mocking dashboard\nThere is no any specific object to mock the dashboard (yet), but since Dashboard is a standard HTTP server, you can use approach similar to described in **Custom upstream mock** section:\n\n```go\n\n\ndashboard := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    if r.URL.Path == \"/system/apis\" {\n        w.Write([]byte(`{\"Status\": \"OK\", \"Nonce\": \"1\", \"Message\": [{\"api_definition\": {}}]}`))\n    } else {\n        t.Fatal(\"Unknown dashboard API request\", r)\n    }\n}))\n\nconf := func(confi *config.Config) {\n\t\tconfi.Global.UseDBAppConfigs = true\n        confi.Global.AllowInsecureConfigs = true\n        confi.Global.DBAppConfOptions.ConnectionString = dashboard.URL\n}\n\nts := gateway.StartTest(conf)\ndefer ts.Close()\n```\n\n### Mocking RPC (Hybrid)\nWhen Gateway works in Hybrid mode, it talks with MDCB instance via RPC channel using `gorpc` library. You can use `startRPCMock` and `stopRPCMock` functions to mock RPC server. `startRPCMock` internally sets required config variables to enable RPC mode.\n\n```go\nfunc TestSyncAPISpecsRPCSuccess(t *testing.T) {\n    // Mock RPC\n    dispatcher := gorpc.NewDispatcher()\n    dispatcher.AddFunc(\"GetApiDefinitions\", func(clientAddr string, dr *DefRequest) (string, error) {\n        return \"[{}]\", nil\n    })\n    dispatcher.AddFunc(\"Login\", func(clientAddr, userKey string) bool {\n        return true\n    })\n    rpc := startRPCMock(dispatcher)\n    defer stopRPCMock(rpc)\n    count := syncAPISpecs()\n    if count != 1 {\n        t.Error(\"Should return array with one spec\", apiSpecs)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### DNS mocks\nInside tests we override default network resolver to use custom DNS server mock, creating using awesome `github.com/miekg/dns` library. Domain -\\> IP mapping set via map inside `helpers_test.go` file. By default you have access to domains: `localhost`, `host1.local`, `host2.local` and `host3.local`. Access to all unknown domains will cause panic. \n\nUsing DNS mock means that you are able to create tests with APIs on multiple domains, without modifying machine `/etc/hosts` file. \n\n## Test Framework\n\nUsage of framework described above is not limited by Tyk Gateway, and it is used across variety of Tyk projects. \nThe main building block is the test runner. \n```go\ntype HTTPTestRunner struct {\n\tDo             func(*http.Request, *TestCase) (*http.Response, error)\n\tAssert         func(*http.Response, *TestCase) error\n\tRequestBuilder func(*TestCase) (*http.Request, error)\n}\nfunc (r HTTPTestRunner) Run(t testing.TB, testCases ...TestCase) {\n...\n}\n```\nBy overriding its variables, you can tune runner behavior.\nFor example http runner can be look like:\n```\nimport \"github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/test\"\n\n...\nbaseURL := \"http://example.com\"\nrunner := test.HTTPTestRunner{\n    Do: func(r *http.Request, tc *TestCase) (*http.Response, error) {\n      return tc.Client.Do(r)  \n    }\n    RequestBuilder: func(tc *TestCase) (*http.Request, error) {\n        tc.BaseURL = baseURL\n        return NewRequest(tc)\n    },\n}\nrunner.Run(t, testCases...)\n...\n```\nAnd Unit testing of http handlers can be:\n```\nimport \"github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/test\"\n\n...\nhandler := func(wr http.RequestWriter, r *http.Request){...}\nrunner := test.HTTPTestRunner{\n    Do: func(r *http.Request, _ *TestCase) (*http.Response, error) {\n\t\trec := httptest.NewRecorder()\n\t\thandler(rec, r)\n\t\treturn rec.Result(), nil\n\t},\n}\nrunner.Run(t, testCases...)\n...\n```\n\nThis package already exports functions for cases mentioned above:\n - `func TestHttpServer(t testing.TB, baseURL string, testCases ...TestCase)`\n - `func TestHttpHandler(t testing.TB, handle http.HandlerFunc, testCases ...TestCase)`\n"

Updating existing APIs that use a different naming convention will cause those APIs to be added, which could subsequently lead to a loading error and crash if they use the same listen_path. <br/>\n\n    These methods only work on a single API node.

Rate limiting at an organisation level is useful for creating tiered access levels and trial accounts.<br />\n\n    The Organisation rate limiting middleware works with both Quotas and Rate Limiters. In order to manage this functionality, a simple API has been put in place to manage these sessions. <br />\n\n    Although the Organisation session-limiter uses the same session object, all other security keys are optional as they are not used. <br />\n\n    <h3>Managing active status</h3> <br />\n\n    To disallow access to an entire group of keys without rate limiting the organisation, create a session object with the \"is_inactive\" key set to true. This will block access before any other middleware is executed. It is useful when managing subscriptions for an organisation group and access needs to be blocked because of non-payment. <br />\n  name: Organisation Quotas\n- description: |\n    Sometimes a cache might contain stale data, or it may just need to be cleared because of an invalid configuration.

It acts as a template that can override individual sections of an API key (or identity) in Tyk.\n  name: Policies\n- description: |\n    Manage OAuth clients, and manage their tokens\n  name: OAuth\n- description: |\n    Tyk supports batch requests, so a client makes a single request to the API but gets a compound response object back.\n    \n    This is especially handy if clients have complex requests that have multiple synchronous dependencies and do not wish to have the entire request / response cycle running for each event.\n    \n    To enable batch request support, set the `enable_batch_request_support` value to `true`\n    \n    Batch requests that come into Tyk are *run through the whole Tyk machinery* and *use a relative path to prevent spamming*. This means that a batch request to Tyk for three resources with the same API key will have three requests applied to their session quota and request limiting could become active if they are being throttled.\n    \n    Tyk reconstructs the API request based on the data in the batch request. This is to ensure that Tyk is not being used to proxy requests to other hosts outside of the upstream API being accessed.\n    \n    Batch requests are created by POSTING to the `/{listen_path}/tyk/batch/` endpoint. These requests **do not require a valid key**, but their request list does.\n    \n    <h3>Sample Request</h3>\n    \n        ```{json}\n        {\n          \"requests\": [\n            {\n              \"method\": \"GET\",\n              \"headers\": {\n                \"x-tyk-test\": \"1\",\n                \"x-tyk-version\": \"1.2\",\n                \"authorization\": \"1dbc83b9c431649d7698faa9797e2900f\"\n              },\n              \"body\": \"\",\n              \"relative_url\": \"get\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"method\": \"GET\",\n            \"headers\": {\n              \"x-tyk-test\": \"2\",\n              \"x-tyk-version\": \"1.2\",\n              \"authorization\": \"1dbc83b9c431649d7698faa9797e2900f\"\n            },\n            \"body\": \"\",\n            \"relative_url\": \"get\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"suppress_parallel_execution\": false\n        }\n        ```\n    \n    The response will be a structured reply that encapsulates the responses for each of the outbound requests. If `suppress_parallel_execution` is set to `true`, requests will be made synchronously. If set to `false` then they will run in parallel and the response order is not guaranteed.\n    \n    <h3>Sample Response</h3>\n    \n      ```\n      [\n        {\n          \"relative_url\": \"get\",\n          \"code\": 200,\n          \"headers\": {\n            \"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\": [\n              \"true\"\n            ],\n            \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": [\n              \"*\"\n            ],\n            \"Content-Length\": [\n              \"497\"\n            ],\n            \"Content-Type\": [\n              \"application/json\"\n            ],\n            \"Date\": [\n              \"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 15:32:43 GMT\"\n            ],\n            \"Server\": [\n              \"gunicorn/18.0\"\n            ],\n            \"Via\": [\n              \"1.1 vegur\"\n            ]\n          },\n          \"body\": \"{\n        \"args\": {},\n        \"headers\": {\n          \"Accept-Encoding\": \"gzip\",\n          \"Authorization\": \"1dbc83b9c431649d7698faa9797e2900f\",\n          \"Connect-Time\": \"2\",\n          \"Connection\": \"close\",\n          \"Host\": \"httpbin.org\",\n          \"Total-Route-Time\": \"0\",\n          \"User-Agent\": \"Go 1.1 package http\",\n          \"Via\": \"1.1 vegur\",\n          \"X-Request-Id\": \"6a22499a-2776-4aa1-80c0-686581a8be4d\",\n          \"X-Tyk-Test\": \"2\",\n          \"X-Tyk-Version\": \"1.2\"\n        },\n        \"origin\": \"127.0.0.1, 62.232.114.250\",\n        \"url\": \"http://httpbin.org/get\"\n      }\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"relative_url\": \"get\",\n            \"code\": 200,\n            \"headers\": {\n              \"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\": [\n                \"true\"\n              ],\n              \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": [\n                \"*\"\n              ],\n              \"Content-Length\": [\n                \"497\"\n              ],\n              \"Content-Type\": [\n                \"application/json\"\n              ],\n              \"Date\": [\n                \"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 15:32:43 GMT\"\n              ],\n              \"Server\": [\n                \"gunicorn/18.0\"\n              ],\n              \"Via\": [\n                \"1.1 vegur\"\n              ]\n            },\n            \"body\": \"{\n        \"args\": {},\n        \"headers\": {\n          \"Accept-Encoding\": \"gzip\",\n          \"Authorization\": \"1dbc83b9c431649d7698faa9797e2900f\",\n          \"Connect-Time\": \"7\",\n          \"Connection\": \"close\",\n          \"Host\": \"httpbin.org\",\n          \"Total-Route-Time\": \"0\",\n          \"User-Agent\": \"Go 1.1 package http\",\n          \"Via\": \"1.1 vegur\",\n          \"X-Request-Id\": \"1ab61f50-51ff-4828-a7e2-17240385a6d2\",\n          \"X-Tyk-Test\": \"1\",\n          \"X-Tyk-Version\": \"1.2\"\n        },\n        \"origin\": \"127.0.0.1, 62.232.114.250\",\n        \"url\": \"http://httpbin.org/get\"\n      }\"\n          }\n      ]\n      ```\n    With the body for each request string encoded in the `body` field.\n    \n    * `expire_analytics_after`: If you are running a busy API, you may want to ensure that your MongoDB database does not overflow with old data. Set the `expire_analytics_after` value to the number of seconds you would like the data to last for. Setting this flag to anything above `0` will set an `expireAt` field for each record that is written to the database.\n    \n    **Important:** Tyk will not create the expiry index for you. In order to implement data expiry for your analytics data, ensure that the index is created This is easily achieved using the [MongoDB command line interface](https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/client/).\n    \n    * `dont_set_quota_on_create`: This setting defaults to `false`, but if set to `true`, when the API is used to edit, create or add keys, the quota cache in Redis will not be re-set. By default, all updates or creates to Keys that have Quotas set will re-set the quota (This has been the default behaviour since 1.0).\n    \n      This behaviour can be bypassed on a case-by-case basis by using the `suppress_reset` parameter when making a REST API request. This is the advised mode of operation as it allows for manual, granular control over key quotas and reset timings.\n    \n    * `cache_options`: This section enables you to configure the caching behaviour of Tyk and to enable or disable the caching middleware for your API.\n    \n    * `cache_options.enable_cache`: Set this value to `true` if the cache should be enabled for this endpoint, setting it to false will stop all caching behaviour.\n    \n    * `cache_options.cache_timeout`: The amount of time, in seconds, to keep cached objects, defaults to `60` seconds.\n    \n    * `cache_options.cache_all_safe_requests`: Set this to `true` if you want all *safe* requests (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) to be cached. This is a blanket setting for APIs where caching is required but you don't want to set individual paths up in the definition.\n    \n    * `cache_options.enable_upstream_cache_control`: Set this to `true` if you want your application to control the cache options for Tyk (TTL and whether to cache or not). See [Caching](/docs/basic-config-and-security/reduce-latency/caching/) for more details.\n    \n    * `response_processors`: Response processors need to be specifically defined so they are loaded on API creation, otherwise the middleware will not fire. In order to have the two main response middleware components fire, the following configuration object should be supplied.\n    \n    ```{json}\n      \"response_processors\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"header_injector\",\n            \"options\": {\n                \"add_headers\": {\"name\": \"value\"},\n                \"remove_headers\": [\"name\"]\n            }\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"response_body_transform\",\n          \"options\": {}\n        }\n      ]\n    ```\n    \n    The options for the `header_injector` are global, and will apply to all outbound requests.\n  name: \"Batch requests\"\npaths:\n  /hello:\n    get:\n      description: From v2.7.5 you can now rename the `/hello`  endpoint by using\n        the `health_check_endpoint_name` option.\n      operationId: hello\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              example:\n                description: Tyk GW\n                details:\n                  redis:\n                    componentType: datastore\n                    status: pass\n                    time: \"2020-05-19T03:42:55+01:00\"\n                status: pass\n                version: v5.5.0-dev\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/HealthCheckResponse'\n          description: Success.\n        \"403\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              example:\n                message: Attempted administrative access with invalid or missing key!\n                status: error\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ApiStatusMessage'\n          description: Forbidden\n        \"405\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              example:\n                message: Method Not Allowed\n                status: error\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ApiStatusMessage'\n          description: Method Not Allowed\n      summary: Check the health of the Tyk Gateway.\n      tags:\n      - Health Checking\n  /tyk/apis:\n    get:\n      description: List APIs from Tyk Gateway\n      operationId: listApis\n      responses:\n        \"200\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              example:\n              - api_id: b84fe1a04e5648927971c0557971565c\n                auth:\n                  auth_header_name: authorization\n                definition:\n                  key: version\n                  location: header\n                name: Tyk Test API\n                org_id: 664a14650619d40001f1f00f\n                proxy:\n                  listen_path: /tyk-api-test/\n                  strip_listen_path: true\n                  target_url: https://httpbin.org\n                use_oauth2: true\n                version_data:\n                  not_versioned: true\n                  versions:\n                    Default:\n                      name: Default\n              schema:\n                items:\n                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/APIDefinition'\n                type: array\n          description: List of API definitions.\n        \"403\":\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              example:\n                message: Attempted administrative access with invalid or missing key!\n                status: error\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ApiStatusMessage'\n          description: Forbidden\n      summary: Get list of apis\n      tags:\n      - APIs\n    post:\n      description: Create API.
