We also recommend our users of [on-premise Bugsnag installations](https://www.bugsnag.com/on-premise) use Velero for [managing their own backups](https://docs.bugsnag.com/on-premise/clustered/backup-restore/). <!-- Velero.io word list : ignore -->\n\n**[Banzai Cloud][60]**  \n[Banzai Cloud Pipeline][61] is a Kubernetes-based microservices platform that integrates services needed for Day-1 and Day-2 operations along with first-class support both for on-prem and hybrid multi-cloud deployments. We use Velero to periodically [backup and restore these clusters in case of disasters][62].\n\n## Solutions built with Velero\n\nBelow is a list of solutions where Velero is being used as a component.\n\n**[Nirmata][10]**  \nWe have integrated our [solution with Velero][11] to provide our customers with out of box backup/DR.\n\n**[Kyma][40]**  \nKyma [integrates with Velero][41] to effortlessly back up and restore Kyma clusters with all its resources. Velero capabilities allow Kyma users to define and run manual and scheduled backups in order to successfully handle a disaster-recovery scenario.\n\n**[Red Hat][50]**  \nRed Hat has developed 2 operators for the OpenShift platform:\n- [Migration Toolkit for Containers][51] (Crane): This operator uses [Velero and Restic][52] to drive the migration of applications between OpenShift clusters.\n- [OADP (OpenShift API for Data Protection) Operator][53]: This operator sets up and installs Velero on the OpenShift platform, allowing users to backup and restore applications.\n\n**[Dell EMC][70]**  \nFor Kubernetes environments, [PowerProtect Data Manager][71] leverages the Container Storage Interface (CSI) framework to take snapshots to back up the persistent data or the data that the application creates e.g. databases. [Dell EMC leverages Velero][72] to backup the namespace configuration files (also known as Namespace meta data) for enterprise grade data protection.\n\n**[SIGHUP][80]**  \nSIGHUP integrates Velero in its [Fury Kubernetes Distribution][81] providing predefined schedules and configurations to ensure an optimized disaster recovery experience.\n[Fury Kubernetes Disaster Recovery Module][82] is ready to be deployed into any Kubernetes cluster running anywhere.\n\n**[MayaData][90]**  \nMayaData is a large user of Velero as well as a contributor. MayaData offers a Data Agility platform called [OpenEBS Director][91], that helps customers confidently and easily manage stateful workloads in Kubernetes. Velero is one of the core software building block of the OpenEBS Director's [DMaaS or data migration as a service offering][92] used to enable data protection strategies.\n\n**[Okteto][93]**  \nOkteto integrates Velero in [Okteto Cloud][94] and [Okteto Enterprise][95] to periodically backup and restore our clusters for disaster recovery. Velero is also a core software building block to provide namespace cloning capabilities, a feature that allows our users cloning staging environments into their personal development namespace for providing production-like development environments.\n\n**[Replicated][100]**<br>\nReplicated uses the Velero open source project to enable snapshots in [KOTS][101] to backup Kubernetes manifests & persistent volumes. In addition to the default functionality that Velero provides, [KOTS][101] provides a detailed interface in the [Admin Console][102] that can be used to manage the storage destination and schedule, and to perform and monitor the backup and restore process.<br>\n\n**[CloudCasa][103]**<br>\n[Catalogic Software][104] integrates Velero with [CloudCasa][103] - A Smart Home in the Cloud for Backups. CloudCasa is a full-featured, scalable, cloud-native solution providing Kubernetes data protection, disaster recovery, and migration as a service. An option to manage existing Velero instances and an enterprise self-hosted option are also available.<br>\n\n**[Microsoft Azure][105]**<br>\n[Azure Backup for AKS][106] is an Azure native, Kubernetes aware, Enterprise ready backup for containerized applications deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). AKS Backup utilizes Velero to perform backup and restore operations to protect stateful applications in AKS clusters.<br>\n\n## Adding your organization to the list of Velero Adopters\n\nIf you are using Velero and would like to be included in the list of `Velero Adopters`, add an SVG version of your logo to the `site/static/img/adopters` directory in this repo and submit a [pull request][3] with your change. Name the image file something that reflects your company (e.g., if your company is called Acme, name the image acme.png). See this for an example [PR][4].\n\n### Adding a logo to velero.io\n\nIf you would like to add your logo to a future `Adopters of Velero` section on [velero.io][2], follow the steps above to add your organization to the list of Velero Adopters. Our community will follow up and publish it to the [velero.io][2] website.\n\n[1]: #adding-a-logo-to-veleroio\n[2]: https://velero.io\n[3]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/pulls\n[4]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/pull/2242\n\n[10]: https://www.nirmata.com/2019/08/14/kubernetes-disaster-recovery-using-velero-and-nirmata/\n[11]: https://nirmata.com\n\n[20]: https://bitgo.com\n\n[30]: https://bugsnag.com\n\n[40]: https://kyma-project.io\n[41]: https://kyma-project.io/docs/components/backup/#overview-overview\n\n[50]: https://redhat.com\n[51]: https://github.com/fusor/mig-operator\n[52]: https://github.com/fusor/mig-operator/blob/master/docs/usage/2.md\n[53]: https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator\n\n[60]: https://banzaicloud.com\n[61]: https://banzaicloud.com/products/pipeline/\n[62]: https://banzaicloud.com/blog/vault-backup-velero/\n\n[70]: https://dellemc.com\n[71]: https://dellemc.com/dataprotection\n[72]: https://www.dellemc.com/resources/en-us/asset/briefs-handouts/solutions/h18141-dellemc-dpd-kubernetes.pdf\n\n[80]: https://sighup.io\n[81]: https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution\n[82]: https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-dr\n\n[90]: https://mayadata.io\n[91]: https://director.mayadata.io/\n[92]: https://help.mayadata.io/hc/en-us/articles/360033401591-DMaaS\n\n[93]: https://okteto.com\n[94]: https://cloud.okteto.com\n[95]: https://okteto.com/enterprise/\n\n[100]: https://www.replicated.com\n[101]: https://kots.io\n[102]: https://kots.io/kotsadm/snapshots/overview/\n\n[103]: https://cloudcasa.io/\n[104]: https://www.catalogicsoftware.com/\n\n[105]: https://azure.microsoft.com/\n[106]: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-overview\n"

This plugin is a volume snapshotter plugin that provides crash-consistent snapshots of vSphere block volumes and backup of volume data into S3 compatible storage.\n* **[Velero Plugin for AWS](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-aws):** This repository contains the plugins to support running Velero on AWS, including the object store plugin and the volume snapshotter plugin\n* **[Velero Plugin for GCP](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp):** This repository contains the plugins to support running Velero on GCP, including the object store plugin and the volume snapshotter plugin\n* **[Velero Plugin for Azure](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-microsoft-azure):** This repository contains the plugins to support running Velero on Azure, including the object store plugin and the volume snapshotter plugin\n* **[Velero Plugin Example](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-example):** This repository contains example plugins for Velero\n\n\n## Community Roles\n\n* **Users:** Members that engage with the Velero community via any medium (Slack, GitHub, mailing lists, etc.).\n* **Contributors:** Regular contributions to projects (documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participation in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc.). \n* **Maintainers**: The Velero project leaders. They are responsible for the overall health and direction of the project; final reviewers of PRs and responsible for releases. Some Maintainers are responsible for one or more components within a project, acting as technical leads for that component. Maintainers are expected to contribute code and documentation, review PRs including ensuring quality of code, triage issues, proactively fix bugs, and perform maintenance tasks for these components.\n\n### Maintainers\n\nNew maintainers must be nominated by an existing maintainer and must be elected by a supermajority of existing maintainers. Likewise, maintainers can be removed by a supermajority of the existing maintainers or can resign by notifying one of the maintainers.\n\n### Supermajority\n\nA supermajority is defined as two-thirds of members in the group.\nA supermajority of [Maintainers](#maintainers) is required for certain\ndecisions as outlined above. A supermajority vote is equivalent to the number of votes in favor being at least twice the number of votes against. For example, if you have 5 maintainers, a supermajority vote is 4 votes. Voting on decisions can happen on the mailing list, GitHub, Slack, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. Maintainers can either vote \"agree, yes, +1\", \"disagree, no, -1\", or \"abstain\". A vote passes when supermajority is met. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nIdeally, all project decisions are resolved by consensus. If impossible, any\nmaintainer may call a vote. Unless otherwise specified in this document, any\nvote will be decided by a supermajority of maintainers.\n\nVotes by maintainers belonging to the same company\nwill count as one vote; e.g., 4 maintainers employed by fictional company **Valerium** will\nonly have **one** combined vote. If voting members from a given company do not\nagree, the company's vote is determined by a supermajority of voters from that\ncompany. If no supermajority is achieved, the company is considered to have\nabstained.\n\n## Proposal Process\n\nOne of the most important aspects in any open source community is the concept\nof proposals. Large changes to the codebase and / or new features should be\npreceded by a proposal in our community repo. This process allows for all\nmembers of the community to weigh in on the concept (including the technical\ndetails), share their comments and ideas, and offer to help. It also ensures\nthat members are not duplicating work or inadvertently stepping on toes by\nmaking large conflicting changes.\n\nThe project roadmap is defined by accepted proposals.\n\nProposals should cover the high-level objectives, use cases, and technical\nrecommendations on how to implement. In general, the community member(s)\ninterested in implementing the proposal should be either deeply engaged in the\nproposal process or be an author of the proposal.\n\nThe proposal should be documented as a separated markdown file pushed to the root of the \n`design` folder in the [Velero](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/tree/main/design)\nrepository via PR. The name of the file should follow the name pattern `<short\nmeaningful words joined by '-'>_design.md`, e.g:\n`restore-hooks-design.md`.\n\nUse the [Proposal Template](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/design/_template.md) as a starting point.\n\n### Proposal Lifecycle\n\nThe proposal PR can follow the GitHub lifecycle of the PR to indicate its status:\n\n* **Open**: Proposal is created and under review and discussion.\n* **Merged**: Proposal has been reviewed and is accepted (either by consensus or through a vote).\n* **Closed**: Proposal has been reviewed and was rejected (either by consensus or through a vote).\n\n## Lazy Consensus\n\nTo maintain velocity in a project as busy as Velero, the concept of [Lazy\nConsensus](http://en.osswiki.info/concepts/lazy_consensus) is practiced. Ideas\nand / or proposals should be shared by maintainers via\nGitHub with the appropriate maintainer groups (e.g.,\n`@vmware-tanzu/velero-maintainers`) tagged. Out of respect for other contributors,\nmajor changes should also be accompanied by a ping on Slack or a note on the\nVelero mailing list as appropriate. Author(s) of proposal, Pull Requests,\nissues, etc.  will give a time period of no less than five (5) working days for\ncomment and remain cognizant of popular observed world holidays.\n\nOther maintainers may chime in and request additional time for review, but\nshould remain cognizant of blocking progress and abstain from delaying\nprogress unless absolutely needed. The expectation is that blocking progress\nis accompanied by a guarantee to review and respond to the relevant action(s)\n(proposals, PRs, issues, etc.) in short order.\n\nLazy Consensus is practiced for all projects in the `Velero` org, including\nthe main project repository and the additional repositories.\n\nLazy consensus does _not_ apply to the process of:\n\n* Removal of maintainers from Velero\n\n## Deprecation Policy\n\n### Deprecation Process\n\nAny contributor may introduce a request to deprecate a feature or an option of a feature by opening a feature request issue in the vmware-tanzu/velero GitHub project. The issue should describe why the feature is no longer needed or has become detrimental to Velero, as well as whether and how it has been superseded. The submitter should give as much detail as possible.\n\nOnce the issue is filed, a one-month discussion period begins. Discussions take place within the issue itself as well as in the community meetings. The person who opens the issue, or a maintainer, should add the date and time marking the end of the discussion period in a comment on the issue as soon as possible after it is opened. A decision on the issue needs to be made within this one-month period.\n\nThe feature will be deprecated by a supermajority vote of 50% plus one of the project maintainers at the time of the vote tallying, which is 72 hours after the end of the community meeting that is the end of the comment period. (Maintainers are permitted to vote in advance of the deadline, but should hold their votes until as close as possible to hear all possible discussion.) Votes will be tallied in comments on the issue. \n\nNon-maintainers may add non-binding votes in comments to the issue as well; these are opinions to be taken into consideration by maintainers, but they do not count as votes. \n\nIf the vote passes, the deprecation window takes effect in the subsequent release, and the removal follows the schedule. \n\n### Schedule\nIf depreciation proposal passes by supermajority votes, the feature is deprecated in the next minor release and the feature can be removed completely after two minor version or equivalent major version e.g., if feature gets deprecated in Nth minor version, then feature can be removed after N+2 minor version or its equivalent if the major version number changes.\n\n### Deprecation Window\n\nThe deprecation window is the period from the release in which the deprecation takes effect through the release in which the feature is removed. During this period, only critical security vulnerabilities and catastrophic bugs should be fixed.\n\n**Note:** If a backup relies on a deprecated feature, then backups made with the last Velero release before this feature is removed must still be restorable in version `n+2`. For instance, something like restic feature support, that might mean that restic is removed from the list of supported uploader types in version `n` but the underlying implementation required to restore from a restic backup won't be removed until release `n+2`.\n\n## Updating Governance\n\nAll substantive changes in Governance require a supermajority agreement by all maintainers.\n"

You can run Velero with a public cloud platform or on-premises. \n\nVelero lets you:\n\n* Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.\n* Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.\n* Replicate your production cluster to development and testing clusters.\n\nVelero consists of:\n\n* A server that runs on your cluster\n* A command-line client that runs locally\n\n## Documentation\n\n[The documentation][29] provides a getting started guide and information about building from source, architecture, extending Velero and more.\n\nPlease use the version selector at the top of the site to ensure you are using the appropriate documentation for your version of Velero.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues, review the [troubleshooting docs][30], [file an issue][4], or talk to us on the [#velero channel][25] on the Kubernetes Slack server.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are ready to jump in and test, add code, or help with documentation, follow the instructions on our [Start contributing][31] documentation for guidance on how to setup Velero for development.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [the list of releases][6] to find out about feature changes.\n\n### Velero compatibility matrix\n\nThe following is a list of the supported Kubernetes versions for each Velero version.\n\n| Velero version | Expected Kubernetes version compatibility | Tested on Kubernetes version        |\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 1.15           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.28.8, 1.29.8, 1.30.4 and 1.31.1   |\n| 1.14           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.27.9, 1.28.9, and 1.29.4          |\n| 1.13           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.26.5, 1.27.3, 1.27.8, and 1.28.3  |\n| 1.12           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.25.7, 1.26.5, 1.26.7, and 1.27.3  |\n| 1.11           | 1.18-latest                               | 1.23.10, 1.24.9, 1.25.5, and 1.26.1 |\n\nVelero supports IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack environments. Support for this was tested against Velero v1.8.\n\nThe Velero maintainers are continuously working to expand testing coverage, but are not able to test every combination of Velero and supported Kubernetes versions for each Velero release. The table above is meant to track the current testing coverage and the expected supported Kubernetes versions for each Velero version.\n\nIf you are interested in using a different version of Kubernetes with a given Velero version, we'd recommend that you perform testing before installing or upgrading your environment. For full information around capabilities within a release, also see the Velero [release notes](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases) or Kubernetes [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/CHANGELOG). See the Velero [support page](https://velero.io/docs/latest/support-process/) for information about supported versions of Velero.\n\nFor each release, Velero maintainers run the test to ensure the upgrade path from n-2 minor release.  For example, before the release of v1.10.x, the test will verify that the backup created by v1.9.x and v1.8.x can be restored using the build to be tagged as v1.10.x.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/workflows/Main%20CI/badge.svg\n[2]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/actions?query=workflow%3A\"Main+CI\"\n[4]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues\n[6]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases\n[9]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/\n[10]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-with-homebrew-on-macos\n[11]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#tabset-1\n[12]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/dns/README.md\n[14]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\n[24]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/projectvelero\n[25]: https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/velero\n[29]: https://velero.io/docs/\n[30]: https://velero.io/docs/troubleshooting\n[31]: https://velero.io/docs/start-contributing\n[100]: https://velero.io/docs/main/img/velero.png\n"

The community has adopted this security disclosure and response policy to ensure we responsibly handle critical issues.\n\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nThe Velero project maintains the following [governance document](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md), [release document](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/blob/f42c63af1b9af445e38f78a7256b1c48ef79c10e/site/docs/main/release-instructions.md), and [support document](https://velero.io/docs/main/support-process/). Please refer to these for release and related details. Only the most recent version of Velero is supported. Each [release](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases) includes information about upgrading to the latest version.\n\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability - Private Disclosure Process\n\nSecurity is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected security vulnerabilities should be reported to Velero privately, to minimize attacks against current users of Velero before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be investigated and patched on the next patch (or minor) release as soon as possible. This information could be kept entirely internal to the project.  \n\nIf you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability for Velero, please **IMMEDIATELY** contact the VMware Security Team (security@vmware.com).\n\n \n\n**IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities**\n\nTo report a vulnerability or a security-related issue, please contact the VMware email address with the details of the vulnerability. The email will be fielded by the VMware Security Team and then shared with the Velero maintainers who have committer and release permissions. Emails will be addressed within 3 business days, including a detailed plan to investigate the issue and any potential workarounds to perform in the meantime. Do not report non-security-impacting bugs through this channel. Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/new/choose) instead.\n\n\n## Proposed Email Content\n\nProvide a descriptive subject line and in the body of the email include the following information:\n\n\n\n*   Basic identity information, such as your name and your affiliation or company.\n*   Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability  (POC scripts, screenshots, and logs are all helpful to us).\n*   Description of the effects of the vulnerability on Velero and the related hardware and software configurations, so that the VMware Security Team can reproduce it.\n*   How the vulnerability affects Velero usage and an estimation of the attack surface, if there is one.\n*   List other projects or dependencies that were used in conjunction with Velero to produce the vulnerability.\n\n \n\n\n## When to report a vulnerability\n\n\n\n*   When you think Velero has a potential security vulnerability.\n*   When you suspect a potential vulnerability but you are unsure that it impacts Velero.\n*   When you know of or suspect a potential vulnerability on another project that is used by Velero.\n\n  \n\n\n## Patch, Release, and Disclosure\n\nThe VMware Security Team will respond to vulnerability reports as follows:\n\n \n\n\n\n1. The Security Team will investigate the vulnerability and determine its effects and criticality.\n2. If the issue is not deemed to be a vulnerability, the Security Team will follow up with a detailed reason for rejection.\n3. The Security Team will initiate a conversation with the reporter within 3 business days.\n4. If a vulnerability is acknowledged and the timeline for a fix is determined, the Security Team will work on a plan to communicate with the appropriate community, including identifying mitigating steps that affected users can take to protect themselves until the fix is rolled out.\n5. The Security Team will also create a [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) using the [CVSS Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0). The Security Team makes the final call on the calculated CVSS; it is better to move quickly than making the CVSS perfect. Issues may also be reported to [Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/) using this [scoring calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator). The CVE will initially be set to private.\n6. The Security Team will work on fixing the vulnerability and perform internal testing before preparing to roll out the fix.\n7. The Security Team will provide early disclosure of the vulnerability by emailing the [Velero Distributors](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/projectvelero-distributors) mailing list. Distributors can initially plan for the vulnerability patch ahead of the fix, and later can test the fix and provide feedback to the Velero team. See the section **Early Disclosure to Velero Distributors List** for details about how to join this mailing list. \n8. A public disclosure date is negotiated by the VMware SecurityTeam, the bug submitter, and the distributors list. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation or patch is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for distributor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it’s already publicly known) to a few weeks. For a critical vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect the report date for the public disclosure date to be on the order of 14 business days. The VMware Security Team holds the final say when setting a public disclosure date.\n9. Once the fix is confirmed, the Security Team will patch the vulnerability in the next patch or minor release, and backport a patch release into all earlier supported releases. Upon release of the patched version of Velero, we will follow the **Public Disclosure Process**.\n\n\n## Public Disclosure Process\n\nThe Security Team publishes a [public advisory](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/security/advisories) to the Velero community via GitHub. In most cases, additional communication via Slack, Twitter, mailing lists, blog and other channels will assist in educating Velero users and rolling out the patched release to affected users. \n\nThe Security Team will also publish any mitigating steps users can take until the fix can be applied to their Velero instances. Velero distributors will handle creating and publishing their own security advisories.\n\n \n\n\n## Mailing lists\n\n\n\n*   Use security@vmware.com to report security concerns to the VMware Security Team, who uses the list to privately discuss security issues and fixes prior to disclosure.\n*   Join the [Velero Distributors](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/projectvelero-distributors) mailing list for early private information and vulnerability disclosure. Early disclosure may include mitigating steps and additional information on security patch releases. See below for information on how Velero distributors or vendors can apply to join this list.\n\n\n## Early Disclosure to Velero Distributors List\n\nThe private list is intended to be used primarily to provide actionable information to multiple distributor projects at once. This list is not intended to inform individuals about security issues. \n\n\n## Membership Criteria\n\nTo be eligible to join the [Velero Distributors](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/projectvelero-distributors) mailing list, you should:\n\n\n\n1. Be an active distributor of Velero.\n2. Have a user base that is not limited to your own organization.\n3. Have a publicly verifiable track record up to the present day of fixing security issues.\n4. Not be a downstream or rebuild of another distributor.\n5. Be a participant and active contributor in the Velero community.\n6. Accept the Embargo Policy that is outlined below. \n7. Have someone who is already on the list vouch for the person requesting membership on behalf of your distribution.\n\n**The terms and conditions of the Embargo Policy apply to all members of this mailing list. A request for membership represents your acceptance to the terms and conditions of the Embargo Policy.**\n\n\n## Embargo Policy\n\nThe information that members receive on the Velero Distributors mailing list must not be made public, shared, or even hinted at anywhere beyond those who need to know within your specific team, unless you receive explicit approval to do so from the VMware Security Team. This remains true until the public disclosure date/time agreed upon by the list. Members of the list and others cannot use the information for any reason other than to get the issue fixed for your respective distribution's users.\n\nBefore you share any information from the list with members of your team who are required to fix the issue, these team members must agree to the same terms, and only be provided with information on a need-to-know basis.\n\nIn the unfortunate event that you share information beyond what is permitted by this policy, you must urgently inform the VMware Security Team (security@vmware.com) of exactly what information was leaked and to whom. If you continue to leak information and break the policy outlined here, you will be permanently removed from the list.\n\n \n\n\n## Requesting to Join\n\nSend new membership requests to projectvelero-distributors@googlegroups.com. In the body of your request please specify how you qualify for membership and fulfill each criterion listed in the Membership Criteria section above.\n\n\n## Confidentiality, integrity and availability\n\nWe consider vulnerabilities leading to the compromise of data confidentiality, elevation of privilege, or integrity to be our highest priority concerns. Availability, in particular in areas relating to DoS and resource exhaustion, is also a serious security concern. The VMware Security Team takes all vulnerabilities, potential vulnerabilities, and suspected vulnerabilities seriously and will investigate them in an urgent and expeditious manner.\n\nNote that we do not currently consider the default settings for Velero to be secure-by-default. It is necessary for operators to explicitly configure settings, role based access control, and other resource related features in Velero to provide a hardened Velero environment. We will not act on any security disclosure that relates to a lack of safe defaults. Over time, we will work towards improved safe-by-default configuration, taking into account backwards compatibility.\n"

Gaps in the restore process require users to manually carry out steps to start, clean up, and end the restore process. Other gaps in the restore process can cause issues with application performance for applications running in a pod when a restore operation is carried out. \n\nOn a restore, Velero currently does not include hooks to execute a pre- or -post restore script. As a result, users are required to perform additional actions following a velero restore operation. Some gaps that currently exist in the Velero restore process are:\n\n\n\n*   Users can create a restore operation but has no option to customize or automate commands during the start of the restore operation\n*   Users can perform post restore operations but have no option to customize or automate commands during the end of the restore operation\n\nStrategic Fit\n\nAdding a restore hook action today would allow Velero to unpack the data that was backed up in an automated way by enabling Velero to execute commands in containers during a restore. This will also improve the restore operations on a container and mitigate against any negative performance impacts of apps running in the container during restore.\n\nPurpose / Goal\n\nThe purpose of this feature is to improve the extensibility and user experience of pre and post restore operations for Velero users.\n\nGoals for this feature include:\n\n\n\n*   Enhance application performance during and following restore events \n*   Provide pre-restore hooks for customizing start restore operations\n*   Provide actions for things like retry actions, event logging, etc... during restore operations \n*   Provide observability/status of restore commands run in restored pods\n*   Extend restore logs to include status, error codes and necessary metadata for restore commands run during restore operations for enhanced troubleshooting capabilities \n*   Provide post-restore hooks for customizing end of restore operations\n*   Include pre-populated data that has been serialized by a Velero backup hook into a container or external service prior to allowing a restore to be marked as completed. \n\nNon-goals\n\nFeature Description\n\nThis feature will automate the restore operations/processes in Velero, and will provide restore hook actions in Velero that allows users to execute restore commands on a container. Restore hooks include pre-hook actions and post-hook actions.\n\nThis feature will mirror the actions of a Velero backup by allowing Velero to check for any restore hooks specified for a pod. \n\nAssumptions\n\n\n\n*   Restore operations will be run at the pod level instead of at the volume level. Some databases require the pod to be running and in some cases a user cannot manipulate a volume without the pod running. We need to support more than one type of database for this feature and so we need to ensure that this works broadly as opposed to providing support only for specific dbs. \n*   Velero will be responsible for invoking the restore hook. \n\n \n\nMVP Use Cases \n\nThe following use cases must be included as part of the Velero restore hooks MVP (minimum viable product). \n\n**Note: **Processing of concurrent vs sequential workloads is slated later in the Velero roadmap (see [https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/pull/2548/files](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/pull/2548/files)). The MVP for this feature set will align with restore of single workloads vs concurrent workload restores. A second epic will be created to address the concurrent restore operations and will be added to the backlog for priority visibility. \n\n**Note: **Please refer to the Requirements section of this document for more details on what items are P0 (must have in the MVP), P1 (should not ship without for the MVP), P2 (nice to haves).\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">USE CASE 1</span>**\n\n\n    **Title:** Run restore hook before pod restart.\n\n\n    **Description:  **As a user, I would like to run a restore hook before the applications in my pod are restarted.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">______________________________________________________________</span>**\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">USE CASE 2</span>**\n\n\n    **Title: **Allow restore hook to run on non-kubernetes databases\n\n\n    **Description: **As a user, I would like to run restore hook operations even on databases that are external to Kubernetes (such as postgres, elastic, etc…).\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">______________________________________________________________</span>**\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">USE CASE 3</span>**\n\n\n    **Title: **Run restore at pod level.\n\n\n    **Description: **As a user, I would like to make sure that I can run the restore hook at the pod level.

Verifying the integrity of a backup, resource, or other artifact will not be included in the scope of this effort. \n2. Verifying the integrity of a snapshot using Kubernetes hash checks.\n3. Running concurrent restore operations (for the MVP) a secondary epic will be opened to align better with the concurrent workload operations currently set on the Velero roadmap for Q4 timeframe. \n\n**Questions** \n\n\n\n1. For USE CASE 1:  Init vs app containers - if multiple containers are specified for a pod kubelet will run each init container sequentially - does this have an impact on things like concurrent workload processing? \n2. Can velero allow a user to specify a specific backup if the most recent backup is not desired in a restore?\n3. If a backup specified for a restore operation fails, can velero retry and pick up the next most recent backup in the restore?\n4. Can velero provide a delta between the two backups if a different backup needs to be picked up (other than the most recent because the most recent backup cannot be accessed?)\n5. What types of errors can velero surface about backups, namespaces, pods, resources, if a backup has an issue with it preventing a restore from being done? \n\n \n\nFor questions, please contact michaelmi@vmware.com,  [bstephanie@vmware.com](mailto:bstephanie@vmware.com) \n"
