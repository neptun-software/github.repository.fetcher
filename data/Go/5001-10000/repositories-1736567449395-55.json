This document outlines some of the conventions on\ndevelopment workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other\nresources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.\n\n# Certificate of Origin\n\nBy contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of\nOrigin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a\nsimple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the\ncontribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- Fork the repository on GitHub\n- Read the [README](README.md) for build and test instructions\n- Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!\n\n## Contribution Flow\n\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\n\n- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).\n- Make commits of logical units.\n- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).\n- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\n- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.\n- Submit a pull request to the original repository.\n\nThanks for your contributions!\n\n### Format of the Commit Message\n\nWe follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two\nquestions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and\nthe body of the commit should describe the why.\n\n```\nscripts: add the test-cluster command\n\nthis uses tmux to setup a test cluster that you can easily kill and\nstart for debugging.\n\nFixes #38\n```\n\nThe format can be described more formally as follows:\n\n```\n<subsystem>: <what changed>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<why this change was made>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<footer>\n```\n\nThe first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the\nsecond line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.\nThis allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various\ngit tools.\n"

Flannel does not control how containers are networked to the host, only how the traffic is transported between hosts. However, flannel does provide a CNI plugin for Kubernetes and a guidance on integrating with Docker.\n\nFlannel is focused on networking. For network policy, other projects such as [Calico][calico] can be used.\n\n## Getting started on Kubernetes\n\nThe easiest way to deploy flannel with Kubernetes is to use one of several deployment tools and distributions that network clusters with flannel by default. For example, [K3s][k3s] sets up flannel in the Kubernetes clusters it creates using the open source [K3s Installer][k3s-installer] to drive the setup process.\n\nThough not required, it's recommended that flannel uses the Kubernetes API as its backing store which avoids the need to deploy a discrete `etcd` cluster for `flannel`. This `flannel` mode is known as the *kube subnet manager*.\n\n### Deploying flannel manually\n\nFlannel can be added to any existing Kubernetes cluster though it's simplest to add `flannel` before any pods using the pod network have been started.\n\nFor Kubernetes v1.17+\n\n#### Deploying Flannel with kubectl\n\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/latest/download/kube-flannel.yml\n```\n\nIf you use custom `podCIDR` (not `10.244.0.0/16`) you first need to download the above manifest and modify the network to match your one.\n\n#### Deploying Flannel with helm\n\n```bash\n# Needs manual creation of namespace to avoid helm error\nkubectl create ns kube-flannel\nkubectl label --overwrite ns kube-flannel pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged\n\nhelm repo add flannel https://flannel-io.github.io/flannel/\nhelm install flannel --set podCidr=\"10.244.0.0/16\" --namespace kube-flannel flannel/flannel\n```\n\nSee [Kubernetes](Documentation/kubernetes.md) for more details.\n\nIn case a firewall is configured ensure to enable the right port used by the configured [backend][backends].\n\nFlannel uses `portmap` as CNI network plugin by default; when deploying Flannel ensure that the [CNI Network plugins][Network-plugins] are installed in `/opt/cni/bin` the latest binaries can be downloaded with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nARCH=$(uname -m)\n  case $ARCH in\n    armv7*) ARCH=\"arm\";;\n    aarch64) ARCH=\"arm64\";;\n    x86_64) ARCH=\"amd64\";;\n  esac\nmkdir -p /opt/cni/bin\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v1.6.0/cni-plugins-linux-$ARCH-v1.6.0.tgz\ntar -C /opt/cni/bin -xzf cni-plugins-linux-$ARCH-v1.6.0.tgz\n```\n\nFlannel requires the br_netfilter module to start and from version 1.30 kubeadm doesn't check if the module is installed and Flannel will not rightly start in case the module is missing.\n\n## Getting started on Docker\n\nflannel is also widely used outside of kubernetes. When deployed outside of kubernetes, etcd is always used as the datastore. For more details integrating flannel with Docker see [Running](Documentation/running.md)\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Building (and releasing)](Documentation/building.md)\n- [Configuration](Documentation/configuration.md)\n- [Backends](Documentation/backends.md)\n- [Running](Documentation/running.md)\n- [Troubleshooting](Documentation/troubleshooting.md)\n- [Projects integrating with flannel](Documentation/integrations.md)\n\n## Contact\n\n- Slack:\n  - #k3s on [Rancher Users Slack](https://slack.rancher.io)\n  - #flannel-users on [Calico Users Slack](https://slack.projectcalico.org)\n- Planning/Roadmap: [milestones][milestones], [roadmap][roadmap]\n- Bugs: [issues][flannel-issues]\n\n## Community Meeting\n\nThe Flannel Maintainer Community runs a meeting on every other Thursday at 8:30 AM PST. This meeting is used to discuss issues, open pull requests, and other topics related to Flannel should the need arise.\n\nThe meeting agenda and Teams link can be found here: [Flannel Community Meeting Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kPMMFDhljWL8_CUZajrfL8Q9sdntd9vvUpe-UGhX5z8)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING][contributing] for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.\n\n## Reporting bugs\n\nSee [reporting bugs][reporting] for details about reporting any issues.\n\n## Licensing\n\nFlannel is under the Apache 2.0 license.
