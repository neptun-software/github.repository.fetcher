          "content": "# Contributing\n\nExcited to hear that you are interested in contributing to this project! Thanks!\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is now being synced from the [`/docs`](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev/tree/main/docs) folder to the [`slidevjs/docs`](https://github.com/slidevjs/docs) repo.\n\nAll Pull Requests for documentation changes should still be made to this repository. Any merged changes will be automatically mirrored to the new documentation repo.\n\nThe easiest way to contribute documentation to this project is to follow these steps:\n\n1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo), for example to `https://github.com/octocat/slidev`, where `octocat` is your GitHub username.\n2. Clone the newly forked repo from your GitHub account\n3. Create a new branch to add your work to, i.e. `git checkout -b docs/update-contributing-guidelines`\n4. Make your changes and commit them\n5. Push the branch to your fork\n6. Go to [https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev/pulls](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev/pulls), there should be a \"Compare & Pull Request\" button, where you can create a PR.\n\n## Setup (in your browser)\n\nYou can contribute through a development environment in your browser by clicking the following button:\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev)\n\n## Setup (locally)\n\nThis project uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) to manage the dependencies, install it if you haven't via\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g pnpm\n```\n\nClone this repo to your local machine and install the dependencies.\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n```\n\n## Development\n\nTo build all the packages at once, run the following command on the project root\n\n```bash\npnpm build\n```\n\nBuild with watch mode\n\n```bash\npnpm dev\n```\n\n### Run Demo\n\nTo run Slidev locally, you can run\n\n```bash\npnpm demo:dev\n```\n\nOr with the real-world example `Composable Vue`:\n\n```bash\npnpm demo:composable-vue\n```\n\nThe server will restart automatically every time the builds get updated.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Monorepo\n\nWe use monorepo to manage multiple packages\n\n```\npackages\n  slidev/          - main package entry, holds the code on Node.js side\n  client/          - main frontend app\n  parser/          - parser for Slidev's extended Markdown format\n  create-app/      - scripts and template for `npm init slidev`\n  create-theme/    - scripts and template for `npm init slidev-theme`\n  theme-*/         - official themes\n```\n\n## Code Style\n\nDon't worry about the code style as long as you install the dev dependencies. Git hooks will format and fix them for you on committing.\n\n## Thanks\n\nThank you again for being interested in this project! You are awesome!\n"
