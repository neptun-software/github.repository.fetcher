Yes, now picom officially supports animations. For examples, and information on how to configure it, please go to our [documentation site](https://picom.app/#_animations). There are some video clips in #1253 as well. (#1220 #1253 #1303 #1305 #1308 #1310)\n* Universal window rules (#1284). One option to rule them all! Added new configuration option `rules` to replace all existing rule options, and to provide more flexibility on top of that. See [picom(1)](https://picom.app/#_window_rules) for more details. This can be used to configure per-window animations.\n* `@include` directives in config file now also search in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/picom/include` and `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/picom/include`, in addition to relative to the config file's parent directory.\n* Allow `corner-radius-rules` to override `corner-radius = 0`. Previously setting corner radius to 0 globally disables rounded corners. (#1170)\n* New `picom-inspect` tool, which lets you test out your picom rules. `man picom-inspect(1)` for more details. Sample output:\n\n  ```\n  ...\n  Checking rounded-corners-exclude:\n      window_type = \"dock\" ... not matched\n      window_type = \"desktop\" ... not matched\n      window_type *= \"menu\" ... not matched\n      fullscreen = 1 ... not matched\n  Checking opacity-rule:\n      _NET_WM_STATE@[0] *= \"_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN\" ... not matched\n  Checking corner-radius-rule:\n      class_g = \"Alacritty\" ... matched/10\n\n  Here are some rule(s) that match this window:\n      name = '[0.2.1] ./picom-inspect: ~/p/picom(./picom-inspect: ~/p/picom)*'\n      class_i = 'Alacritty'\n      class_g = 'Alacritty'\n      window_type = 'normal'\n      ! fullscreen\n      border_width = 0\n  ```\n* picom now has a rudimentary plugin system. At the moment, the only thing you can do with it is loading custom backends.\n\n## Notable changes\n\n* `override_redirect` in rules now only matches top-level windows that doesn't have a client window. Some window managers (e.g. awesome) set override_redirect for all window manager frame windows, causing this rule to match against everything (#625).\n* Marginally improve performance when resizing/opening/closing windows. (#1190)\n* Type and format specifiers are no longer used in rules. These specifiers are what you put after the colon (':') in rules, e.g. the `:32c` in `\"_GTK_FRAME_EXTENTS@:32c\"`. Now this information is ignored and the property is matched regardless of format or type.\n* `backend` is now a required option. picom will not start if one is not specified explicitly.\n* New predefined target for conditions: `group_focused`. This target indicate whether the focused window is in the same window group as the window being matched.\n* Meaning of `window_type` in conditions changed slightly, now it supports windows with multiple types. (However the behavior of `wintypes` remains unchanged.)\n\n## Deprecated features\n\n* Setting `--shadow-exclude-reg` is now a hard error. It was deprecated almost since the start of `picom`. `--clip-shadow-above` is the better alternative. (#1254)\n* Remove command line options `-n`, `-a`, and `-s`. They were removed more than 10 years ago, it's time to finally get rid of them entirely. (#1254)\n* Remove error message for `--glx-swap-method`, it was deprecated in v6.\n* Remove error message for passing argument to `--vsync` arguments, it was deprecated in v5.\n* Option `--opengl` is now deprecated, use `--backend=glx` instead.\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n* Fix ghosting artifacts that sometimes occur when window manager is restarted (#1081)\n* Fix a bug where rounded corner is disabled after making a window fullscreen and back (#1216)\n* Fix ugly looking rounded corners (#1261)\n\n## Build changes\n\n* picom now uses some OpenGL 4.3 features.\n* picom now optionally depends on `rtkit` at runtime to give itself realtime scheduling priority.\n* `libconfig` is now a mandatory dependency, with a minimal supported version of 1.7.\n* `xcb-dpms` is not needed anymore.\n* `libXext` is not needed anymore.\n* man pages are now built with asciidoctor, instead of asciidoc.\n\n## Behind the scene changes\n\n* The X critical section is removed, picom no longer grabs the server to fetch updates. Hopefully, if everything works, this change is unnoticeable. Minor responsiveness improvements could be possible, but I won't bet on it. The main point of this change is this makes debugging much less painful. Previously if you breaks inside the X critical section, the whole X server will lock up, and you would have to connect to the computer remotely to recover. Now there is no longer such worries. This also avoids a bug inside Xorg that makes server grabbing unreliable.\n\n# v11.2 (2024-Feb-13)\n\n## Build changes\n\n* `picom` now depends on `libepoxy` for OpenGL symbol management.\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n* Workaround a NVIDIA problem that causes high CPU usage after suspend/resume (#1172, #1168)\n* Fix building on OpenBSD (#1189, #1188)\n* Fix occasional freezes (#1040, #1145, #1166)\n* Fix `corner-radius-rules` not applying sometimes (#1177)\n* Fix window shader not having an effect when frame opacity is enabled (#1174)\n* Fix binding root pixmap in case of depth mismatch (#984)\n\n# v11.1 (2024-Jan-28)\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n* Fix missing fading on window close for some window managers. (#704)\n\n# v11 (2024-Jan-20)\n\n## Build changes\n\n* Due to some caveats discovered related to setting the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability, it is now recommended to **NOT** set this capability for picom.\n\n## Deprecations\n\n* Uses of `--sw-opti`, and `--respect-prop-shadow` are now hard errors.\n* `-F` has been removed completely. It was deprecated before the picom fork.\n\n# v11-rc1 (2024-Jan-14)\n\n## Notable features\n\n* picom now uses dithering to prevent banding. Banding is most notable when using a strong background blur. (#952)\n* Frame pacing. picom uses present feedback information to schedule new frames when it makes sense to do so. This improves latency, and replaces the `glFlush` and `GL_MaxFramesAllowed=1` hacks we used to do for NVIDIA. (#968 #1156)\n* Some missing features have been implemented for the EGL backend (#1004 #1007)\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n* Many memory/resource leak fixes thanks to @absolutelynothelix . (#977 #978 #979 #980 #982 #985 #992 #1009 #1022)\n* Fix tiling of wallpaper. (#1002)\n* Fix some blur artifacts (#1095)\n* Fix shadow color for transparent shadows (#1124)\n* Don't spam logs when another compositor is running (#1104)\n* Fix rounded corners showing as black with the xrender backend (#1003)\n* Fix blur with rounded windows (#950)\n\n## Build changes\n\n* Dependency `pcre` has been replaced by `pcre2`.\n* New dependency `xcb-util`.\n* `xinerama` is no longer used.\n* `picom` now tries to give itself a real-time scheduling priority. ~~Please consider giving `picom` the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability when packaging it.~~\n\n## Deprecations\n\n* The `kawase` blur method is removed. Note this is just an alias to the `dual_kawase` method, which is still available. (#1102)\n\n# Earlier versions\n\nPlease see the GitHub releases page.\n"

Mainly, people will report issues of this fork to the original compton, or report issues of the original compton here. Later, when distros started packaging this fork of compton, some wanted to differentiate the newer compton from the older version. They found themselves having no choice but to invent a name for this fork. This is less than ideal since this has the potential to cause more confusions among users.\n\nTherefore, we decided to move this fork to a new name. Personally, I consider this more than justified since this version of compton has gone through significant changes since it was forked.\n\n### The name\n\nThe criteria for a good name were\n\n0. Being short, so it's easy to remember.\n1. Pronounceability, again, helps memorability\n2. Searchability, so when people search the name, it's easy for them to find this repository.\n\nOf course, choosing a name is never easy, and there is no apparent way to objectively evaluate the names. Yet, we have to solve the aforementioned problems as soon as possible.\n\nIn the end, we picked `picom` (a portmanteau of `pico` and `composite`) as our new name. This name might not be perfect, but is what we will move forward with unless there's a compelling reason not to.\n\n\n# Compton\n\nThis is a copy of the README of the [original Compton project](https://github.com/chjj/compton/).\n\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/chjj/compton](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/chjj/compton?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n__Compton__ is a compositor for X, and a fork of __xcompmgr-dana__.\n\nI was frustrated by the low amount of standalone lightweight compositors.\nCompton was forked from Dana Jansens' fork of xcompmgr and refactored.  I fixed\nwhatever bug I found, and added features I wanted. Things seem stable, but don't\nquote me on it. I will most likely be actively working on this until I get the\nfeatures I want. This is also a learning experience for me. That is, I'm\npartially doing this out of a desire to learn Xlib.\n\n## Changes from xcompmgr:\n\n* OpenGL backend (`--backend glx`), in addition to the old X Render backend.\n* Inactive window transparency (`-i`) / dimming (`--inactive-dim`).\n* Titlebar/frame transparency (`-e`).\n* Menu transparency (`-m`, thanks to Dana).\n* shadows are now enabled for argb windows, e.g. terminals with transparency\n* removed serverside shadows (and simple compositing) to clean the code,\n  the only option that remains is clientside shadows\n* configuration files (see the man page for more details)\n* colored shadows (`--shadow-[red/green/blue]`)\n* a new fade system\n* VSync support (not always working)\n* Blur of background of transparent windows, window color inversion (bad in performance)\n* Some more options...\n\n## Fixes from the original xcompmgr:\n\n* fixed a segfault when opening certain window types\n* fixed a memory leak caused by not freeing up shadows (from the freedesktop\n  repo)\n* fixed the conflict with chromium and similar windows\n* [many more](https://github.com/chjj/compton/issues)\n\n## Building\n\n### Dependencies:\n\n__B__ for build-time\n\n__R__ for runtime\n\n* libx11 (B,R)\n* libxcomposite (B,R)\n* libxdamage (B,R)\n* libxfixes (B,R)\n* libXext (B,R)\n* libxrender (B,R)\n* libXrandr (B,R)\n* libXinerama (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_XINERAMA` at compile time)\n* pkg-config (B)\n* make (B)\n* xproto / x11proto (B)\n* sh (R)\n* xprop,xwininfo / x11-utils (R)\n* libpcre (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_REGEX_PCRE` at compile time)\n* libconfig (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_LIBCONFIG` at compile time)\n* libdrm (B) (Can be disabled with `NO_VSYNC_DRM` at compile time)\n* libGL (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_VSYNC_OPENGL` at compile time)\n* libdbus (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_DBUS` at compile time)\n* asciidoc (B) (and docbook-xml-dtd-4.5, libxml-utils, libxslt, xsltproc, xmlto, etc. if your distro doesn't pull them in)\n\n### How to build\n\nTo build, make sure you have the dependencies above:\n\n```bash\n# Make the main program\n$ make\n# Make the man pages\n$ make docs\n# Install\n$ make install\n```\n\n(Compton does include a `_CMakeLists.txt` in the tree, but we haven't decided whether we should switch to CMake yet. The `Makefile` is fully usable right now.)\n\n## Known issues\n\n* Our [FAQ](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/faq) covers some known issues.\n\n* VSync does not work too well. You may check the [VSync Guide](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/vsync-guide) for how to get (possibly) better effects.\n\n* If `--unredir-if-possible` is enabled, when compton redirects/unredirects windows, the screen may flicker. Using `--paint-on-overlay` minimizes the problem from my observation, yet I do not know if there's a cure.\n\n* compton may not track focus correctly in all situations. The focus tracking code is experimental. `--use-ewmh-active-win` might be helpful.\n\n* The performance of blur under X Render backend might be pretty bad. OpenGL backend could be faster.\n\n* With `--blur-background` you may sometimes see weird lines around damaged area. `--resize-damage YOUR_BLUR_RADIUS` might be helpful in the case.\n\n## Usage\n\nPlease refer to the Asciidoc man pages (`man/compton.1.asciidoc` & `man/compton-trans.1.asciidoc`) for more details and examples.\n\nNote a sample configuration file `compton.sample.conf` is included in the repository.\n\n## Support\n\n* Bug reports and feature requests should go to the \"Issues\" section above.\n\n* Our (semi?) official IRC channel is #compton on FreeNode.\n\n* Some information is available on the wiki, including [FAQ](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/faq), [VSync Guide](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/vsync-guide), and [Performance Guide](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/perf-guide).\n\n## License\n\nAlthough compton has kind of taken on a life of its own, it was originally\nan xcompmgr fork. xcompmgr has gotten around. As far as I can tell, the lineage\nfor this particular tree is something like:\n\n* Keith Packard (original author)\n* Matthew Hawn\n* ...\n* Dana Jansens\n* chjj and richardgv\n\nNot counting the tens of people who forked it in between.\n\nCompton is distributed under MIT license, as far as I (richardgv) know.

Like this:\n\n```bash\n$ LDFLAGS=\"-L/path/to/libraries\" CPPFLAGS=\"-I/path/to/headers\" meson setup --buildtype=release build\n```\n\nAs an example, on FreeBSD, you might have to run meson with:\n```bash\n$ LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\" CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/include\" meson setup --buildtype=release build\n$ ninja -C build\n```\n\n### To install\n\n``` bash\n$ ninja -C build install\n```\n\nDefault install prefix is `/usr/local`, you can change it with `meson configure -Dprefix=<path> build`\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nAll contributions are welcome!\n\nNew features you think should be included in picom, a fix for a bug you found - please open a PR!\n\nYou can take a look at the [Issues](https://github.com/yshui/picom/issues).\n\nContributions to the documents and wiki are also appreciated.\n\nEven if you don't want to add anything to picom, you are still helping by compiling and running this branch, and report any issue you can find.\n\n### Become a Collaborator\n\nBecoming a collaborator of picom requires significant time commitment. You are expected to reply to issue reports, reviewing PRs, and sometimes fix bugs or implement new feature. You won't be able to push to the main branch directly, and all you code still has to go through code review.\n\nIf this sounds good to you, feel free to contact me.\n\n## Contributors\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS)\n\nThe README for the [original Compton project](https://github.com/chjj/compton/) can be found [here](History.md#Compton).\n\n## Licensing\n\npicom is free software, made available under the [MIT](LICENSES/MIT) and [MPL-2.0](LICENSES/MPL-2.0) software\nlicenses.
