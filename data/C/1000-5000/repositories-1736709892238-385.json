Fix build issues with 3rd dependences.\n- 09/09/2014 - zimg 3.1.0 Release. New generation.\n- 04/26/2014 - zimg 2.0.0 Release. Supported distributed storage backends.\n- 08/01/2013 - zimg 1.0.0 Release.\n\n### Synopsis\n- The zimg is an image storage and processing server. You can get a compressed and scaled image from zimg with the parameters of URL.  \nhttp://demo.buaa.us/5f189d8ec57f5a5a0d3dcba47fa797e2?w=500&h=500&g=1&x=0&y=0&r=45&q=75&f=jpeg\n\n- The parameters contain width, height, resize type, gray, crop position (x, y), rotate, quality and format. And you can control the default type of images by configuration file.  \nAnd you can get the information of image in zimg server like this:  \nhttp://demo.buaa.us/info?md5=5f189d8ec57f5a5a0d3dcba47fa797e2\n\n- If you want to customize the transform rule of image you can write a zimg-lua script. Goto [API of zimg-lua](http://zimg.buaa.us/documents/api_of_zimg_lua/) for more information. Use `t=type` parameter in your URL to get the special image:  \nhttp://demo.buaa.us/5f189d8ec57f5a5a0d3dcba47fa797e2?t=webp500\n\n- The concurrent I/O, distributed storage and in time processing ability of zimg is excellent. You needn't nginx in your image server any more. In the benchmark test, zimg can deal with 3000+ image downloading task per second and 90000+ HTTP echo request per second on a high concurrency level. The performance is higher than PHP or other image processing server. More information of zimg is in the documents below.\n\n### Supplying:\nUploading, downloading and processing images through HTTP protocol.  \nHigh performance in concurrency I/O and compressing image.  \nSupport lua scripts to deal with customize compressing strategy.  \nSupport memcached and redis protocols to save images into distributed storage backends.  \nVaried config options for operation and maintenance.  \n\nMore usages are in [Guidebook of zimg](http://zimg.buaa.us/documents/guidebook/).\n\n### Build:\nYou should build dependences first. If you want to use distributed storage, make sure the optional storage backends beansdb(memcached protocol), or ssdb(redis protocol) is working well.  \nMore information of building zimg is in [Install Guide](http://zimg.buaa.us/documents/install/).\n \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/buaazp/zimg -b master --depth=1\ncd zimg   \nmake  \ncd bin  \n./zimg conf/zimg.lua\n```\n\n\n### Thanks to:\n> We stand on the shoulders of giants.  \n\n[libevhtp](https://github.com/ellzey/libevhtp): A more flexible replacement for libevent's httpd API.  \n[LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/): LuaJIT is JIT compiler for the Lua language.  \n[imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/): A software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images.  \n[hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis): Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.  \n[libmemcached](https://github.com/trondn/libmemcached): LibMemcached is designed to provide the greatest number of options to use Memcached.  \n\n**[Optional] For Storage:**\n\n[memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached): A distributed memory object caching system.  \n[beansdb](https://github.com/douban/beansdb): Beansdb is a distributed key-value storage system designed for large scale online system, aiming for high avaliablility and easy management.  \n[beanseye](https://github.com/douban/beanseye): Beanseye is proxy and monitor for beansdb, written in Go.  \n[SSDB](https://github.com/ideawu/ssdb): SSDB is a high performace key-value(key-string, key-zset, key-hashmap) NoSQL database, an alternative to Redis.  \n[twemproxy](https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy): Twemproxy is a fast and lightweight proxy for memcached and redis protocol.  \n\n\n### Documents:\nThere are several documents to introduce the design and architecture of zimg:  \n[Documents of zimg](http://zimg.buaa.us/documents/)  \nAnd this picture below shows the architecture of zimg's storage:  \n\n![architecture_of_zimg_v3](http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/large/4c422e03jw1ejjdk4vdccj20kf0momzd.jpg)\n\n### Download:\nThe source code is licensed under a BSD-like License.  \nAll versions on [Github](https://github.com/buaazp/zimg/releases).  \n\n### Feedback:\nIf you have any question, please submit comment in my [BLOG](http://blog.buaa.us/) or mention me on [Weibo](http://weibo.com/819880808), [twitter](https://twitter.com/buaazp).  \nTechnical issues are also welcomed to be submitted on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/buaazp/zimg/issues).\n\n\n"
