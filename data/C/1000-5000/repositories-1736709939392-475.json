It can be shown by this picture:  \n![Alt text](Misc/optics1.png?raw=true \"Image\")\n\nSome modeled pictures of the assembled Lidar can be found here: https://github.com/iliasam/OpenSimpleLidar/tree/master/Misc/Pictures/  \n\nSome more info: https://hackaday.io/project/20628-opensimplelidar  \n\nVideo of using OpenSimpleLidar for Autonomous Robot Navigation:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHt_NTktmlA\n\nSee also my previous LIDAR project: https://github.com/iliasam/OpenLIDAR  \nIf you need LIDAR with increased speed and range, see this project: https://github.com/iliasam/OpenTOFLidar  \n\nPlease leave your feedback if you will be able to build this Lidar - I need more feedback about assembing instructions.\n"
