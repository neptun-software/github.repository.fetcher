RTKLIB consists of a portable\nprogram library and several APs (application programs) utilizing the library.\nThe features of RTKLIB are:\n\n(1) It supports standard and precise positioning algorithms with:\n    \n    GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, BeiDou and SBAS\n    \n(2) It supports various positioning modes with GNSS for both real-time- and\n    post-processing:\n    \n    Single, DGPS/DGNSS, Kinematic, Static, Moving-Baseline, Fixed,\n    PPP-Kinematic, PPP-Static and PPP-Fixed.\n    \n(3) It supports many standard formats and protocols for GNSS:\n    \n    RINEX 2.10,2.11,2.12 OBS/NAV/GNAV/HNAV/LNAV/QNAV, RINEX 3.00,3.01,3.02\n    OBS/NAV,RINEX 3.02 CLK,RTCM ver.2.3,RTCM ver.3.1 (with amendment 1-5),\n    RTCM ver.3.2, BINEX, NTRIP 1.0, NMEA 0183, SP3-c, ANTEX 1.4, IONEX 1.0,\n    NGS PCV and EMS 2.0.\n    \n(4) It supports several GNSS receivers' proprietary messages:\n    \n    NovAtel: OEM4/V/6,OEM3,OEMStar,Superstar II, Hemisphere: Eclipse,Crescent,\n    u-blox: LEA-4T/5T/6T, SkyTraq: S1315F, JAVAD GRIL/GREIS, Furuno\n    GW-10-II/III and NVS NV08C BINR.\n    \n(5) It supports external communication via:\n    \n    Serial, TCP/IP, NTRIP, local log file (record and playback) and FTP/HTTP\n    (automatic download).\n    \n(6) It provides many library functions and APIs (application program\n    interfaces):\n    \n    Satellite and navigation system functions, matrix and vector functions,\n    time and string functions, coordinates transformation, input and output\n    functions, debug trace functions, platform dependent functions,\n    positioning models, atmosphere models, antenna models, earth tides models,\n    geoid models, datum transformation, RINEX functions, ephemeris and clock\n    functions, precise ephemeris and clock functions, receiver raw data\n    functions, RTCM functions, solution functions, Google Earth KML converter,\n    SBAS functions, options functions, stream data input and output functions,\n    integer ambiguity resolution, standard positioning, precise positioning,\n    post-processing positioning, stream server functions, RTK server\n    functions, downloader functions.\n    \n(7) It includes the following GUI (graphical user interface) and CUI\n    (command-line user interface) APs.\n    \n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Function                     GUI AP          CUI AP\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    (a) AP Launcher                  RTKLAUNCH       -\n    (b) Real-Time Positioning        RTKNAVI         RTKRCV\n    (c) Communication Server         STRSVR          STR2STR\n    (d) Post-Processing Analysis     RTKPOST         RNX2RTKP\n    (e) RINEX Converter              RTKCONV         CONVBIN\n    (f) Plot Solutions and Obs Data  RTKPLOT         -\n    (g) Downloder of GNSS Data       RTKGET          -\n    (h) NTRIP Browser                NTRIPSRCBROWS   -\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(8) All of the executable binary APs for Windows are included in the package as\n    well as whole source programs of the library and the APs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSYSTEM REQUIEREMENTS\n\nThe executable binary GUI and CUI APs included in the package require Microsoft\nWindows environment. On the other OS or environment, you have to compile and\nbuild CUI APs by yourself.\nAll of the library functions and APIs were written in ANSI C (C89). The library\ninternally uses winsock and WIN32 thread for Windows with the compiler option\n-DWIN32 and the standard socket and pthread (POSIX thread) for Linux/UNIX\nwithout any option. By setting the compiler option -DLAPACK or -DMKL, the\nlibrary uses LAPACK/BLAS [36] or Intel MKL for fast matrix computation. The CUI\nAPs were written in ANSI C. The library and CUI APs can be built on many\nenvironments like gcc on Linux. The GUI APs were written in C++ and utilize\nEmbarcadero/Borland VCL (visual component library) for GUI toolkits. All of the\nexecutable binary APs in the package were built by Embarcadero C++ builder XE2\nStarter Edition on Windows 7.\nThe executable GUI APs were tested on Windows 7 (64bit). The CUI APs were also\nbuilt and tested on Ubuntu 11.04 Linux and x86 CPU.\n\nNotes:\nPrevious versions of RTKLIB until ver. 2.4.1 were built by a free edition of\nBorland C++ (Turbo C++ 2006). Turbo C++, however, is no longer supported in\nver. 2.4.2 because of type incompatibility problem of GUI strings between\nver.2.4.2 and the previous ones.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLICENSE\n\nThe RTKLIB software package is distributed under the following BSD 2-clause\nlicense (http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) and additional two\nexclusive clauses.
