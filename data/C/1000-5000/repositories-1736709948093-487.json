The tool combines\nfast target execution with clever heuristics to find new execution paths in\nthe target binary. It has been successfully used to find a large number of\nvulnerabilities in real products. For more info about the original project,\nplease refer to the original documentation at:\n\nhttp://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/\n\nUnfortunately, the original AFL does not work on Windows due to very\n*nix-specific design (e.g. instrumentation, forkserver etc.). This project is\na fork of AFL that uses different instrumentation approach which works on\nWindows even for black box binary fuzzing.\n\n## The WinAFL approach\n\nInstead of instrumenting the code at compilation time, WinAFL supports the\nfollowing instrumentation modes:\n - Dynamic instrumentation using DynamoRIO (http://dynamorio.org/)\n - Dynamic instrumentation using TinyInst (https://github.com/googleprojectzero/TinyInst)\n - Hardware tracing using Intel PT\n - Static instrumentation via Syzygy\n\nThese instrumentation modes are described in more detail in the separate\ndocuments.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img alt=\"afl-fuzz.exe\" src=\"screenshots/afl-fuzz.gif\"/>\n</p>\n\nTo improve the process startup time, WinAFL relies heavily on persistent\nfuzzing mode, that is, executing multiple input samples without restarting the\ntarget process. This is accomplished by selecting a target function (that the\nuser wants to fuzz) and instrumenting it so that it runs in a loop.\n\n#### Known CVEs\n\nWinAFL has been successfully used to identify bugs in Windows software, such as the following:\n\n| Software | Bugs | Found by |\n| - | - | - |\n| Adobe | [CVE-2018-4985](https://cpr-zero.checkpoint.com/vulns/cprid-2046/),

If you are building with DynamoRIO support, download and build\nDynamoRIO sources or download DynamoRIO Windows binary package from\nhttps://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/releases\n\n2. If you are building with Intel PT support, pull third party dependencies by running `git submodule update --init --recursive` from the WinAFL source directory\n\n3. Open Visual Studio Command Prompt (or Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt\nif you want a 64-bit build). Note that you need a 64-bit winafl.dll build if\nyou are fuzzing 64-bit targets and vice versa.\n\n4. Go to the directory containing the source\n\n5. Type the following commands. Modify the -DDynamoRIO_DIR flag to point to the\nlocation of your DynamoRIO cmake files (either full path or relative to the\nsource directory).\n\n### For a 32-bit build:\n\n```\nmkdir build32\ncd build32\ncmake -G\"Visual Studio 16 2019\" -A Win32 .. -DDynamoRIO_DIR=C:\\path\\to\\DynamoRIO\\cmake -DINTELPT=1\ncmake --build . --config Release\n```\n\n### For a 64-bit build:\n\n```\nmkdir build64\ncd build64\ncmake -G\"Visual Studio 16 2019\" -A x64 .. -DDynamoRIO_DIR=C:\\path\\to\\DynamoRIO\\cmake -DINTELPT=1\ncmake --build . --config Release\n```\n\n### Build configuration options\n\nThe following cmake configuration options are supported:\n\n - `-DDynamoRIO_DIR=..\\path\\to\\DynamoRIO\\cmake` - Needed to build the\n   winafl.dll DynamoRIO client\n\n - `-DTINYINST=1` - Enable TinyInst mode. For more information see\n   https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl/blob/master/readme_tinyinst.md\n\n - `-DINTELPT=1` - Enable Intel PT mode. For more information see\n   https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl/blob/master/readme_pt.md\n\n - `-DUSE_COLOR=1` - color support (Windows 10 Anniversary edition or higher)\n\n - `-DUSE_DRSYMS=1` - Drsyms support (use symbols when available to obtain\n   -target_offset from -target_method). Enabling this has been known to cause\n   issues on Windows 10 v1809, though there are workarounds,\n   see https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl/issues/145\n\n## Using WinAFL\n\nThe command line for afl-fuzz on Windows is different than on Linux. Instead of:\n\n```\n%s [ afl options ] -- target_cmd_line\n```\n\nit now looks like this:\n\n```\nafl-fuzz [afl options] -- [instrumentation options] -- target_cmd_line\n```\n\nThe following afl-fuzz options are supported:\n\n```\n  -i dir        - input directory with test cases\n  -o dir        - output directory for fuzzer findings\n  -t msec       - timeout for each run\n  -s            - deliver sample via shared memory\n  -D dir        - directory containing DynamoRIO binaries (drrun, drconfig)\n  -w path       - path to winafl.dll\n  -e            - expert mode to run WinAFL as a DynamoRIO tool\n  -P            - use Intel PT tracing mode\n  -Y            - enable the static instrumentation mode\n  -f file       - location read by the fuzzed program\n  -m limit      - memory limit for the target process\n  -p            - persist DynamoRIO cache across target process restarts\n  -c cpu        - the CPU to run the fuzzed program\n  -d            - quick & dirty mode (skips deterministic steps)\n  -n            - fuzz without instrumentation (dumb mode)\n  -x dir        - optional fuzzer dictionary\n  -I msec       - timeout for process initialization and first run\n  -T text       - text banner to show on the screen\n  -M \\\\ -S id   - distributed mode\n  -C            - crash exploration mode (the peruvian rabbit thing)\n  -l path       - a path to user-defined DLL for custom test cases processing\n  -A module     - a module identifying a unique process to attach to\n```\n\nPlease refer to the original AFL documentation for more info on these flags.\n\nTo see the supported instrumentation flags, please refer to the documentation\non the specific instrumentation mode you are interested in (see \"Instrumentation modes\" below).\n\n## How does my target run under WinAFL\n\nWhen you select a target function and fuzz an application the following happens:\n\n1. Your target runs normally until your target function is reached.\n2. WinAFL starts recording coverage\n3. Your target function runs until return\n4. WinAFL reports coverage, rewrites the input file and patches EIP\n   so that the execution jumps back to step 2\n5. After your target function runs for the specified number of iterations,\n   the target process is killed and restarted. Note that anything that runs\n   after the target function returns is never reached.\n\n## How to select a target function\n\nThe target function should do these things during its lifetime:\n\n1. Open the input file. This needs to happen within the target function so\n   that you can read a new input file for each iteration as the input file is\n   rewritten between target function runs.\n2. Parse it (so that you can measure coverage of file parsing)\n3. Close the input file. This is important because if the input file is\n   not closed WinAFL won't be able to rewrite it.\n4. Return normally (So that WinAFL can \"catch\" this return and redirect\n   execution. \"returning\" via ExitProcess() and such won't work)\n\n## Instrumentation modes\n\nThe following documents provide information on using different instrumentation\nmodes with WinAFL:\n\n - [Dynamic instrumentation using DynamoRIO](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl/blob/master/readme_dr.md)\n - [Dynamic instrumentation using TinyInst](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl/blob/master/readme_tinyinst.md)\n - [Hardware tracing using Intel PT](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl/blob/master/readme_pt.md)\n - [Static instrumentation via Syzygy](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl/blob/master/readme_syzygy.md)\n\nBefore using WinAFL for the first time, you should read the documentation for\nthe specific instrumentation mode you are interested in. These also contain\nusage examples.\n\n## Attaching to a running process\n\nThe DynamoRIO instrumentation mode supports dynamically attaching to running processes. This option can be used to fuzz processes that cannot be directly launched by WinAFL, such as system services.\n\nTo use it, specify the `-A <module>` option to `afl-fuzz.exe`, where `<module>` is the name of a module loaded only by the target process (if the module is loaded by more than one process WinAFL will terminate).\n\nWinAFL will attach to the target process, and fuzz it normally. When the target process terminates (regardless of the reason), WinAFL will not restart it, but simply try to reattach. It is assumed that the target process will be restarted by an external script (or by the system itself). If WinAFL will not find the new target process within 10 seconds, it will terminate.\n\n## Sample delivery via shared memory\n\nWinAFL supports delivering samples via shared memory (as opposed to via a file, which is the default). This can be enabled by giving `-s` option to `afl-fuzz.exe`. Shared memory is faster and can avoid some problems with files (e.g. unable to overwrite the sample file because a target maintains a lock on it). \nIf you are using shared memory for sample delivery then you need to make sure that in your harness you specifically read data from shared memory instead of file. Check a simple harness here:\n\nhttps://github.com/googleprojectzero/Jackalope/blob/6d92931b2cf614699e2a023254d5ee7e20f6e34b/test.cpp#L41  \nhttps://github.com/googleprojectzero/Jackalope/blob/6d92931b2cf614699e2a023254d5ee7e20f6e34b/test.cpp#L111  \n\n## Corpus minimization\n\nWinAFL includes the windows port of afl-cmin in winafl-cmin.py. Please run the\nbelow command to see the options and usage examples:\n\n```\nD:\\Codes\\winafl>python winafl-cmin.py -h\n[...]\nExamples of use:\n * Typical use\n  winafl-cmin.py -D D:\\DRIO\\bin32 -t 100000 -i in -o minset -covtype edge -coverage_module m.dll -target_module test.exe -target_method fuzz -nargs 2 -- test.exe @@\n\n * Dry-run, keep crashes only with 4 workers with a working directory:\n  winafl-cmin.py -C --dry-run -w 4 --working-dir D:\\dir -D D:\\DRIO\\bin32 -t 10000 -i in -i C:\\fuzz\\in -o out_mini -covtype edge -coverage_module m.dll -target_module test.exe -target_method fuzz -nargs 2 -- test.exe @@\n\n * Read from specific file\n  winafl-cmin.py -D D:\\DRIO\\bin32 -t 100000 -i in -o minset -f foo.ext -covtype edge -coverage_module m.dll -target_module test.exe -target_method fuzz -nargs 2 -- test.exe @@\n\n * Read from specific file with pattern\n  winafl-cmin.py -D D:\\DRIO\\bin32 -t 100000 -i in -o minset -f prefix-@@-foo.ext -covtype edge -coverage_module m.dll -target_module test.exe -target_method fuzz -nargs 2 -- test.exe @@\n\n * Typical use with static instrumentation\n   winafl-cmin.py -Y -t 100000 -i in -o minset -- test.exe @@\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img alt=\"winafl-cmin.py\" src=\"screenshots/winafl-cmin.py.png\"/>\n</p>\n\n## Custom test cases processing\n\nWinAFL supports third party DLLs that can be used to define custom test-cases processing (e.g. to send test cases over network). To enable this option, you need to specify ```-l <path>``` argument.\nThe DLL should export the following two functions:\n```\ndll_init()\ndll_run(char *data, long size, int fuzz_iterations)\ndata - content of test case\nsize - size of test case\nfuzz_iterations - defines a current fuzzing iteration number\n```\n\nWe have implemented two sample DLLs for network-based applications fuzzing that you can customize for your own purposes.\n\n### Network fuzzing\n\nWinAFL's ```custom_net_fuzzer.dll``` allows winAFL to perform network-based applications fuzzing that receive and parse network data. There are several options supported by this DLL that should be provided via the environment variable ```AFL_CUSTOM_DLL_ARGS```:\n\n```\n  -a IP address - IP address to send data in\n  -U            - use UDP protocol instead of TCP to send data (default TCP)\n  -p port       - port to send data in\n  -w msec       - delay in milliseconds before actually start fuzzing\n```\nFor example, if your application receives network packets via UDP protocol at port 7714 you should set up the environment variable in the following way: ```set AFL_CUSTOM_DLL_ARGS=-U -p 7714 -a 127.0.0.1 -w 1000 ```\n\nYou still need to find target function and make sure that this function receives data from the network, parses it, and returns normally. Also, you can use In App Persistence mode described above if your application runs the target function in a loop by its own.\n\nAdditionally, this mode is considered as experimental since we have experienced some problems with stability and performance. However, we found this option very useful and managed to find several vulnerabilities in network-based applications (e.g. in Kollective Kontiki listed above).\n\nThere is a second DLL ```custom_winafl_server.dll``` that allows winAFL to act as a server and perform fuzzing of client-based applications. All you need is to set up the port to listen on for incoming connections from your target application. The environment variable ```AFL_CUSTOM_DLL_ARGS=<port_id>``` should be used for this purpose.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn case of server fuzzing, if the server socket has the `SO_REUSEADDR` option set like the following code, then this may case `10055` error after some time fuzzing due to the accumulation of `TIME_WAIT` sockets when WinAFL restart the fuzzing process. \n```\nsetsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, (char*)&opt, sizeof(int));\n```\n\nTo avoid this, replace the `SO_REUSEADDR` option by `SO_LINGER` option in the server source code if available.\n```\nsetsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_LINGER, (char*)&opt, sizeof(int));\n```\n\n## Custom mutators\n\nWinAFL supports loading a custom mutator from a third-party DLL.  You need to implement `dll_mutate_testcase` or `dll_mutate_testcase_with_energy` in your DLL and provide the DLL path to WinAFL via `-l <path>` argument.  WinAFL invokes the custom mutator before all the built-in mutations, and the custom mutator can skip all the built-in mutations by returning a non-zero value.  The `dll_mutate_testcase_with_energy` function is additionally provided an energy value that is equivalent to the number of iterations expected to run in the havoc stage without deterministic mutations. The custom mutator should invoke `common_fuzz_stuff` to run and make WinAFL aware of each new test case.  Below is an example mutator that increments every byte by one: \n\n```c\nu8 dll_mutate_testcase(char **argv, u8 *buf, u32 len, u8 (*common_fuzz_stuff)(char**, u8*, u32))\n{\n    u8 bailout = 0;\n    u8 *newbuf;\n    u32 i;\n    // duplicate the input buffer\n    newbuf = malloc(len);\n    if (!newbuf) return bailout;\n    memcpy(newbuf, buf, len);\n    // increment every byte by one and call common_fuzz_stuff for every new test case\n    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n       newbuf[i] += 1;\n       if (common_fuzz_stuff(argv, newbuf, len)) {\n           bailout = 1; // skip the rest of the mutation per common_fuzz_stuff\n           break;\n       }\n    }\n    free(newbuf);\n    return bailout;\n}\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n```\nQ: WinAFL reports timeouts while processing initial testcases.\nA: You should run your target in debug mode first (-debug flag) and only\n   run WinAFL once you get a message in the debug log that everything\n   appears to be running normally.\n\nQ: WinAFL runs slower than expected\nA: This can commonly happen for several reasons\n - Your target function loads a dll for every iteration. This causes\n   DynamoRIO to translate the same code for every iteration which causes\n   slowdowns. You will be able to see this in the debug log. To\n   resolve, select (or write) your target function differently.\n - Your target function does not close the input file properly, which\n   causes WinAFL to kill the process in order to rewrite it. Please refer to\n   \"How to select a target function\" for what a target function should look like.\n\nQ: Can I fuzz DLLs with WinAFL\nA: Yes, if you can write a harness that loads a library and runs some\n   function within. Write your target function according to \"How to select\n   a target function\" and for best performance, load the dll outside of\n   your target function (see the previous question).\n\nQ: Can I fuzz GUI apps with WinAFL\nA: Yes, provided that\n - There is a target function that behaves as explained in \"How to select\n   a target function\"\n - The target function is reachable without user interaction\n - The target function runs and returns without user interaction\n If these conditions are not satisfied, you might need to make custom changes\n to WinAFL and/or your target.\n```\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to Axel \"[0vercl0k](https://twitter.com/0vercl0k)\" Souchet of MSRC Vulnerabilities and\nMitigations Team for his contributions!\n"

          "content": "# Dynamorio Instrumentation mode\n\n## How it works\n\nThis mode relies on dynamic instrumentation using DynamoRIO\n(http://dynamorio.org/) to measure and extract target coverage. This approach\nhas been found to introduce an overhead about 2x compared to the native\nexecution speed, which is comparable to the original AFL in binary\ninstrumentation mode.\n\nIn order to use it you need to\n\n - download and build DynamoRIO sources or download DynamoRIO Windows binary\npackage from https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/wiki/Downloads\n\n - Specify the `-DDynamoRIO_DIR` option when building WinAFL\n\n## Supported instrumentation flags\n\nThe following instrumentation options are supported in the DynamoRIO mode:\n\n```\n  -covtype         - the type of coverage being recorded. Supported options are\n                     bb (basic block, default) or edge.\n\n  -coverage_module - module for which to record coverage. Multiple module flags\n                     are supported.\n\n  -target_module   - module which contains the target function to be fuzzed.\n                     Either -target_method or -target_offset need to be\n                     specified together with this option.\n\n  -target_method   - name of the method to fuzz in persistent mode. For this to\n                     work either the method needs to be exported or the symbols\n                     for target_module need to be available. Otherwise use\n                     -target_offset instead.\n\n  -target_offset   - offset of the method to fuzz from the start of the module.\n\n  -fuzz_iterations - Maximum number of iterations for the target function to run\n                     before restarting the target process.\n\n  -nargs           - Number of arguments the fuzzed method takes. This is used\n                     to save/restore the arguments between runs.\n\n  -call_convention - The default calling convention is cdecl on 32-bit x86\n                     platforms and Microsoft x64 for Visual Studio 64-bit\n                     applications. Possible values:\n                         * fastcall: fastcall\n                         * ms64: Microsoft x64 (Visual Studio)\n                         * stdcall: cdecl or stdcall\n                         * thiscall: thiscall\n\n  -debug           - Debug mode. Does not try to connect to the server. Outputs\n                     a log file containing loaded modules, opened files and\n                     coverage information.\n\n  -logdir          - specifies in which directory the log file will be written\n                     (only to be used with -debug).\n\n  -thread_coverage - If set, WinAFL will only collect coverage from a thread\n                     that executed the target function\n```\n\n## Using\n\nNote: If you are using pre-built binaries you'll need to download DynamoRIO\nrelease 7.1.0-1 from https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/wiki/Downloads.\nIf you built WinAFL from source, you can use whatever version of DynamoRIO\nyou used to build WinAFL.\n\nIn general, you should perform the following steps when fuzzing a new target:\n\n1. Make sure your target is running correctly without instrumentations.\n\n2. Open the target binary in WinDbg and locate the function you want to fuzz.\nNote the offset of the function from the start of the module. For example, if\nyou want to fuzz the main function and happen to have symbols around, you can\nuse the following windbg command:\n\n```\nx test!main\n```\n\n3. Make sure that the target is running correctly under DynamoRIO. For this\npurpose you can use the standalone debug mode of WinAFL client which does not\nrequire connecting to afl-fuzz. Make sure you use the drrun.exe and winafl.dll\nversion which corresponds to your target (32 vs. 64 bit).\n\nExample command line:\n\n```\npath\\to\\DynamoRIO\\bin64\\drrun.exe -c winafl.dll -debug\n-target_module test_gdiplus.exe -target_offset 0x16e0 -fuzz_iterations 10\n-nargs 2 -- test_gdiplus.exe input.bmp\n```\n\nYou should see the output corresponding to your target function being run 10\ntimes after which the target executable will exit. A .log file should be\ncreated in the current directory. The log file contains useful information\nsuch as the files and modules loaded by the target as well as the dump of AFL\ncoverage map. In the log you should see pre_fuzz_handler and post_fuzz_handler\nbeing run exactly 10 times as well as your input file being open in each\niteration. Note the list of loaded modules for setting the -coverage_module\nflag. Note that you must use the same values for module names as seen in the\nlog file (not case sensitive).\n\n4. Now you should be ready to fuzz the target. First, make sure that both\nafl-fuzz.exe and winafl.dll are in the current directory. As stated earlier,\nthe command line for afl-fuzz on Windows is:\n\n```\nafl-fuzz [afl options] -- [instrumentation options] -- target_cmd_line\n```\n\nPlease refer above for the list of supported AFL and instrumentation options.\n\nIn AFL options, you must specify the DynamoRIO binaries directory via the new\n-D option. You need to match the DynamoRIO and winafl.dll build (32 vs. 64 bit)\nto the target binary. -t (timeout) option is mandatory for WinAFL as execution\ntime can vary significantly under instrumentation so it's not a good idea to\nrely on the auto-determined values.\n\nYou can use the same WinAFL options as in step 2 but remember to exclude the\n-debug flag and you'll probably want to increase the iteration count.\n\nAs in afl-fuzz on Linux you can replace the input file parameter of the target\nbinary with @@.\n\nAn example command line would look like:\n\n```\nafl-fuzz.exe -i in -o out -D C:\\work\\winafl\\DynamoRIO\\bin64 -t 20000 --\n-coverage_module gdiplus.dll -coverage_module WindowsCodecs.dll\n-fuzz_iterations 5000 -target_module test_gdiplus.exe -target_offset 0x16e0\n-nargs 2 -- test_gdiplus.exe @@\n```\n\nAlternately, if symbols for test_gdiplus.exe are available, you can use\n-target_method instead of -target_offset like so:\n\n```\nafl-fuzz.exe -i in -o out -D C:\\work\\winafl\\DynamoRIO\\bin64 -t 20000 --\n-coverage_module gdiplus.dll -coverage_module WindowsCodecs.dll\n-fuzz_iterations 5000 -target_module test_gdiplus.exe -target_method main\n-nargs 2 -- test_gdiplus.exe @@\n```\n\nThat's it. Happy fuzzing!\n\n\n## In App Persistence mode\n\nThis feature is a tweak for the traditional \"target function\" approach and aims\nto loosen the requirements of the target function to do both reading\nan input file and processing the input file.\n\nIn some applications it's quite challenging to find a target function\nthat with a simple execution redirection won't break global states and will do\nboth reading and processing of inputs.\n\nThis mode assumes that the target application will actually loop\nthe target function by itself, and will handle properly its global state.\nFor example a udp server handling packets or a js interpreter running inside\na while loop.\n\nThis mode works as following:\n1. Your target runs until hitting the target function.\n2. The afl server starts instrumenting the target.\n3. Your target runs until hitting the target function again.\n4. The afl server stops instrumenting current cycle and starts a new one.\n\nUsage:\n\nAdd the following option to the winafl arguments:\n`-persistence_mode in_app`\n\n`-nargs` isn't necessary in this mode.\n\nExample usage on the supplied test.exe:\n\n```\nafl-fuzz.exe -i in -o out -D <dynamorio bin path> -t 100+ -- -coverage_module test.exe -fuzz_iterations 5000 -target_module test.exe -target_offset 0x1000 -persistence_mode in_app -- test.exe @@ loop\n```\n\n\n## Expert mode\n\nThe DynamoRIO client implemented in the `winafl.dll` can be packaged up with\nDynamoRIO to create an end-user tool, hence using `drrun` for WinAFL is made\nsimpler by the `-t` option. This is possible by running `afl-fuzz.exe` in\nexpert mode enabled by the `-e` switch.\n\nFirst, create a file in the `tools` subdirectory of the root of DynamoRIO called\n`winafl.drrun32` or `winafl.drrun64`, depending on the target architecture. The\n`CLIENT_REL` or `CLIENT_ABS` options enable `drrun` to locate the WinAFL client\nlibrary. This file can also modify the default DynamoRIO runtime options (see\nDynamoRIO Runtime Options) via `DR_OP=` lines. As an example for a 32-bit build,\nthis file should contain at least the following line:\n\n```\nCLIENT_REL=tools/lib32/release/winafl.dll\n```\n\nThe `-msgbox_mask` option controls whether DynamoRIO uses pop-up message boxes\nwhen presenting information. As an example, append the following lines to this\nfile to disable out of memory notices in case the target process reaches the\nmemory limit specified with the `-m` option:\n\n```\nDR_OP=-msgbox_mask\nDR_OP=0x0\n```\n\nTool options can also be specified via `TOOL_OP=` lines. As an example, append\nthe following lines to this file for a complete configuration to start fuzzing\nusing the supplied `test_gdiplus.exe`:\n\n```\nTOOL_OP=-covtype\nTOOL_OP=edge\nTOOL_OP=-coverage_module\nTOOL_OP=gdiplus.dll\nTOOL_OP=-fuzz_iterations\nTOOL_OP=1000\nTOOL_OP=-target_module\nTOOL_OP=test_gdiplus.exe\nTOOL_OP=-target_method\nTOOL_OP=main\nTOOL_OP=-nargs\nTOOL_OP=2\n```\n\nNow you can omit the client parameters from the command line as all the required\noptions are set in the tool configuration file.\n\nMake sure that the target is running correctly using WinAFL as a DynamoRIO tool:\n\n```\ndrrun.exe -t winafl -debug -- test_gdiplus.exe input.bmp\n```\n\nIf everything appears to be working correctly, launch `afl-fuzz.exe` in expert\nmode using the `-e` switch:\n\n```\nafl-fuzz.exe -e -i in -o out -D <dynamorio bin path> -t 100+ -- -- test_gdiplus.exe @@\n```\n"

          "content": "# WinAFL Intel PT mode\n\n## How it works\n\nIntel PT (Processor Tracing) is a feature on modern Intel CPUs that allows tracing code executed by the CPU. If the trace collection is enabled, the CPU generates a highly compressed trace of the instructions executed. This trace can be retrieved and decoded in software later.\n\nWindows from Windows 10 v1809 include an Intel PT driver. Although this is, at this time, undocumented and there is no official API, Alex Ionescu wrote the [WinIPT library](https://github.com/ionescu007/winipt) for interacting with it. This is what WinAFL uses for trace collection.\n\nWhen a target is fuzzed with WinAFL in Intel PT mode, WinAFL opens the target in a debugger. The debugger implenents the WinAFL persistence (looping over target function without the need to restart the process for every iteration), monitors for crashes, loaded modules etc. Before every iteration, the debugger enables Intel PT tracing for the target process and, after the iteration finishes, the trace is retrived and analyzed, updating the AFL coverage map.\n\n## Building and using\n\nTo build WinAFL with Intel PT support `-DINTELPT=1` must be added to the build options.\n\nTo use the Intel PT mode set the -P flag (without any arguments) instead of -D flag (for DynamoRIO) when calling afl-fuzz.exe. Intel PT tracing mode understands the same instrumentation flags as the [DynamoRIO mode](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl/blob/master/readme_dr.md), as well as several others:\n\n - `-trace_size <size>` The size (in bytes) of trace information to collect for every iteration. See remarks below. The size *must* be a factor of two larger than 4096.\n \n - `-decoder <decoder>` The decoder to use to process the trace. Supported options are `tip`, `tip_ref` and `full` (default). For more info, see the separate section on decoders below.\n \n - `-nopersistent_trace` By default, due to large performance hit associated, WinAFL will not restart tracing for each iteration. If this optimization ever causes problems, it can be turned off via this flag. Mostly here for debugging reasons.\n\n - `-trace_cache_size <size>` The size (in bytes) of trace cache. Used only in combination with the `full` decorer.\n\nLike the DynamoRIO mode, Intel PT mode also has the \"debug\" option which can be used to check if the target is running correctly under instrumentation. In general, before starting a new fuzzing session, you should use this to check if your instrumentation flags are correct for a given target. In the case of Intel PT mode, this is done via a separate binary, `winaflpt-debug.exe`. The usage is\n\n```\nwinaflpt-debug.exe -debug [instrumentation options] -- [target command line]\n```\n\nif the `-debug` flag is specified, `winaflpt-debug.exe` will generate a log file (`debug.log`) which contains information about how your target was running under instrumentation (specifically, which modules are loaded, how many iterations were executed etc.)\n\nExample:\n\n```\nwinaflpt-debug.exe -debug -coverage_module test.exe -fuzz_iterations 10 -target_module test.exe -target_method main -nargs 2 -- test.exe @@\n```\n\nWhen you verified that there weren't any problems in this step, you should be ready to fuzz your target. You can use the same instrumentation flags, but remember to remove the `-debug` flag and you'll probably want to increase the `-fuzz_iterations` count.\n\nFuzzing example:\n\n```\nafl-fuzz.exe -i testin -o testout -P -t 20000 -- -coverage_module test.exe -fuzz_iterations 2000 -target_module test.exe -target_method main -nargs 2 -- test.exe @@\n```\n\n## Limitations and other remarks\n\n - A relatively recent Intel CPU with the Processor Tracing feature is needed for this mode and Windows 10 v1809 is needed to be able to interact with it. Running WinAFL inside a VM won't work unless the VM software explicitly supports Intel PT.\n\n - The CPU writes trace information into a ring buffer. If the space in the ring buffer is not sufficient to store the full trace of the iteration execution, the buffer will wrap around and only the last `trace_size` bytes (or a little less, depending on the synchronization packets) will be available for processing. You should set the `trace_size` flags to be able to contain the full trace for a sample that exhibits full target behavior. The default `trace_size` should be sufficient for most targets, however reducing it might increase performance for small targets and you might want to increase it if you get trace buffer overflow warnings.\n \n - Currently, WinAFL will only record the trace from a thread that executes the target function. In most cases this is desirable, but not always. Currently, Intel PT driver does collect information from all threads and the debugger gets information about threads being created and threads exiting. However, when the debugger gets the EXIT_THREAD_DEBUG_EVENT, it is too late and the trace information for this thread is already lost. WinAFL could read out the trace while the thread is still running, however there would be a gap between the last time the trace was read out and the time the thread exited. This would result in a non-deterministic trace with a part of it cut off and, likely, not recording trace for very short threads. Thus, to address this problem deterministically, a better way of tracking thread exits is needed.\n\n## Decoders\n\nThe following trace decoders are available:\n \n - `full_ref` Uses [Intel's reference implementation](https://github.com/01org/processor-trace) to fully decode the trace. Note that full trace decoding introduces a significant overhead. Full trace decoding requires information about the code being executed. WinAFL accomplishes this by saving the memory from all executable modules in the process once they are loaded. However, if the instruction pointer ever ends up outside of an executable module (e.g. due to target using some kind of JIT), the decoding is going to fail and the trace will be decoded only partially. Additinally, if the target modifies executable modules on the fly, the result of the decoding is going to be unpredictable.\n\n - `full` (default) A custom decoder that adds a trace caching layer on top of Intel's reference decoder. Like the `full_ref` decoder it fully decodes all basic blocks in the trace (also provided that code is't generated / modified dynamically), but is significantly faster. For technical details on how this decoder works, see the separate section below.\n   \n - `tip_ref` Uses Intel's reference decoder implementation and decodes only the packets that contain the raw IP address (emitted for e.g. indirect jumps and calls, sometimes returns) but don't decode other packets, e.g. containing info about indirect jumps. This option does not require having any information on the code being executed and is much faster than full decoding. This is similar to how Intel PT is used in [Honggfuzz](https://github.com/google/honggfuzz).\n   \n - `tip` A faster custom implementation of the `tip_ref` decoder. It should behave the same as `tip_ref`\n\n## The fast full decoder\n\nNote: This section contains technical details about the `full` decoder, and is not a required reading if you are only interested in using WinAFL.\n\nThe \"fast\" decoder is in fact a caching layer on top of the Intel's reference decoder. It exploits the fact that, when fuzzing, most of the iterations (especially subsequent iterations) will have mostly identical coverage. At the same time, they won’t have completely identical coverage (due to e.g. not the same paths taken in allocators) or completely identical trace (due to e.g. asynchronous events occurring at different times). However, large parts of the trace are going to be the same.\n\nThe fast decoder splits the trace into parts (called tracelets) and processes each tracelet separately. When a tracelet is seen for the first time, it is processed using the reference decoder, and, on the high level, the following information is stored and cached:\n - the tracelet itself\n - decoder state before executing the tracelet\n - coverage corresponding to tracelet\n - decoder state after executing the tracelet\n\nNext time the same tracelet is seen *and* the decoder state is the same, coverage and the decoder state are updated from cache.\n\nNote however that traces can't be split into tracelets at random points, partly because of the reference decoder implementation details but also due to out-of-order packet feature of Intel PT: If the CPU has a TNT packet that is not full (and thus not yet sent), to save space CPU is also going to delay other packets (e.g. TIP packets) until the TNT packet gets filled. At the point when TNT packet gets filled, the TNT packet is going to get sent together with all delayed packets. To resolve this issue, tracelets are always cut *before* a TNT packet (which implies that the previous TNT packet was sent togerher with all the delayed packets). This approach seems to also play nicely with the reference decoder implementation.\n\nAnother issue that the decoder must solve is the return address compression: Intel PT expects the decoder to keep track of the call stack and, when the return instruction is encountered, if the actual return address matches the one on the decoder stack, instead of emitting the entire return address, Intel PT is only going to emit a single bit that indicates the return address should be taken from the decoder call stack. To support this feature, the \"fast\" decoder monitors call stack changes when the tracelet is first executed and the relevant changes are saved together with the \"before\" and \"after\" state. Specifically, each tracelet cache entry contains the data consumed from the stack during the traclet execution (these need to match the top of the decoder stack in order for the states to \"match\") and the values added to the stack during the tracelet execution (these are used to update the decoder state).\n"

Once the pass has transformed the binary, it passes it back\nto the framework which is able to _relink_ an output binary (with the transformations applied\nof course).\n\n[AFL instrumentation](https://github.com/google/syzygy/blob/master/syzygy/instrument/transforms/afl_transform.cc) has been added to [syzygy](https://github.com/google/syzygy)'s instrumenter allowing users to instrument PE32\nbinaries with private symbols statically.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img alt=\"afl instrumentation under IDA\" src=\"screenshots/afl-instr.png\"/>\n</p>\n\n## How to write a target function\n\nIn order to prepare your target, you need to first include `afl-staticinstr.h` then invoke `__afl_persistent_loop` like in `test_static.cpp`:\n\n```\nint fuzz(int argc, char**argv) {\n  while(__afl_persistent_loop()) {\n    test(argc, argv);\n  }\n  return 1;\n}\n```\n\n`__afl_persistent_loop`'s implementation lives inside `afl-staticinstr.c` and basically reproduces what the DynamoRIO plugin is doing in `pre_fuzz_handler` and `post_fuzz_handler`. Every points mentioned in \"How to select a target function\" applies here too.\n\nYou can invoke AFL tools with the flag `-Y` to enable the static instrumentation mode during fuzzing, corpus minimizing or during test-case minimizing:\n\n```\nafl-fuzz.exe -Y -i minset -o o1 -t 10000 -- -fuzz_iterations 5000 -- test_static.instr.exe @@\nwinafl-cmin.py -Y -t 100000 -i in -o minset -- test_static.instr.exe @@\nafl-tmin.exe -Y -i ..\\testcases\\tests\\big.txt -o big.min.txt -- test_static.instr.exe @@\n```\n\n## Building instrument.exe\n\nFor convenience, a version of instrument.exe confirmed to work with WinAFL is included in the bin32 directory. If you want to build it yourself follow the instructions below.\n\nIn order to clone [syzygy](https://github.com/google/syzygy/)'s repository you can follow the instructions outlined here: [SyzygyDevelopmentGuide](https://github.com/google/syzygy/wiki/SyzygyDevelopmentGuide).

          "content": "# TinyInst instrumentation\n\nTinyInst is a lightweight dynamic instrumentation library that can be used to instrument only selected module(s) in the process, while leaving the rest of the process to run natively. WinAFL includes a custom TinyInst client that can collect both basic block and edge coverage into an AFL coverage map.\n\n## Building and using\n\nTo build WinAFL with TinyInst support, `-DTINYINST=1` must be added to the build options. For the full building instructions, see the main readme.\n\nSimilar to other modes, the usage is\n\n```\nafl-fuzz -y [afl options] -- [instrumentation options] -- target_cmd_line\n```\n\nwhere the `-y` flag is used to select TinyInst mode.\n\nThe full list of instrumentation options can be found in the [TinyInst readme](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/TinyInst). Note that, while these options are mostly similar to instrumentation options in DynamoRIO mode:\n  - Some flags have differen names, e.g. `-instrument_module` (TinyInst) vs. `-coverage_module` (DynamoRIO).\n  - Some additional flags are needed to take advantage of persistence mode, specifically `-persist` and `-loop` flags.\n\nInstead of listing all of the options from TinyInst readme, let's examine a basic usage example\n\n```\nafl-fuzz.exe -y -i in -o out -t 20000 -- -instrument_module gdiplus.dll -instrument_module WindowsCodecs.dll -target_module test_gdiplus.exe -target_method main -nargs 2 -iterations 5000 -persist -loop -- C:\\work\\winafl\\build64\\bin\\RelWithDebInfo\\test_gdiplus.exe @@\n```\n\nwhich fuzzes the `test_gdiplus` harness included with WinAFL. As stated previously, `-y` is used to select the TinyInst mode. `-i in -o out -t 20000` are standard afl flags used to set input and output directories as well as the timeout, respectively.\n\n`-instrument_module` specifies which module to instrument. This is similar to `-coverage_module` flag in DynamoRIO mode. There can be multiple `-instrument_module` flags for different modules. In our example, we'll be instrumenting (collecting coverage from) two modules, `gdiplus.dll` and `WindowsCodecs.dll`\n\n`-target_module` and `-target_method` specify which function to run in WinAFL's persistent mode. `-target_module` identifies the module where the function is located (`test_gdiplus.exe` in the example), while `-target_method` specifies the name of the function (main in this case). In case where the symbols (function names) aren't available for the target module, `-target_offset` can be used instead, which specifies the offset in memory from start of the module to the target function (for example `-target_offset 0x16a0`).\n\n`nargs` specifies how many arguments the target function takes in order to be able to restore the arguments for every run.\n\n`-persist` instructs TinyInst to use the persistent mode and keep the target process alive when the target function returns.\n\n`-loop` instructs TinyInst to jump to the start of target function after it returns. `-persist` and `-loop` together enable the \"classic\" WinAFL persistent mode. However there might be cases where one of these flags is desirable without the other, for example in case where the target process calls the target function repeatedly on its own, `-persist` flag can be used without `-loop`\n\n`-iterations` specifies how many times to run the target function in persistent mode without restarting the target process.\n\nTo debug issues, it might be useful to run the target under TinyInst but without the fuzzer. This can be done using `litecov.exe` tool that comes with TinyInst. For example, running `litecov.exe` with the same instrumentation optios as above (except the number of iteration reduced)\n\n```\nlitecov.exe -instrument_module gdiplus.dll -instrument_module WindowsCodecs.dll -target_module test_gdiplus.exe -target_method main -nargs 2 -iterations 10 -persist -loop -- C:\\work\\winafl\\build64\\bin\\RelWithDebInfo\\test_gdiplus.exe in\\in.txt\n```\n\nmight produce the following output\n\n```\nInstrumented module gdiplus.dll, code size: 1409024\nTarget function returned normally\nFound 1094 new offsets in gdiplus.dll\nTarget function returned normally\nFound 1 new offsets in gdiplus.dll\nTarget function returned normally\nTarget function returned normally\nTarget function returned normally\nTarget function returned normally\nTarget function returned normally\nTarget function returned normally\nTarget function returned normally\nTarget function returned normally\n```\n\nThis lets us know that\n - There was code executing in the gdiplus.dll module and TinyInst collected some coverage from it.\n - The target function ran 10 times (as expected) and returned normally every time (i.e. no crashes or hangs)\n\nSo it gives us a good indication that the instrumentation options are set correctly and the target is running correctly under TinyInst.\n\nThere are additional flags that can be useful for debugging such as `-trace_debug_events` which, among other things, lists modules loaded by the target process. Note that `-trace_debug_events` might report exceptions in the target process, but these don't necessarily mean crashes or errors (as long as you don't see a message about the process crashing) as TinyInst uses exceptions under the hood.\n\n"
