Donations are highly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n**PayPal**\n\n- [**Choose what you want to donate**](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=2BDTFVEW9LFZY), all donations are awesome!\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nFFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever is a reimplementation of Android's MediaMetadataRetriever class. The FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever class provides a unified interface for retrieving frame and meta data from an input media file and uses FFmpeg as its backend.\n\nThis project uses FFmpeg version 4.2.2.\n\nKey Features:\n* ARMv7, x86, x86_64 and ARM_64 support (Note: ARM and MIPS aren't supported as of version 1.0.14)\n* Support for API 16+\n* URL support (Unlike MediaMetadataRetriever, see: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=35794)\n\nSupported protocols:\n* file, http, https, mms, mmsh and rtmp\n\nSupported formats (audio and video):\n* aac, acc+, avi, flac, mp2, mp3, mp4, ogg, 3gp and more!\n\nAdditional support for:\n* ICY Metadata (SHOUTcast metadata)\n\nDemo Application\n------------\n\nIf you would like to try FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever you can do so using the [Demo Application](https://github.com/wseemann/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/blob/master/FMMRDemo.apk)\n\nUsing FMMR in your application (Android Studio)\n------------\n\nAdd the following maven dependency to your project's `build.gradle` file:\n\n    dependencies {\n        implementation 'com.github.wseemann:FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever-core:1.0.19'\n        implementation 'com.github.wseemann:FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever-native:1.0.19'\n    }\n\nOptionally, to support individual ABIs:\n\n    dependencies {\n        implementation 'com.github.wseemann:FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever-core:1.0.19'\n        implementation 'com.github.wseemann:FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever-native-armeabi-v7a:1.0.19'\n        implementation 'com.github.wseemann:FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever-native-x86:1.0.19'\n        implementation 'com.github.wseemann:FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever-native-x86_64:1.0.19'\n        implementation 'com.github.wseemann:FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever-native-arm64-v8a:1.0.19'\n    }\n\nor, if your application supports individual architectures extract the appropriate AAR file into you projects \"libs\" folder:\n\n[Prebuilt AARs](https://github.com/wseemann/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/releases/download/v1.0.19/prebuilt-aars.zip)\n\nDemo Application\n------------\n\nA sample application that makes use of FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/wseemann/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/blob/master/FMMRDemo.apk?raw=true). Note: The sample application is compiled with support for ALL available formats. This results in a larger library and APK. FFmpeg can be recompiled with a subset of codecs enabled for those wanting a smaller size.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever relies on FFmpeg and native code. The build process\nis complex and may be confusing for those unfamiliar the Android NDK. For this\nreason I've precompiled AARs created by the build process and checked them\nin [here](https://github.com/wseemann/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/releases/download/v1.0.19/prebuilt-aars.zip).\nThe modules are also included with the library. If you don't want to build the modules\nyou can simple unzip the prebuilt ones and copy them to your projects \"libs\" folder. (Note:\ncopy them to YOUR projects \"libs\" folder, NOT the \"libs\" folder located in\nFFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever/fmmr-library. Once this step is complete you can use the\nlibrary (See: Installation in Eclipse (Kepler)). If you want to compile the modules yourself\nfollow the Ant instructions listed below before attempting to use the library.\n\nDownload and install the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).\nDownload the [Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html).\nClone/Download/Fork the repo through GitHub or via (read-only)\n\n    git clone https://github.com/wseemann/FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever.git\n\n### Android Studio (Gradle)\n\nNote: The build instructions and scripts assume you are running Unix or Linux. Building\non other operating systems is currently not supported.\n\nExecute the following in the root project directory (assuming /path/to/android_sdk/tools is in your PATH):\n\n    android update project --path .\n\nOpen the newly created local.properties file and add the following lines:\n\n    sdk.dir=<path to SDK>\n    ndk.dir=<path to NDK>\n\nwhere <path to SDK> is the path to your Android SDK, for example:\n\n    sdk.dir=/Users/wseemann/Library/Android/sdk\n\nwhere <path to NDK> is the path to your Android NDK, for example:\n\n    ndk.dir=/home/wseemann/Android/android-ndk-r20\n\nTo compile the library in Android Studio, highlight `core` in the project explorer and run Build->Make Module 'core'. This will also build the native FFmpeg binaries.\n\nUsage\n------------\n\nSample code:\n\n    FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever mmr = new FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever();\n    mmr.setDataSource(mUri);\n    mmr.extractMetadata(FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_ALBUM);\n    mmr.extractMetadata(FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_ARTIST);\n    Bitmap b = mmr.getFrameAtTime(2000000, FFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever.OPTION_CLOSEST); // frame at 2 seconds\n    byte [] artwork = mmr.getEmbeddedPicture();\n    \n    mmr.release();\n\nFFmpeg\n-----------\nThis software uses code of <a href=http://ffmpeg.org>FFmpeg</a> licensed under the <a href=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>LGPLv2.1</a> and its source can be downloaded <a href=https://www.ffmpeg.org/developer.html>here</a>.\n\nLicense\n------------\n\n```\nFFmpegMediaMetadataRetriever: A unified interface for retrieving frame \nand meta data from an input media file.\n\nCopyright 2022 William Seemann\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n"
