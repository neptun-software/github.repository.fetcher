packages must be\ninstalled before building:\n\n* [libre](https://github.com/baresip/re)\n* [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/)\n\nSee [Wiki: Install Stable Release](https://github.com/baresip/baresip/wiki/Install:-Stable-Release)\nor [Wiki: Install GIT Version](https://github.com/baresip/baresip/wiki/Install:-GIT-Version)\nfor a full guide.\n\n### Build with debug enabled\n\n```\n$ cmake -B build\n$ cmake --build build -j\n$ cmake --install build\n```\n\n### Build with release\n\n```\n$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \n$ cmake --build build -j\n```\n\n### Build with selected modules\n\n```\n$ cmake -B build -DMODULES=\"menu;account;g711\"\n$ cmake --build build -j\n```\n\n### Build with custom app modules\n\n```\n$ cmake -B build -DAPP_MODULES_DIR=../baresip-apps/modules -DAPP_MODULES=\"auloop;vidloop\"\n$ cmake --build build -j\n```\n\n### Build with clang compiler\n\n```\n$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++\n$ cmake --build build -j\n```\n### Build static\n\n```\n$ cmake -B build -DSTATIC=ON\n$ cmake --build build -j\n```\n\nModules will be built if external dependencies are installed.\nAfter building you can start baresip like this:\n\n```\n$ build/baresip\n```\n\nThe config files in `$HOME/.baresip` are automatically generated\nthe first time you run baresip.\n\n### Build documentation\n\nThe API documentation can be build using [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html).\n\n```\n$ doxygen mk/Doxyfile\n```\n\nBy default the documentation is written to `../baresip-dox`, if you want to\nchange the destination directory you can change the `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` in\n`mk/Doxyfile`.\n\n### Examples\n\n* Configuration examples are available in the\n[examples](https://github.com/baresip/baresip/tree/master/docs/examples)\ndirectory.\n* Documentation on configuring baresip can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/baresip/baresip/wiki/Configuration).\n\n## License\n\nThe baresip project is using the 3-clause BSD license.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPatches can be sent via Github\n[Pull-Requests](https://github.com/baresip/baresip/pulls) or to the Baresip\n[mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/g/baresip).\n\n\n## Design goals:\n\n* Minimalistic and modular VoIP client\n* SIP, SDP, RTP/RTCP, STUN/TURN/ICE\n* IPv4 and IPv6 support\n* RFC-compliancy\n* Robust, fast, low footprint\n* Portable C99 and C11 source code\n\n\n## Modular Plugin Architecture:\n```\naac
