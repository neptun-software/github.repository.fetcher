All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly\nand fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the\nreporter of any incident.\n\n## Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining\nthe consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of\nactions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent\nban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the\ncommunity.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.0, available at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by\n[Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

Please install them manually.\n\n- linux-tools-common\n- linux-tools-generic\n- pkgconf\n- libelf-dev\n\n## Compilation Commands\n\nIf you are just developing and testing locally, you can execute\n\n```\nmake build-bpf && make\n```\n\nthe kyanos executable file will be generated in the root directory of the\nproject.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>\n> Note that this binary file does not include the BTF files from\n> [btfhub-archive](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub-archive/). If you run\n> this kyanos on a lower version kernel without BTF support, it may fail to\n> start. You can build a kyanos artifact with embedded BTF files using the\n> following commands:  \n> x86_64:\n>\n> ```bash [x86_64]\n> make build-bpf && make btfgen BUILD_ARCH=x86_64 ARCH_BPF_NAME=x86 && make\n> ```\n>\n> arm64:\n>\n> ```bash [arm64]\n> make build-bpf && make btfgen BUILD_ARCH=arm64 ARCH_BPF_NAME=arm64 && make\n> ```\n>\n> Note that make btfgen may take more than 15 minutes.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> If your kernel does not have BTF enabled, you may not be able to start kyanos\n> successfully.\n>\n> Check if BTF is enabled:\n>\n> ```\n> grep CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF \"/boot/config-$(uname -r)\"\n> ```\n>\n> If the result is `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`, it means BTF is enabled. If not,\n> please download the BTF file corresponding to your kernel version from\n> [mirrors.openanolis.cn](https://mirrors.openanolis.cn/coolbpf/btf/) or\n> [btfhub-archive](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub-archive/), and use the\n> `--btf` option to specify the downloaded BTF file when starting kyanos.\n"

Kyanos\n   provides kernel trace points from the arrival of requests/responses at the\n   network card to the kernel socket buffer, displaying these details in a\n   visual format. This allows you to identify exactly which stage is causing\n   delays.\n\n![kyanos time detail](docs/public/timedetail.jpg)\n\n4. **Lightweight and Dependency-Free**: Almost zero dependencies—just a single\n   binary file and one command, with all results displayed in the command line.\n\n5. **Automatic SSL Traffic Decryption** : All captured requests and responses\n   are presented in plaintext.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Capture HTTP Traffic with Latency Details**\n\nRun the command:\n\n```bash\n./kyanos watch http\n```\n\nThe result is as follows:\n\n![kyanos quick start watch http](docs/public/qs-watch-http.gif)\n\n**Capture Redis Traffic with Latency Details**\n\nRun the command:\n\n```bash\n./kyanos watch redis\n```\n\nThe result is as follows:\n\n![kyanos quick start watch redis](docs/public/qs-redis.gif)\n\n**Identify the Slowest Requests in the Last 5 Seconds**\n\nRun the command:\n\n```bash\n ./kyanos stat --slow --time 5\n```\n\nThe result is as follows:\n\n![kyanos stat slow](docs/public/qs-stat-slow.gif)\n\n## ❗ Requirements\n\nKyanos currently supports kernel versions 3.10(from 3.10.0-957) and 4.14 or\nabove (with plans to support versions between 4.7 and 4.14 in the future).\n\n> You can check your kernel version using `uname -r`.\n\n## 🎯 How to get kyanos\n\nYou can download a statically linked binary compatible with amd64 and arm64\narchitectures from the\n[release page](https://github.com/hengyoush/kyanos/releases):\n\n```bash\ntar xvf kyanos_vx.x.x_linux_amd64.tar.gz\n```\n\nThen, run kyanos with **root privilege**:\n\n```bash\nsudo ./kyanos watch\n```\n\nIf the following table appears:\n![kyanos quick start success](docs/public/quickstart-success.png) 🎉\nCongratulations! Kyanos has started successfully.\n\n## 📝 Documentation\n\n[English Document](https://kyanos.io/)\n\n## ⚙ Usage\n\nThe simplest usage captures all protocols currently supported by Kyanos:\n\n```bash\nsudo ./kyanos watch\n```\n\nEach request-response record is stored as a row in a table, with each column\ncapturing basic information about that request. You can use the arrow keys or\n`j/k` to move up and down through the records:\n![kyanos watch result](docs/public/watch-result.jpg)\n\nPress `Enter` to access the details view:\n\n![kyanos watch result detail](docs/public/watch-result-detail.jpg)\n\nIn the details view, the first section shows **Latency Details**. Each block\nrepresents a \"node\" that the data packet passes through, such as the process,\nnetwork card, and socket buffer.  \nEach block includes a time value indicating the time elapsed from the previous\nnode to this node, showing the process flow from the process sending the request\nto the network card, to the response being copied to the socket buffer, and\nfinally read by the process, with each step’s duration displayed.\n\nThe second section provides **Detailed Request and Response Content**, split\ninto Request and Response parts, and truncates content over 1024 bytes.\n\nFor targeted traffic capture, such as HTTP traffic:\n\n```bash\n./kyanos watch http\n```\n\nYou can narrow it further to capture traffic for a specific HTTP path:\n\n```bash\n./kyanos watch http --path /abc\n```\n\nLearn more: [Kyanos Docs](https://kyanos.io/)\n\n## 🏠 How to build\n\n👉 [COMPILATION.md](./COMPILATION.md)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe Kyanos Roadmap shows the future plans for Kyanos. If you have feature\nrequests or want to prioritize a specific feature, please submit an issue on\nGitHub.\n\n_1.5.0_\n\n1. Support for openssl 3.4.0\n2. Support for parsing ipip packets\n3. Support for filtering data based on process name\n4. Support for postgresql protocol parsing\n5. Support for kafka protocol parsing\n6. Full support for ipv6\n\n## 🤝 Feedback and Contributions\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>\n> If you encounter any issues or bugs while using the tool, please feel free to\n> ask questions in the issue tracker.\n\n## 🙇‍ Special Thanks\n\nDuring the development of kyanos, some code was borrowed from the following\nprojects:\n\n- [eCapture](https://ecapture.cc/zh/)\n- [pixie](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie)\n- [ptcpdump](https://github.com/mozillazg/ptcpdump)\n\n## 🗨️ Contacts\n\nFor more detailed inquiries, you can use the following contact methods:\n\n- **Twitter:** [https://x.com/kyanos_github](https://x.com/kyanos_github)\n- **My Email:** [hengyoush1@163.com](mailto:hengyoush1@163.com)\n- **My Blog:** [http://blog.deadlock.cloud](http://blog.deadlock.cloud/)\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=hengyoush/kyanos&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#hengyoush/kyanos&Date)\n\n[Back to top](#top)\n"
