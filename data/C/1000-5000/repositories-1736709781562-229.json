          "content": "# Contributing to Apache AGE\n\nWelcome, future Contributor! \n\nFirst off, thank you for considering contributing to Apache AGE. Team AGE welcomes anyone who is willing to help us mature AGE to become a fully-featured graph database extension for PostgreSQL.\n\nThere are multiple ways you can contribute to the Apache AGE and [Apache AGE Viewer](https://github.com/apache/age-viewer) projects. We hope that adding features, fixing bugs, and changing documentations can be fun and educational for anyone and everyone. \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThe community members of Apache AGE are expected to follow the 'Apache Way'. Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct) provided by Apache Software Foundation.\n\n## How to Start\n\nA great way to get involved in the project is to ask questions on the mailing lists, Apache AGE Discord, or the Apache Reddit forum (r/apacheage). Reviewing the list of projects in the Apache AGE and AGE Viewer GitHubs may help you understand the overall roadmap. \n\nOnce you understand the ins and outs of Apache AGE, share your knowledge by helping the newcomers as well. Spending a few minutes to answer questions are a valuable open source community service, which also demonstrates your expertise. \n\nWe strongly recommend you to subscribe the mailing lists, join the Apache AGE Discord and Apache AGE Reddit community (r/apacheage) to keep up to date on what's happening in AGE. Visit [joinus](https://age.apache.org/joinus) for pathways you can follow to help you get started.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nChanges to AGE source code are proposed, reviewed, and committed via Github pull requests (described in Code Convention). Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository. Anyone can view and comment on active changes here. Reviewing others' changes are a good way to learn how the change process works and gain exposure to activity in various parts of the code. You can help by reviewing the changes, asking questions, or pointing out issues as simple as typos.\n\n## Documentation Changes\n\nYou can propose changes to Apache AGE documentation, edit the Markdown source files for the Apache AGE website pages. \n\n## Bug Reports\n\nIdeally, bug reports are accompanied by a proposed code change to fix the bug. This isn't always possible, as those who discover a bug may not have the experience to fix it. A bug may be reported by creating a GitHub issue, but without creating a pull request. \n\nBug reports are only useful, however, if they include enough information to understand, isolate and ideally reproduce the bug. Simply encountering an error does not mean a bug should be reported; search GitHub and inquire on the Apache AGE's dev mailing list first. Unreproducible bugs or simple error reports without context shall be closed. \n\nThe more context about a bug, the better, such as: how the bug was introduced, by which commit, etc. It assists the committers in the decision process on how far the bug fix should be backported, when the pull request is merged. The pull request to fix the bug should narrow down the problem to the root cause. Data correctness/data loss bugs are very serious. Make sure the corresponding bug report GitHub issue is labeled as correctness or data-loss. Please send an email to dev@age.apache.org after submitting the bug report, to quickly draw attention to the issue. Performance issues are classified as bugs. The pull request to fix a performance bug must provide a benchmark to prove the problem is indeed fixed.\n"

AGE is an acronym for A Graph Extension, and is inspired by Bitnine's fork of PostgreSQL 10, AgensGraph, which is a multi-model database. The goal of the project is to create single storage that can handle both relational and graph model data so that users can use standard ANSI SQL along with openCypher, the Graph query language. A graph consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and edges, where each individual vertex and edge possesses a map of properties. A vertex is the basic object of a graph, that can exist independently of everything else in the graph. An edge creates a directed connection between two vertices. A graph database is simply composed of vertices and edges. This type of database is useful when the meaning is in the relationships between the data. Relational databases can easily handle direct relationships, but indirect relationships are more difficult to deal with in relational databases. A graph database stores relationship information as a first-class entity.

AGE is an acronym for A Graph Extension and is inspired by Bitnine's AgensGraph, a multi-model database fork of PostgreSQL. The basic principle of the project is to create a single storage that handles both the relational and graph data model so that the users can use the standard ANSI SQL along with openCypher, one of the most popular graph query languages today. There is a strong need for cohesive, easy-to-implement multi-model databases. As an extension of PostgreSQL, AGE supports all the functionalities and features of PostgreSQL while also offering a graph model to boot.\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/img/age-01.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n</p>\n\n</br>\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/tick.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</h2>\n\nApache AGE is :\n\n- **Powerful**: adds graph database support to the already popular PostgreSQL database: PostgreSQL is used by organizations including Apple, Spotify, and NASA.\n- **Flexible**: allows you to perform openCypher queries, which makes complex queries much easier to write. It also enables querying multiple graphs at the same time.\n- **Intelligent**: allows you to perform graph queries that are the basis for many next-level web services such as fraud detection, master data management, product recommendations, identity and relationship management, experience personalization, knowledge management, and more.\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/features.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Features</h2>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/img/age-03.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n</p>\n</br>\n\n- **Cypher Query**: supports graph query language\n- **Hybrid Querying**: enables SQL and/or Cypher\n- **Querying**: enables multiple graphs\n- **Hierarchical**: graph label organization\n- **Property Indexes**: on both vertices(nodes) and edges\n- **Full PostgreSQL**: supports PG features\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/documentation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation</h2>\n\nRefer to our latest [Apache AGE documentation](https://age.apache.org/age-manual/master/index.html) to learn about installation, features, built-in functions, and  Cypher queries.\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/installation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Installation</h2>\n\nInstall the following essential libraries according to each OS. Building AGE from the source depends on the following Linux libraries (Ubuntu package names shown below):\n\n- **CentOS**\n```bash\nyum install gcc glibc glib-common readline readline-devel zlib zlib-devel flex bison\n```\n- **Fedora**\n```bash\ndnf install gcc glibc bison flex readline readline-devel zlib zlib-devel\n```\n- **Ubuntu**\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison\n```\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/installation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation</h2>\n\nApache AGE is intended to be simple to install and run. It can be installed with Docker and other traditional ways. \n\n<h4><a><img width=\"20\" src=\"/img/pg.svg\"></a>\n&nbsp;Install PostgreSQL\n</h4>\n\nYou will need to install an AGE compatible version of Postgres<a>, for now AGE supports Postgres 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16. Supporting the latest versions is on AGE roadmap.\n\n<h4>\n&nbsp;Installation via Package Manager\n</h4>\n\nYou can use a <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/download/\">package management </a> that your OS provides to download PostgreSQL.\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install postgresql\n\n```\n<h4>\n&nbsp;Installation From Source Code\n</h4>\n\nYou can <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/\"> download the Postgres </a> source code and install your own instance of Postgres. You can read instructions on how to install from source code for different versions on the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/installation.html\">official Postgres Website.</a>\n\n\n\n<h4><img width=\"20\" src=\"/img/tux.svg\"><img width=\"20\" src=\"/img/apple.svg\"> &nbsp;Install AGE on Linux and MacOS\n</h4>\n\nClone the <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/age\">github repository</a> or download the <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/age/releases\">download an official release.\n</a>\nRun the pg_config utility and check the version of PostgreSQL. Currently, only PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16 are supported. If you have any other version of Postgres, you will need to install PostgreSQL version 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16.\n<br>\n    \n```bash\npg_config\n```\nRun the following command in the source code directory of Apache AGE to build and install the extension.  \n     \n```bash\nmake install\n```\n     \nIf the path to your Postgres installation is not in the PATH variable, add the path in the arguments:\n```bash\nmake PG_CONFIG=/path/to/postgres/bin/pg_config install\n```\n\n\n<h4></a><img width=\"30\" src=\"/img/docker.svg\"></a>\n&nbsp;Run using Docker\n</h4>\n\n<h5> Get the docker image </h5>\n\n```bash\ndocker pull apache/age\n\n```\n<h5> Create AGE docker container </h5>\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n    --name age  \\\n    -p 5455:5432 \\\n    -e POSTGRES_USER=postgresUser \\\n    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgresPW \\\n    -e POSTGRES_DB=postgresDB \\\n    -d \\\n    apache/age\n```\n\n<h5> Enter PostgreSQL's psql: </h5>\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it age psql -d postgresDB -U postgresUser\n```\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"/img/contents.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Post Installation</h2>\n\nFor every connection of AGE you start, you will need to load the AGE extension.\n\n```bash\nCREATE EXTENSION age;\n```\n```bash\nLOAD 'age';\n```\n```bash\nSET search_path = ag_catalog, \"$user\", public;\n```\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"/img/contents.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick Start</h2>\n\nTo create a graph, use the create_graph function located in the ag_catalog namespace.\n\n```bash\nSELECT create_graph('graph_name');\n```\n\nTo create a single vertex with label and properties, use the CREATE clause.\n\n```bash\nSELECT * \nFROM cypher('graph_name', $$\n    CREATE (:label {property:\"Node A\"})\n$$) as (v agtype);\n```\n\n```bash\nSELECT * \nFROM cypher('graph_name', $$\n    CREATE (:label {property:\"Node B\"})\n$$) as (v agtype);\n```\n\nTo create an edge between two nodes and set its properties:\n\n```bash\nSELECT * \nFROM cypher('graph_name', $$\n    MATCH (a:label), (b:label)\n    WHERE a.property = 'Node A' AND b.property = 'Node B'\n    CREATE (a)-[e:RELTYPE {property:a.property + '<->' + b.property}]->(b)\n    RETURN e\n$$) as (e agtype);\n```\n\nAnd to query the connected nodes:\n\n```\nSELECT * from cypher('graph_name', $$\n        MATCH (V)-[R]-(V2)\n        RETURN V,R,V2\n$$) as (V agtype, R agtype, V2 agtype);\n```\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"/img/gettingstarted.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Language Specific Drivers</h2>\n\nStarting with Apache AGE is very simple. You can easily select your platform and incorporate the relevant SDK into your code.\n</br>\n</br>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/img/age-02.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>Built-in</h4>\n\n- [Go driver](./drivers/golang)\n- [Java driver](./drivers/jdbc)\n- [NodeJs driver](./drivers/nodejs)\n- [Python driver](./drivers/python)\n\n<h4>Community-driven Driver</h4>\n\n- [Apache AGE Rust Driver](https://github.com/Dzordzu/rust-apache-age.git)\n- [Apache AGE .NET Driver](https://github.com/Allison-E/pg-age)\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"/img/visualization.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Graph Visualization Tool for AGE</h2>\n\n\nApache AGE Viewer is a user interface for Apache AGE that provides visualization and exploration of data.\nThis web visualization tool allows users to enter complex graph queries and explore the results in graph and table forms.\nApache AGE Viewer is enhanced to proceed with extensive graph data and discover insights through various graph algorithms.\nApache AGE Viewer will become a graph data administration and development platform for Apache AGE to support multiple relational databases: <https://github.com/apache/age-viewer>.\n\n**This is a visualization tool.**\nAfter installing AGE Extension, you may use this tool to get access to the visualization features.\n\n\n![Viewer gdb, and graph](/img/agce.gif)\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"/img/videos.png\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Video Links</h2>\n\nYou can also get help from these videos. \n\n- Install on [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddk8VX8Hm-I&list=PLGp3huJbWNDjgwP7s99Q-9_w1vxpjNHXG)\n- Install on [MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-qMwpDh0CA)\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"/img/community.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributing</h2>\n\nYou can improve ongoing efforts or initiate new ones by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/apache/age).\nAlso, you can learn from the code review process, how to merge pull requests, and from code style compliance to documentation by visiting the [Apache AGE official site - Developer Guidelines](https://age.apache.org/contribution/guide).\nSend all your comments and inquiries to the user mailing list, users@age.apache.org.\n"
