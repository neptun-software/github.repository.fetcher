By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

This is so the PluginInfo struct is\n   zero'd first by Geany, so plugins are still ABI compatible if we\n   want to add any more fields in the future.\n   Fail to load a plugin if plugin_info->name is not set.\n   Remove now unused string.h include from plugindata.h.\n\n\n2008-05-22  Nick Treleaven  <nick(dot)treleaven(at)btinternet(dot)com>\n\n * src/templates.c, src/build.c, src/utils.c, src/ui_utils.h,\n   src/win32.c, src/utils.h, src/keybindings.c, src/printing.c,\n   src/tools.c, src/sciwrappers.c, src/project.c, src/sciwrappers.h,\n   src/encodings.c, src/prefs.c, src/dialogs.c, src/navqueue.c,\n   src/plugindata.h, src/geany.h, src/about.c, src/treeviews.c,\n   src/msgwindow.c, src/callbacks.c, src/notebook.c, src/keyfile.c,\n   src/filetypes.c, src/search.c, src/document.c, src/plugins.c,\n   src/main.c, src/editor.c, src/symbols.c, src/socket.c,\n   src/editor.h, src/ui_utils.c, plugins/export.c, plugins/vcdiff.c,\n   plugins/demoplugin.c, plugins/filebrowser.c, plugins/htmlchars.c,\n   plugins/autosave.c, plugins/pluginmacros.h, plugins/classbuilder.c:\n   Note: this commit breaks the plugin API.\n   Split widget fields out of GeanyApp into GeanyMainWidgets, so other\n   data items can be added without breaking the plugin ABI.\n   Add GeanyData::main_widgets, and macro.\n   Rename treeview_notebook sidebar_notebook in GeanyMainWidgets.\n   Move tools_menu from GeanyData to GeanyMainWidgets.\n   Move statusbar out of GeanyApp (shouldn't be used directly).\n   Move ignore_callback out of GeanyApp.\n   Rename sci_goto_line() argument unfold, like sci_goto_pos().\n   Make utils_goto_file_pos(), utils_goto_line(),\n   utils_switch_document() into static functions (they are UI-related,\n   so shouldn't be in utils.c).\n   Move utils_goto_pos() to editor.c, add mark argument.\n\n\n2008-05-21  Enrico Tröger  <enrico(dot)troeger(at)uvena(dot)de>\n\n * plugins/Makefile.am:\n   Specify the necessary libraries of each plugin to link against.\n * configure.in, win32-config.h, src/gb.c:\n   Fix some quotations to not screw up the bash lexer.\n   Don't use /dev/random or /dev/urandom in gb.c, instead of GLib's\n   random functions.\n\n\n2008-05-21  Nick Treleaven  <nick(dot)treleaven(at)btinternet(dot)com>\n\n * src/editor.c:\n   Refactor editor_auto_line_indentation().\n   Make Smart Line Indentation set the cursor to the beginning of\n   indentation for single line selections, so the user can fine-tune\n   indentation if necessary.

You should be aware of the open source licenses used - see\nthe README file or the documentation. It is reStructuredText; the\nsource file is HACKING.\n\nYou can generate this file by:\n\n* Passing the *--enable-html-docs* option to ``configure``.\n* Running ``make`` from the doc/ subdirectory.\n\nWriting plugins\n---------------\n* src/plugindata.h contains the plugin API data types.\n* See plugins/demoplugin.c for a very basic example plugin.\n* src/plugins.c loads and unloads plugins (you shouldn't need to read\n  this really).\n* The API documentation contains a few basic guidelines and hints to\n  write plugins.\n\nYou should generate and read the plugin API documentation, see below.\n\nPlugin API documentation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nYou can generate documentation for the plugin API using the doxygen\ntool:\n\n* Pass the *--enable-api-docs* option to ``configure``.\n* Run ``make`` from the doc/ subdirectory.\n\nThe documentation will be output to doc/reference/index.html.\nAlternatively you can view the API documentation online at\nhttps://www.geany.org/manual/reference/.\n\nPull requests\n-------------\nMaking pull requests on Github is the preferred way of contributing for geany.\n\n.. note:: For helping you to get started: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo\n\nSee `Rules to contribute`_ for more information.\n\nPatches\n-------\nWe are happy to receive patches, but the preferred way is to make a pull\nrequest on our Github repository. If you don't want to make a pull request,\nyou can send your patches on the devel mailing list, but the rules are the same:\nsee `Rules to contribute`_ for more information.\n\nIn general it's best to provide git-formatted patches made from the\ncurrent Git (see `Committing`_)::\n\n    $ git commit -a\n    $ git format-patch HEAD^\n\nWe also accept patches against other releases, but it's more work for us.\n\nIf you're not using Git, although you're strongly suggested to use it,\nyou can use the diff command::\n\n    $ diff -u originalpath modifiedpath > new-feature.patch\n\nHowever, such a patch won't contain the authoring information nor the\npatch's description.\n\n.. note::\n    Please make sure patches follow the style of existing code - In\n    particular, use tabs for indentation. See `Coding`_.\n\nRules to contribute\n-------------------\n\nKeep in mind this is best to check with us by email on mailing list\nwhether a new feature is appropriate and whether someone is already\nworking on similar code.\n\nPlease, make sure contributions you make follow these rules:\n\n* changes should be made in a dedicated branch for pull requests.\n* only one feature should be in each pull request (or patch).\n* pull requests (or patches) should not contain changes unrelated to the feature,\n  and commits should be sensible units of change.\n* the submitter should squash together corrections that are part of\n  the development process, especially correcting your own mistakes.\n* Please make sure your modifications follow the style of existing code:\n  see `Coding`_ for more information.\n\nSee `Committing`_ for more information.\n\nWindows tools\n-------------\n* Git: https://git-scm.com/ and https://gitforwindows.org/\n* diff, grep, etc: https://www.msys2.org/ or https://unxutils.sourceforge.net/\n\nSee also the Geany wiki on how to build Geany on Windows at https://wiki.geany.org/howtos/win32/msys2.\n\nFile organization\n-----------------\ncallbacks.c is just for Glade callbacks.\nAvoid adding code to geany.h if it will fit better elsewhere.\nSee the top of each ``src/*.c`` file for a brief description of what\nit's for.\n\nPlugin API code\n---------------\nPlease be aware that anything with a doc-comment (a comment with an\nextra asterisk: ``/**``) is something in the plugin API. Things like\nenums and structs can usually still be appended to, ensuring that all\nthe existing elements stay in place - this will keep the ABI stable.\n\n.. warning::\n\n    Some structs like GeanyCallback cannot be appended to without\n    breaking the ABI because they are used to declare structs by\n    plugins, not just for accessing struct members through a pointer.\n    Normally structs should never be allocated by plugins.\n\nKeeping the plugin ABI stable\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nIn general the ABI changes as little as we can manage. The ABI number\nmust match exactly between Geany and plugins, so an ABI change breaks\nall plugins until they are re-compiled. But sometimes it is absolutely\nnecessary. Removing a feature or significantly changing the semantics\nof an existing feature require an ABI change since existing plugins may\nno longer work with the modified version of Geany.\n\nThe API identifying number is increased whenever anything is added to\nthe API so plugins can test if the feature is available. The API number\nrequired by a plugin needs only to be lower than the API Geany provides,\nso an increase in API number without a change in ABI will not stop\nplugins that need a lower number from working.\n\nIf you're reordering or changing existing elements of structs that are\nused as part of the plugin API, you must increment GEANY_ABI_VERSION\nin plugindata.h. This is usually not needed if you're just appending\nfields to structs. The GEANY_API_VERSION value should be incremented\nfor any changes to the plugin API, including appending elements.\n\nIf you're in any doubt when making changes to plugin API code, just ask us.\n\nPlugin API/ABI design\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nYou should not make plugins rely on the size of a struct. This means:\n\n* Don't let plugins allocate any structs (stack or heap).\n* Don't let plugins index any arrays of structs.\n* Don't add any array fields to structs in case we want to change the\n  array size later.\n\nDoc-comments\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n* The @file tag can go in the source .c file, but use the .h header name so\n  it appears normally in the generated documentation. See ui_utils.c for an\n  example.\n* Function doc-comments should always go in the source file, not the\n  header, so they can be updated if/when the implementation changes.\n\nGlade\n-----\nAdd user-interface widgets to the Glade 3 file ``data/geany.glade``.\nCallbacks for the user-interface should go in ``src/callbacks.c``.\n\nUse Glade 3.8.5. The 3.8 series still supports GTK+ 2, and earlier\npoint releases did not preserve the order of XML elements, leading to\nunmanageable diffs.\n\nGTK versions & API documentation\n--------------------------------\nGeany requires GTK >= 3.0 and GLib >= 2.32. API symbols from newer GTK/GLib\nversions should be avoided or made optional to keep the source code building\non older systems.\n\nIt is recommended to use the 3.0 API documentation of the GTK\nlibs (including GLib, GDK and Pango) has the advantages\nthat you don't get confused by any newer API additions and you\ndon't have to take care about whether you can use them or not.\n\nYou might want to pass the ``-DGLIB_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=GLIB_VERSION_2_32`` C\npreprocessor flag to get warnings about newer symbols from the GLib.\n\nOn the contrary, you might also want to get deprecation warnings for symbols\ndeprecated in newer versions, typically when preparing a dependency bump or\ntrying to improve forward compatibility.\nTo do so, use the ``-UGLIB_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED`` flag for GLib deprecations,\nand ``-UGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS`` for GTK and GDK ones.\nTo change the lower deprecation bound for GLib (and then get warnings about\nsymbols deprecated more recently) instead of simply removing it entirely, use\n``-UGLIB_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED -DGLIB_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED=GLIB_VERSION_X_YY``.\n\nSee `Compiler options & warnings`_ for how to set such flags.\n\nCoding\n------\n* Don't write long functions with a lot of variables and/or scopes - break\n  them down into smaller static functions where possible. This makes code\n  much easier to read and maintain.\n* Use GLib types and functions - gint not int, g_free() not free().\n* Your code should build against GLib 2.32 and GTK 3.24.\n* Variables should be declared (and initialized) as close as practical\n  to their first use. This reduces the chances of intervening code being\n  inserted between declaration and use, where the variable may be\n  uninitialized.\n* Variables should be defined within the smallest scope that is practical,\n  for example inside a conditional branch which uses them or in the\n  initialization part of a for loop.\n* Local variables that will not be modified should be marked as ``const``\n  to indicate intention. This allows the compiler to give a warning if\n  part of the code accidentally tries to change the value.\n* Pointer parameters should be marked ``const`` if the value they point\n  to will not be mutated within the function.\n* Don't let variable names shadow outer variables - use gcc's -Wshadow\n  option.\n* Use the strictest possible data type where practical.\n  Avoid using untyped pointers (e.g. gpointer) where practical.\n  For an enumeration, use the actual enum type rather than just a\n  ``gint``, use a ``gchar`` for individual (ASCII/UTF-8) string\n  characters rather than ``gint``, and use a ``guint`` for integers\n  which cannot be negative rather than ``gint``.\n* Prefer loops to calling ``some_type_foreach()`` with a ``user_data``\n  argument. (Note: Some containers don't support external iteration,\n  e.g. for tree structures, so ``*_foreach`` is fine for those).\n* Do not use G_LIKELY or G_UNLIKELY (except in critical loops). These\n  add noise to the code with little real benefit.\n\nCompiler options & warnings\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nUse ``CFLAGS='-Wfoo' ./configure`` or ``CFLAGS='-Wfoo' ./autogen.sh``\nto set warning options (as well as anything else e.g. -g -O2).\n\n* Enable warnings - for gcc use '-Wall -Wextra' (and optionally\n  -Wno-unused-parameter to avoid unused parameter warnings in Glade\n  callbacks). Alternatively you can use the Glib macro G_GNUC_UNUSED\n  to suppress warnings on single parameters, e.g.\n  ``void examplefunction(G_GNUC_UNUSED gchar *foo)``. Also see\n  https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Miscellaneous-Macros.html.\n* You should try to write ISO C99 code for portability, so always\n  use C ``/* */`` comments and function_name(void) instead of\n  function_name(). This is for compatibility with various Unix-like\n  compilers. You should use -std=c99 to help check this.\n\n.. tip::\n    Remember for gcc you need to enable optimization to get certain\n    warnings like uninitialized variables, but for debugging it's\n    better to have no optimization on.\n\nStyle\n^^^^^\n* We use a tab width of 4 and indent completely with tabs not spaces.\n  Note the documentation files use (4) spaces instead, so you may want\n  to use the 'Detect from file' indent pref.\n* Do not add whitespace at the end of lines, this adds to commit noise.\n  When editing with Geany set preference files->Strip trailing spaces\n  and tabs.\n* Use the multiline comment ``/* */`` to comment small blocks of code,\n  functions descriptions or longer explanations of code, etc. The more\n  comments are in your code the better. (See also\n  ``scripts/fix-cxx-comments.pl`` in Git).\n* Lines should not be longer than about 100 characters and after 100\n  characters the lines should be wrapped and indented once more to\n  show that the line is continued.\n* We don't put spaces between function names and the opening brace for\n  argument lists.\n* Variable declarations come first after an opening brace, then one\n  newline to separate declarations and code.\n* 2-operand operators should have a space each side.\n* Function bodies should have 2 blank newlines after them.\n* Align braces together on separate lines.\n* Don't put assignments in 'if/while/etc' expressions except for loops,\n  for example ``for (int i = 0; i < some_limit; i++)``.\n* if statements without brace bodies should have the code on a separate\n  line, then a blank line afterwards.\n* Use braces after if/while statements if the body uses another\n  if/while statement.\n* Try to fit in with the existing code style.\n\n.. note::\n    A few of the above can be done with the Git\n    ``scripts/fix-alignment.pl``, but it is quite dumb and it's much better\n    to write it correctly in the first place.\n    ``scripts/rstrip-whitespace.py`` just removes trailing whitespace.\n\n\n.. below tabs should be used, but spaces are required for reST.\n\nExample::\n\n    struct Bar;\n\n    typedef struct Foo  /* struct names normally are the same as typedef names */\n    {\n        gint    foo;    /* names are somewhat aligned visually */\n        gint    bar;    /* fields don't share the same line */\n        SomeLongTypeName baz; /* alignment is not strict */\n        gchar   *ptr;   /* pointer symbol must go next to variable name, not type */\n        Bar     public; /**< only plugin API fields have a doc-comment */\n    }\n    Foo;\n\n\n    gint some_func(void);\n\n    gint some_other_func(void);\n\n\n    /* optional function comment explains something important */\n    gint function_long_name(gchar arg1, <too many args to fit on this line>,\n            gchar argN)\n    {\n        /* variable declarations always go before code in each scope */\n        /* variable names should NOT be aligned at all */\n        gint foo, bar;  /* variables can go on the same line */\n        gint baz;       /* but often don't */\n        gchar *ptr;     /* pointer symbol must go next to variable name, not type */\n        gchar *another; /* pointers should normally go on separate lines */\n\n        /* Some long comment block\n         * taking several different\n         * lines to explain */\n        if (foo)\n        {\n            /* variables only used in one scope should normally be declared there */\n            gint dir = -1;\n\n            bar = foo;\n            if ((bar & (guint)dir) != 7)\n                some_code(arg1, <too many args to fit on this line>,\n                    argN - 1, argN);\n\n            some_func();\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    /** Explains using doc-comments for plugin API functions.\n     * First line should be short and use the third person tense - 'explains',\n     * not 'explain'.\n     *\n     * @return Some number.\n     * @since 1.22. */\n    gint another_function(void)\n    {\n        ...\n\nHeader Includes\n---------------\n\nIn order to make including various headers in Geany more convenient, each\nfile should include what it uses. If there is a file named ``foo.c``, and a\nfile named ``foo.h``, it should be possible to include ``foo.h`` on its own\nwithout depending on stuff in ``foo.c`` that is included for the first time\nbefore ``foo.h``.\n\nPrivate Headers\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIf there is some data that needs to be shared between various parts of the\ncore code, put them in a \"private header\", that is, if the public header is\ncalled ``foo.h``, then make a ``fooprivate.h`` header that contains the\nnon-public functions, types, globals, etc that are needed. Other core source\nfiles can then just include the ``foo.h`` and/or ``fooprivate.h`` depending\nwhat they need, without exposing that stuff to plugins.\n\nOrder of Includes\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nInside a source file the includes section should be ordered like this:\n\n1. Always include the ``config.h`` file at the start of every source file,\n   for example::\n\n    #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H\n    # include \"config.h\"\n    #endif\n\n   This allows the Autotools and other build systems use the ``./configure``\n   time settings. If you don't do this, there's likely to be a number of\n   macros that you'll have to define in the build system or custom headers.\n\n   Warning: Never include ``config.h`` in headers, and especially in \"public\"\n   headers that plugins might include.\n\n2. Then include the header that has the same name as the source file (if\n   applicable). For example, for a source file named ``foo.c``, include\n   the ``foo.h`` below the ``config.h`` include. If there is a\n   ``fooprivate.h``, ``foo.c`` will most likely want to include that too,\n   put it in with includes in #3.\n\n3. At this point, it should be safe to include all the headers that declare\n   whatever is needed. If everything generally \"includes what it uses\" and\n   all files included contain the appropriate multiple-declaration guards\n   then the order of includes is fairly arbitrary. Prefer to use English\n   alphabetic order if possible.\n\n4. By now it doesn't really matter about the order, nothing below here is\n   \"our problem\". Semi-arbitrarily, you should use an include order like this:\n\n    1. Standard C headers\n    2. Non-standard system headers (eg. ``windows.h`` or ``unistd.h``)\n    3. GLib/GTK+ or related headers\n\n5. Everything else that should not influence 1-4.\n\nIncluding in Header Files\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nHeaders should also include what they use. All of the types should defined in\norder to allow the header to be included stand-alone. For example, if a\nheader uses a ``GtkWidget*``, it should ``#include <gtk/gtk.h>``. Or, if a\nheaders uses a ``GPtrArray*``, it should ``#include <glib.h>`` to ensure that\nall of the types are declared, whether by pointers/opaquely or fully, as\nrequired. Since all headers will use a ``G_BEGIN_DECLS`` and ``G_END_DECLS``\nguard for C++, the bare minimum for a header is to include ``glib.h`` or\n``<gtk/gtk.h>`` or ``gtkcompat.h`` or some other header that makes those\nmacros available.\n\n\nCommitting\n----------\n\n* Commit one thing at a time, do small commits.  Commits should be\n  meaningful and not too big when possible; multiple small commits are\n  good if there is no good reason to group them.\n* Use meaningful name and email in the Author and Committer fields.\n  This helps knowing who did what and allows to contact the author if\n  there is a good reason to do so (unlikely, but can happen).\n* When working on a new feature, create a new branch for it.  When\n  merging it, use the --no-ff option to make sure a merge commit will\n  be created to better track what happened.  However, if the feature\n  only took one commit you might merge it fast-forward since there is\n  not history to keep together.\n\nCommit messages\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nFollow the standard Git formatting:\n\n* No line should use more than about 80 characters (around 72 is best).\n* The first line is the commit's summary and is followed by an empty\n  line.  This summary should be one line and one line only, thus less\n  than 80 characters.  This summary should not include any punctuation\n  unless really needed.  See it as the subject of an email: keep it\n  concise and as precise as you can, but not tool long.\n* Following lines are optional detailed commit information, with\n  paragraphs separated by blank lines.  This part should be as long as\n  needed to describe the commit in depth, should use proper\n  punctuation and should include any useful information, like the\n  motivation for the patch and/or any valuable details the diff itself\n  don't provide or don't make clear.  Make it as complete as you think\n  it makes sense, but don't include an information that is better\n  explained by the commit's diff.\n\n  It is OK to use ASCII formatting like bullet list using \"*\" or \"-\",\n  etc. if useful, but emphasis (bold, italic, underline) should be\n  avoided.\n\nExample::\n\n    Ask the user if spawn fails in utils_open_browser()\n\n    Ask the user to configure a valid browser command if spawning it\n    fails rather than falling back to some arbitrary hardcoded defaults.\n\n    This avoid spawning an unexpected browser when the configured one is\n    wrong, and gives the user a chance to correctly fix the preference.\n\n\nTesting\n-------\n* Run with ``-v`` to print any debug messages.\n* You can use a second instance (``geany -i``).\n* To check first-run behaviour, use an alternate config directory by\n  passing ``-c some_dir`` (but make sure the directory is clean first).\n* For debugging tips, see `GDB`_.\n\nBugs to watch out for\n---------------------\n* Forgetting to check *doc->is_valid* when looping through\n  *documents_array* - instead use *foreach_document()*.\n* Inserting fields into structs in the plugin API instead of appending.\n* Not breaking the plugin ABI when necessary.\n* Using an idle callback that doesn't check main_status.quitting.\n* Forgetting CRLF line endings on Windows.\n* Not handling Tabs & Spaces indent mode.\n\nLibraries\n---------\nWe try to use an unmodified version of Scintilla - any new lexers or\nother changes should be passed on to the maintainers at\nhttps://scintilla.org. We normally update to a new Scintilla release\nshortly after one is made. See also scintilla/README.\n\nWe use an unmodified subset of universal-ctags sources\n(https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) to parse open documents. We\nalso use the great majority of unmodified universal-ctags parsers except\na few outliers that are maintained by us (those whose file names start\nwith `geany_`). We normally update to the latest version of\nuniversal-ctags shortly after making a Geany release and keep this\nversion during the rest of the development cycle.\n\nNotes\n=====\nSome of these notes below are brief (or maybe incomplete) - please\ncontact the geany-devel mailing list for more information.\n\nUsing pre-defined autotools values\n----------------------------------\nWhen you are use macros supplied by the autotools like GEANY_PREFIX,\nGEANY_LIBDIR, GEANY_DATADIR and GEANY_LOCALEDIR be aware that these\nmight not be static strings when Geany is configured with\n--enable-binreloc. Then these macros will be replaced by function calls\n(in src/prefix.h). So, don't use anything like\nprintf(\"Prefix: \" GEANY_PREFIX); but instead use\nprintf(\"Prefix: %s\", GEANY_PREFIX);\n\nAdding a source file foo.[hc] in src/ or plugins/\n-------------------------------------------------\n* Add foo.c, foo.h to SRCS in path/Makefile.am and meson.build.\n* Add path/foo.c to po/POTFILES.in (for string translation).\n\nAdding a filetype\n-----------------\nYou can add a filetype without syntax highlighting or tag parsing, but\ncheck to see if those features have been written in upstream projects\nfirst (scintilla or ctags).\n\n**Custom:**\n\nIf you want to reuse an existing lexer and/or tag parser, making a\ncustom filetype is probably easier - it doesn't require any\nchanges to the source code. Follow instructions in the manual:\nhttps://geany.org/manual/index.html#custom-filetypes.\n\n.. warning::\n  You should use the newer `[build-menu]` section for default build\n  commands - the older `[build_settings]` may not work correctly for\n  custom filetypes.\n\n**Built-in:**\n\n* Add GEANY_FILETYPES_FOO to filetypes.h.\n* Initialize GEANY_FILETYPES_FOO in init_builtin_filetypes() of\n  filetypes.c.\n* Update data/filetype_extensions.conf.\n\nThe remaining notes relate mostly to built-in filetypes.\n\nfiletypes.* configuration file\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAll languages need a data/filedefs/filetypes.foo configuration file. See\nthe \"Filetype definition files\" section in the manual and/or\ndata/filedefs/filetypes.c for an example.\n\nProgramming languages should have:\n\n* [keywords] if the lexer supports it.\n* [settings] mostly for comment settings.\n* [build-menu] (or [build_settings]) for commands to run.\n\nFor languages with a Scintilla lexer, there should be a [styling] section,\nto correspond to the styles used in highlighting_styles_FOO[] in\nhighlightingmappings.h - see below.\n\nDon't forget to add the newly created filetype file to data/Makefile.am.\n\nSyntax highlighting\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nIt may be possible to use an existing Scintilla lexer in the scintilla/\nsubdirectory - if not, you will need to find (or write) one,\nLexFoo.cxx. Try the official Scintilla project first.\n\n.. warning::\n    We won't accept adding a lexer that conflicts with one in\n    Scintilla. All new lexers should be submitted back to the Scintilla\n    project to save duplication of work.\n\nWhen adding a lexer:\n\n* add LexFoo.cxx to scintilla/lexilla/lexers\n* add ``&lmFoo`` to scintilla/lexilla/src/Lexilla.cxx\n* update scintilla/scintilla_changes.patch to contain ``+ &lmFoo,`` and\n  increment ``s`` in the hunk header ``@@ -R,r +S,s @@`` above the added line\n* update scintilla/Makefile.am and meson.build\n\nFor syntax highlighting, you will need to edit highlighting.c and\nhighlightingmappings.h and add the following things:\n\n1. In highlightingmappings.h:\n\n   a. define ``highlighting_lexer_FOO`` to the Scintilla lexer ID for\n      this filtype, e.g. ``SCLEX_CPP``.\n   b. define the ``highlighting_styles_FOO`` array that maps Scintilla\n      style states to style names in the configuration file.\n   c. define ``highlighting_keywords_FOO`` to ``EMPTY_KEYWORDS`` if the\n      filtype has no keywords, or as an ``HLKeyword`` array mapping\n      the Scintilla keyword IDs to names in the configuration file.\n   d. define ``highlighting_properties_FOO`` to ``EMPTY_PROPERTIES``, or\n      as an array of ``HLProperty`` if the filetype requires some lexer\n      properties to be set.  However, note that properties should\n      normally be set in the ``[lexer_properties]`` section of the\n      configuration file instead.\n\n   You may look at other filtype's definitions for some examples\n   (Ada, CSS or Diff being good examples).\n\n2. In highlighting.c:\n\n   a. Add ``init_styleset_case(FOO);`` in ``highlighting_init_styles()``.\n   b. Add ``styleset_case(FOO);`` in ``highlighting_set_styles()``.\n\n3. Write data/filedefs/filetypes.foo configuration file [styling] section. See\n   the manual and see data/filedefs/filetypes.d for a named style example.\n\n.. note::\n    Please try to make your styles fit in with the other filetypes'\n    default colors, and to use named styles where possible (e.g.\n    \"commentline=comment\"). Filetypes that share a lexer should have\n    the same colors. If not using named styles, leave the background color\n    empty to match the default color.\n\nError message parsing\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nNew-style error message parsing is done with an extended GNU-style regex\nstored in the filetypes.foo file - see the [build_settings] information\nin the manual for details.\n\nOld-style error message parsing is done in\nmsgwin_parse_compiler_error_line() of msgwindow.c - see the ParseData\ntypedef for more information.\n\nOther features\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nIf the lexer has comment styles, you should add them in\nhighlighting_is_comment_style(). You should also update\nhighlighting_is_string_style() for string/character styles. For now,\nthis prevents calltips and autocompletion when typing in a comment\n(but it can still be forced by the user).\n\nFor brace indentation, update lexer_has_braces() in editor.c;\nindentation after ':' is done from on_new_line_added().\n\nIf the Scintilla lexer supports user type keyword highlighting (e.g.\nSCLEX_CPP), update document_highlight_tags() in document.c.\n\nIf the filetype is a scripting language and the interpreter can be started\nusing a shebang, update find_shebang() in filetypes.c.\n\nUpdate editor_set_indentation_guides() in editor.c if needed.\n\nAdding a CTags parser\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThis assumes the filetype for Geany already exists.\n\nFirst write or find a CTags compatible parser, foo.c. Check this fork:\nhttps://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags\n\nMethod\n``````\n* Add ctags/parsers/foo.c to ``parsers`` in ctags/Makefile.am and to the\n  ``ctags`` library in meson.build.\n* Add Foo to src/tagmanager/tm_parsers.h\n* Add TM_PARSER_FOO to src/tagmanager/tm_parser.h.  The list here must follow\n  exactly the order in src/tagmanager/tm_parsers.h.\n\nIn src/tagmanager/tm_parser.c:\nAdd a map_FOO TMParserMapEntry mapping each kind's letter from foo.c's\nFooKinds to the appropriate TMTagType, and add the corresponding\nMAP_ENTRY(FOO) to parser_map.\n\nIn src/tagmanager/tm_parser.c:\nAdd a group_FOO TMParserMapGroup defining root nodes of the symbol tree,\nused icons and TMTagType values grouped under the specified root.\nMultiple TMTagType values can be combined under a single root using |\n(bitwise OR).\n\nIn src/tagmanager/tm_parser.c:\nUpdate various functions at the end of tm_parser.c to adjust Geany\nbehavior to the behavior of the added parser. In particular, update\ntm_parser_scope_separator() and tm_parser_has_full_scope() so\nscope-related functionality works correctly.\n\nIn filetypes.c, init_builtin_filetypes():\nSet the 2nd argument of the FT_INIT() macro for this filetype to FOO.\n\nTests\n`````\nThe tag parser tests checks if the proper tags are emitted\nfor a given source. Tests for tag parsers consist of two files: the\nsource to parse, and the expected output. Tests are run using ``make\ncheck``.\n\nThe source to parse should be in the file ``tests/ctags/mytest.ext``,\nwhere ``mytest`` is the name you choose for your test, and ``ext`` is an\nextension recognized by Geany as the language the test file is for.\nThis file should contain a snippet of the language to test for.\nIt can be either long or short, depending on what it tests.\n\nThe expected output should be in the file ``tests/ctags/mytest.ext.tags``\n(which is the same name as the source, but with ``.tags`` appended), and\nshould be in the format generated by::\n\n    $ geany -g tmp.ext.tags tests/ctags/mytest.ext\n    $ scripts/print-tags.py < tmp.ext.tags > tests/ctags/mytest.ext.tags\n\nThis file contains the tag information expected to be generated from\nthe corresponding source file together with its human-readable form.\n\nWhen you have these two files, you have to list your new test along the\nother ones in the ``test_source`` variable in ``tests/ctags/Makefile.am``\nand ``tests/meson.build``. Please keep this list sorted alphabetically.\n\nUpgrading Scintilla and Lexilla\n-------------------------------\n\nTo upgrade the local Scintilla and Lexilla copy, use the\n``scripts/update-scintilla.sh`` script.\n\nTo use it, you need to first obtain a copy of the Scintilla and Lexilla sources\nyou want to update to.  This will generally mean checking out a release tag\nfrom the Scintilla Mercurial repository and the Lexilla git repository, or\nextracting a tarball.\n\nThen, just run the script from Geany's ``scripts`` directory, passing the path\nto the Scintilla source directory as the first argument and the Lexilla\nsource directory as the second argument, and follow the\ninstructions, if any::\n\n    ./scripts/update-scintilla.sh /path/to/scintilla/ /path/to/lexilla/\n\nGDB\n---\n\nStop on warnings\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWhen a GLib or GTK warning is printed, often you want to get a\nbacktrace to find out what code caused them. You can do that with the\n``--g-fatal-warnings`` argument, which will abort Geany on the first\nwarning it receives.\n\nBut for ordinary testing, you don't always want your editor to abort\njust because of a warning - use::\n\n    (gdb) b handler_log if level <= G_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING\n\n\nRunning with batch commands\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nUse::\n\n    $ gdb src/geany -x gdb-commands\n\nWhere ``gdb-commands`` is a file with the following lines::\n\n    set pagination off\n    b handler_log if level <= G_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING\n    r -v\n\n\nLoading a plugin\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThis is useful so you can load plugins without installing them first.\nAlternatively you can use a symlink in ~/.config/geany/plugins or\n$prefix/lib/geany (where $prefix is /usr/local by default).\n\nThe gdb session below was run from the toplevel Geany source directory.\nStart normally with e.g. \"gdb src/geany\".\nType 'r' to run.\nPress Ctrl-C from the gdb window to interrupt program execution.\n\nExample::\n\n    Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.\n    0x00d16402 in __kernel_vsyscall ()\n    (gdb) call plugin_new(\"./plugins/.libs/demoplugin.so\")\n    ** INFO: Loaded:   ./plugins/.libs/demoplugin.so (Demo)\n    $1 = (Plugin *) 0x905a890\n    (gdb) c\n    Continuing.\n\n    Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.\n    0x00d16402 in __kernel_vsyscall ()\n    (gdb) call plugin_free(0x905a890)\n    ** INFO: Unloaded: ./plugins/.libs/demoplugin.so\n    (gdb) c\n    Continuing.\n\nBuilding Plugins\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe geany-plugins autotools script automatically detects the\ninstalled system Geany and builds the plugins against that.\n\nTo use plugins with a development version of Geany built with\na different prefix, the plugins will need to be compiled against\nthat version if the ABI has changed.\n\nTo do this you need to specify both --prefix and --with-geany-libdir\nto the plugin configure.  Normally the plugin prefix is the\nsame as the Geany prefix to keep plugins with the version of Geany\nthat they are compiled against, and with-geany-libdir is the Geany\nprefix/lib.\n\nWhilst it is possible for the plugin prefix to be different to\nthe prefix of the libdir (which is why there are two settings),\nit is probably better to keep the version of Geany and its plugins\ntogether.\n"

          "content": "Installation Instructions\n*************************\n\n   Copyright (C) 1994-1996, 1999-2002, 2004-2017, 2020-2021 Free\nSoftware Foundation, Inc.\n\n   Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,\nare permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright\nnotice and this notice are preserved.  This file is offered as-is,\nwithout warranty of any kind.\n\nBasic Installation\n==================\n\n   Briefly, the shell command './configure && make && make install'\nshould configure, build, and install this package.  The following\nmore-detailed instructions are generic; see the 'README' file for\ninstructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this\n'INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented\nbelow.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not\nnecessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found\nin *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.\n\n   The 'configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for\nvarious system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses\nthose values to create a 'Makefile' in each directory of the package.\nIt may also create one or more '.h' files containing system-dependent\ndefinitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script 'config.status' that\nyou can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a\nfile 'config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for\ndebugging 'configure').\n\n   It can also use an optional file (typically called 'config.cache' and\nenabled with '--cache-file=config.cache' or simply '-C') that saves the\nresults of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is disabled by\ndefault to prevent problems with accidental use of stale cache files.\n\n   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try\nto figure out how 'configure' could check whether to do them, and mail\ndiffs or instructions to the address given in the 'README' so they can\nbe considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at\nsome point 'config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you\nmay remove or edit it.\n\n   The file 'configure.ac' (or 'configure.in') is used to create\n'configure' by a program called 'autoconf'.  You need 'configure.ac' if\nyou want to change it or regenerate 'configure' using a newer version of\n'autoconf'.\n\n   The simplest way to compile this package is:\n\n  1. 'cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type\n     './configure' to configure the package for your system.\n\n     Running 'configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints\n     some messages telling which features it is checking for.\n\n  2. Type 'make' to compile the package.\n\n  3. Optionally, type 'make check' to run any self-tests that come with\n     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.\n\n  4. Type 'make install' to install the programs and any data files and\n     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is\n     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular\n     user, and only the 'make install' phase executed with root\n     privileges.\n\n  5. Optionally, type 'make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but\n     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.\n     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a\n     regular user, particularly if the prior 'make install' required\n     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed\n     correctly.\n\n  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the\n     source code directory by typing 'make clean'.  To also remove the\n     files that 'configure' created (so you can compile the package for\n     a different kind of computer), type 'make distclean'.  There is\n     also a 'make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly\n     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get\n     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came\n     with the distribution.\n\n  7. Often, you can also type 'make uninstall' to remove the installed\n     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that\n     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the\n     GNU Coding Standards.\n\n  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide 'make\n     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other\n     targets like 'make install' and 'make uninstall' work correctly.\n     This target is generally not run by end users.\n\nCompilers and Options\n=====================\n\n   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that\nthe 'configure' script does not know about.  Run './configure --help'\nfor details on some of the pertinent environment variables.\n\n   You can give 'configure' initial values for configuration parameters\nby setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here is\nan example:\n\n     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix\n\n   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.\n\nCompiling For Multiple Architectures\n====================================\n\n   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the\nsame time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their\nown directory.  To do this, you can use GNU 'make'.  'cd' to the\ndirectory where you want the object files and executables to go and run\nthe 'configure' script.  'configure' automatically checks for the source\ncode in the directory that 'configure' is in and in '..'.  This is known\nas a \"VPATH\" build.\n\n   With a non-GNU 'make', it is safer to compile the package for one\narchitecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have\ninstalled the package for one architecture, use 'make distclean' before\nreconfiguring for another architecture.\n\n   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and\nexecutables that work on multiple system types--known as \"fat\" or\n\"universal\" binaries--by specifying multiple '-arch' options to the\ncompiler but only a single '-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like\nthis:\n\n     ./configure CC=\"gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64\" \\\n                 CXX=\"g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64\" \\\n                 CPP=\"gcc -E\" CXXCPP=\"g++ -E\"\n\n   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you\nmay have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results\nusing the 'lipo' tool if you have problems.\n\nInstallation Names\n==================\n\n   By default, 'make install' installs the package's commands under\n'/usr/local/bin', include files under '/usr/local/include', etc.  You\ncan specify an installation prefix other than '/usr/local' by giving\n'configure' the option '--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an\nabsolute file name.\n\n   You can specify separate installation prefixes for\narchitecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you\npass the option '--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to 'configure', the package uses\nPREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.\nDocumentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.\n\n   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give\noptions like '--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular\nkinds of files.  Run 'configure --help' for a list of the directories\nyou can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the default\nfor these options is expressed in terms of '${prefix}', so that\nspecifying just '--prefix' will affect all of the other directory\nspecifications that were not explicitly provided.\n\n   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the\ncorrect locations to 'configure'; however, many packages provide one or\nboth of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the\n'make install' command line to change installation locations without\nhaving to reconfigure or recompile.\n\n   The first method involves providing an override variable for each\naffected directory.  For example, 'make install\nprefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all\ndirectory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of\n'${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during 'configure',\nbut not in terms of '${prefix}', must each be overridden at install time\nfor the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of makefile\nvariable overrides for each directory variable is required by the GNU\nCoding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.  However, some\nplatforms have known limitations with the semantics of shared libraries\nthat end up requiring recompilation when using this method, particularly\nnoticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.\n\n   The second method involves providing the 'DESTDIR' variable.  For\nexample, 'make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend\n'/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of\n'DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and\ndoes not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,\nit does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even\nwhen some directory options were not specified in terms of '${prefix}'\nat 'configure' time.\n\nOptional Features\n=================\n\n   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed\nwith an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving 'configure' the\noption '--program-prefix=PREFIX' or '--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.\n\n   Some packages pay attention to '--enable-FEATURE' options to\n'configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.\nThey may also pay attention to '--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE\nis something like 'gnu-as' or 'x' (for the X Window System).  The\n'README' should mention any '--enable-' and '--with-' options that the\npackage recognizes.\n\n   For packages that use the X Window System, 'configure' can usually\nfind the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,\nyou can use the 'configure' options '--x-includes=DIR' and\n'--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.\n\n   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the\nexecution of 'make' will be.  For these packages, running './configure\n--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be\noverridden with 'make V=1'; while running './configure\n--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be\noverridden with 'make V=0'.\n\nParticular systems\n==================\n\n   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU CC\nis not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in\norder to use an ANSI C compiler:\n\n     ./configure CC=\"cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500\"\n\nand if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.\n\n   HP-UX 'make' updates targets which have the same timestamps as their\nprerequisites, which makes it generally unusable when shipped generated\nfiles such as 'configure' are involved.  Use GNU 'make' instead.\n\n   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot\nparse its '<wchar.h>' header file.  The option '-nodtk' can be used as a\nworkaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended to\ntry\n\n     ./configure CC=\"cc\"\n\nand if that doesn't work, try\n\n     ./configure CC=\"cc -nodtk\"\n\n   On Solaris, don't put '/usr/ucb' early in your 'PATH'.  This\ndirectory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of\nthese programs are available in '/usr/bin'.  So, if you need '/usr/ucb'\nin your 'PATH', put it _after_ '/usr/bin'.\n\n   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in '/boot/common',\nnot '/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:\n\n     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common\n\nSpecifying the System Type\n==========================\n\n   There may be some features 'configure' cannot figure out\nautomatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package\nwill run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the\n_same_ architectures, 'configure' can figure that out, but if it prints\na message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the\n'--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system\ntype, such as 'sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:\n\n     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM\n\nwhere SYSTEM can have one of these forms:\n\n     OS\n     KERNEL-OS\n\n   See the file 'config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If\n'config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't\nneed to know the machine type.\n\n   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should\nuse the option '--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will\nproduce code for.\n\n   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a\nplatform different from the build platform, you should specify the\n\"host\" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will\neventually be run) with '--host=TYPE'.\n\nSharing Defaults\n================\n\n   If you want to set default values for 'configure' scripts to share,\nyou can create a site shell script called 'config.site' that gives\ndefault values for variables like 'CC', 'cache_file', and 'prefix'.\n'configure' looks for 'PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then\n'PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the\n'CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.\nA warning: not all 'configure' scripts look for a site script.\n\nDefining Variables\n==================\n\n   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the\nenvironment passed to 'configure'.  However, some packages may run\nconfigure again during the build, and the customized values of these\nvariables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set\nthem in the 'configure' command line, using 'VAR=value'.  For example:\n\n     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc\n\ncauses the specified 'gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is\noverridden in the site shell script).\n\nUnfortunately, this technique does not work for 'CONFIG_SHELL' due to an\nAutoconf limitation.  Until the limitation is lifted, you can use this\nworkaround:\n\n     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash\n\n'configure' Invocation\n======================\n\n   'configure' recognizes the following options to control how it\noperates.\n\n'--help'\n'-h'\n     Print a summary of all of the options to 'configure', and exit.\n\n'--help=short'\n'--help=recursive'\n     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's\n     'configure', and exit.  The 'short' variant lists options used only\n     in the top level, while the 'recursive' variant lists options also\n     present in any nested packages.\n\n'--version'\n'-V'\n     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the 'configure'\n     script, and exit.\n\n'--cache-file=FILE'\n     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,\n     traditionally 'config.cache'.  FILE defaults to '/dev/null' to\n     disable caching.\n\n'--config-cache'\n'-C'\n     Alias for '--cache-file=config.cache'.\n\n'--quiet'\n'--silent'\n'-q'\n     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To\n     suppress all normal output, redirect it to '/dev/null' (any error\n     messages will still be shown).\n\n'--srcdir=DIR'\n     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually\n     'configure' can determine that directory automatically.\n\n'--prefix=DIR'\n     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names:: for\n     more details, including other options available for fine-tuning the\n     installation locations.\n\n'--no-create'\n'-n'\n     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output\n     files.\n\n'configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run\n'configure --help' for more details.\n"

          "content": "Geany - A fast and lightweight IDE\n----------------------------------\n\n\nAbout\n-----\nGeany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.\nIt was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a\nfew dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent\nas possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME. So it\nis using only the GTK+ toolkit and therefore you need only the\nGTK+ runtime libraries to run Geany.\n\n.. image:: doc/images/main_window.png\n  :width: 750\n  :alt: Screenshot of Geany showing the main user interface\n  :target: doc/images/main_window.png\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\nThe basic features of Geany are:\n\n- syntax highlighting\n- code completion\n- auto completion of often used constructs like if, for and while\n- auto completion of XML and HTML tags\n- call tips\n- folding\n- many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal\n- symbol lists\n- embedded terminal emulation\n- extensibility through plugins\n\n\nInstallation from distribution packages\n---------------------------------------\nUsing distribution packages on Linux, BSD and similar distributions\nis the easiest and recommended way. This way you will also benefit\nfrom automatic Geany updates by the package manager of the distribution.\n\nPackages are available for most distributions including Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu\nand many more.\n\n\nInstallation on Mac OS and Windows\n----------------------------------\nPrebuilt binary packages for Mac OS and Windows can be found on\nhttps://www.geany.org.\n\n\nInstallation from sources\n-------------------------\n\nRequirements\n++++++++++++\nFor compiling Geany yourself, you will need the GTK3 libraries and \nheader files. You will also need its dependency libraries and header \nfiles, such as Pango, Glib and ATK. All these files are available at \nhttps://www.gtk.org.\n\nFurthermore you need, of course, a C compiler and the Make tool; a C++\ncompiler is also needed for the required Scintilla library included. The\nGNU versions of these tools are recommended.\n\n\nTo build the user manual you need *rst2html* from Docutils. A pre-built\nversion of the manual is available in distribution tarballs and will be used as\nfallback if *rst2html* is missing. When building from Git however, that\npre-built version is not included and *rst2html* is required by default.\nYou can explicitly disable building the user manual using the\n``--disable-html-docs`` *configure* flag, but this will result in not\ninstalling a local version of the user manual, and Geany will then try\nand open the online version instead when requested.\n\n\n.. note::\n    Building Geany from source on Mac OS and Windows is more complicated\n    and is out of scope of this document. For more information on\n    building instructions for these platforms, please check the wiki\n    at https://wiki.geany.org/howtos/.\n\nInstalling from a Git clone\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nUsing the Meson build system\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nN.B. Meson support is still incomplete and a work-in-progress.\n\nMeson requires to chose a separate build directory. Either create\none, or let meson do it:\n\n``meson build`` or ``mkdir build; cd build; meson ..``\n\nEither command will configure the build system. The system is probed\nin many ways and system-dependant build files are created. This includes\nlocation of dependencies and compiler and linker flags required for them.\n\nTo build Geany, follow with a ``meson compile -C build``\n\nTo install Geany, follow the build with a ``sudo meson install -C build``.\n\nBy default, meson will install Geany to ``/usr/local``. A different\nprefix can be selected at the initial command or via reconfiguration:\n\n``meson --prefix /opt build`` or ``meson configure --prefix /opt build``\n\nGeany has some selectable features that may reduce the required\nbuild and runtime dependencies. See meson_optionts.txt for a full list.\n\nTo turn a feature off, use ``-D<feature>=false`` when configuring the build,\nfor example: ``meson configure -Dvte=false build``\n\nUsing Autotools\n+++++++++++++++\n\nInstall Autotools (*autopoint*, *automake*, *autoconf* and *libtool*),\n*gettext*, and the GLib development files **before** running any of the\nfollowing commands, as well as *rst2html* from Docutils (see above for\ndetails). Then, run ``./autogen.sh`` and then follow the instructions for\n`installing from a release tarball`_.\n\nInstalling from a release tarball\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nRun the the following three commands::\n\n    $ ./configure\n    $ make\n    (as root, or using sudo)\n    % make install\n\nFor more configuration details run ``./configure --help``.\n\nIf there are any errors during compilation, check your build environment\nand try to find the error, otherwise contact the mailing list or one of\nthe authors.\n\nSee the manual for details (geany.txt/geany.html).\n\n\nUsage\n-----\nTo run Geany just type::\n\n    $ geany\n\non a console or use the applications menu from your desktop environment.\nFor command line options, see the manual page of Geany or run::\n\n    $ geany --help\n\nfor details. Or look into the documentation in the *doc/* directory.\nThe most important option probably is ``-c`` or ``--config``, where you can\nspecify an alternate configuration directory.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nGeany is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the\nLicense, or (at your option) any later version.

          "content": "Quick Guide for new translations\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you would like to translate Geany into another language, have a look at the\nlanguage statistics page at [1] first to see if your desired language already\nexists. If it already exists, please read the \"Notes for updating translations\"\nsection. Otherwise, get the Git version of Geany, change to the po directory and\nstart the new translation with:\n\n$ msginit -l ll_CC -o ll.po -i geany.pot\n\nFill in ll with the language code and CC with the country code. For example, to\ntranslate Geany into Italian you would type:\n\n$ msginit -l it_IT -o it.po -i geany.pot\n\nThis will create a file it.po. This file can be opened with a text editor\n(e.g. Geany ;-)) or a graphical program like PoEdit [2]. There are also several\nother GUI programs for working on translations.\n\nYou don't need to modify the file po/LINGUAS, it is regenerated automatically on\nthe next build.\n\nWhen you have finished editing the file, check the file with:\n\n$ msgfmt -c --check-accelerators=_ it.po\n\nPlease ensure you also translate the mnemonic letters (strings containing a\n\"_\" before a letter, also called \"accelerators\" on some platforms/toolkits).\nWhen the user wishes to activate a menu item using their keyboard, they will\nuse this letter to pick an item from the menu.\n\nHere are a few notes on picking which letter to use:\n\n* Always follow platform/toolkit conventions (for example \"t\" for \"Cut\") even\nif they don't necessarily seem obvious.\n* Try to choose the first letter of the command name, where this is the most\nappropriate letter (for example \"S\" for \"Save\"), assuming it's not already\nused in the same menu.\n* Try not to use the same character more than once in the same menu as this\nwill cause the user to have to press the mnemonic's key multiple times to\nselect the correct menu item.\n* If there is no letter in the text that can easily be entered from a keyboard\nthen choose another character that can be, and put it in parenthesis after the\ntranslated text.\n* Try not to change which letter is used whenever possible as it is not\nuser-configurable and users may have become accustomed to using the existing\nmnemonic key.\n\nWhen you have finished your work - which doesn't mean you finished the\ntranslation, you will not have to work alone - send the file to the translation\nmailing list [3] or directly to Frank Lanitz [4] and he will add the translation\nto Geany then.\n\nIt is a good idea to let any translator and Frank know before you start or while\ntranslating, because they can give you hints on translating and Frank can ensure\nthat a translation is not already in progress.\n\n\nNotes for updating translations\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you want to update an existing translation, please contact the translation\nmailing list [3] and/or Frank Lanitz [4] directly. He is supervising all\ntranslation issues and will contact the maintainer of the translation you want\nto update to avoid any conflicts.\n\nSome translation statistics can be found at:\nhttps://i18n.geany.org/\n\n\nI18n mailing list\n-----------------\n\nThere is also a mailing list dedicated to translation issues. Please visit\nhttps://www.geany.org/Support/MailingList#geany-i18 for more information.\n\n\n[1] https://i18n.geany.org/\n[2] https://www.poedit.net/\n[3] https://www.geany.org/support/mailing-lists/#geany-i18n\n[4] Frank Lanitz <frank(at)frank(dot)uvena(dot)de>\n"

          "content": "Notes for package maintainers\n-----------------------------\n\n\nAbout this file\n---------------\nThe following notes are intended for package maintainers. These are not\nmeant as strict rules but only as hints and ideas to make a package\nmaintainer's life a little bit easier.\nSo it doesn't make much sense to include this file in any created\npackages for general distribution.\n\n\nPackaging hints\n---------------\nIf the final file size of the created packaged is a problem, you might\nignore some files and don't package them or put them into a separate\npackage. This can be easily done (without any further complications)\nwith the translations files(files in %prefix/share/locale/).\nAnother possibility is to skip the tags files in the data/ subdirectory.\nThese are only for auto completion of global symbols. If the files are\nmissing Geany just doesn't provide these global symbol auto completion\nbut all other things will work anyways.\nYou can also skip packaging the full HTML documentation including\nimages. But if you do so, please include at least the text form of the\nmanual.\nWhat you shouldn't skip in your package: the filetype.* files in the\ndata/ subdirectory, these files are important. If they are missing,\nGeany still has a fallback mechanism for syntax highlighting (if\nfiletypes.common is installed) but several other features for certain\nfiletypes will fail (mainly build support).\n\nFor 32 bit builds targeting systems which support large filesystems\n(eg XFS) it may be necessary to build with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.\n\n\nTesting your package\n--------------------\nThere are a few things to take care of when you create a package:\n- Please check whether you include the following files:\n  ScintillaLicense.txt, README, manual.txt, COPYING.\n  ScintillaLicense.txt is the name of the installed file in the doc/\n  directory. In the source distribution, this file can be found in\n  scintilla/License.txt.\n  The file COPYING is the GPLv2 license text and should(have to?) be\n  included in your package.\n- Start Geany after it was installed out of your package. Pass the\n  command line argument \"-v\" to see whether Geany complains about\n  missing files.\n- Check whether the help menu item (Help->Help or F1) works and opens\n  the local installed HTML documentation in your browser (if it opens\n  the manual on the website you didn't install the HTML manual correctly\n  and Geany falls back to the online manual).\n- Check the About dialog (Help->About) whether it displays the full\n  GPLv2 license text on the last tab(\"License\").\n\n\nFeedback\n--------\nIf you have to modify anything to package the Geany sources for your\ndistribution/target and these changes might be generally useful, please\nreport your changes to us(the Geany developers) so we can apply them.\nSuch changes could be removing/adding any files, modifying the autotools\nconfiguration, any modifications to some \"meta\" files (like\ngeany.desktop, images/icons, ...) or even if you have to\nmodify the source code to fix broken compilation or something like this.\nPlease inform us about changes you made, so maybe you don't have to\nchange it again with the next release and we can fix it in Geany itself\nso others could also benefit from these changes.\n\n\nAnnounce your packages\n---------------------\nAfter finishing your package creation, feel free to drop a note on\nGeany's mailing list or directly to us (the Geany developers) to\ninform us about it. If you wish, we can also add a link on Geany's\nwebsite to your package.\n\n\nGeany announcements\n-------------------\nPackage maintainers are encouraged to subscribe to the Geany mailing\nlist to stay informed about major changes and of course, new releases.\n"
