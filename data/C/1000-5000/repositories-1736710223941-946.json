(Patch by orbea)\n    * Fix tests when building with magic=1\n\nMon, 22 Aug 2022 17:49:11 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.9.1\n    * Set libcurl user agent to \"feh/3.9.1\". Previously, feh did not send a\n      user agent.\n\nSun, 12 Jun 2022 13:12:00 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.9\n    * Fix compilation on macOS by defining _DARWIN_C_SOURCE for\n      mkdtemp and mkstemps. (Patch by Ryan Schmidt)\n    * Remove magic byte check before passing an image to Imlib2.\n      This check was introduced in feh 3.6 to work around an issue with\n      Imlib2 being slow to determine image loadability in some cases\n      <https://phab.enlightenment.org/T8739>. By now, an Imlib2 version without\n      this issue should be available in all recent distributions, so the check\n      in feh is no longer required. For a slight speed-up, or to use feh with\n      an affected Imlib2 version (1.6.x or 1.7.0), compile feh with 'magic=1'.\n      In this case, feh will use libmagic to determine whether a file is an\n      image, and only pass images to Imlib2. (Patch by Christian Hesse)\n    * Fix crash (segmentation fault due to null pointer dereference) when\n      toggling fullscreen mode while moving the cursor.\n    * Note that feh no longer supplies its own getopt_long function.\n      getopt_long is provided by a wide range of libc implementations, so\n      there is no need for feh to duplicate it. (Patch by Guilherme Janczak)\n\nMon, 03 Jan 2022 11:29:03 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.8\n    * Add button ID \"0\" to cursor bindings. This pseudo-button is triggered\n      whenever feh observes a cursor movement. It does not have a default\n      binding.\n    * Support hexadecimal IDs in --window-id\n    * Disable --auto-rotate in feh builds compiled with Imlib2 1.7.5 or later.\n      Imlib2 1.7.5 introduces transparent EXIF-based image orientation\n      adjustment, so --auto-rotate is no longer needed (and would cause\n      mis-orientation of images, as Imlib2 has already adjusted the\n      orientation).\n\nSat, 25 Sep 2021 09:21:25 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.7.2\n    * Fix crash when running feh without stdin file descriptor\n\nSat, 24 Jul 2021 22:30:12 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.7.1\n    * Support JPEG XL files when using imlib2-jxl (patch by Alistair)\n    * Fix support for images smaller than 16 bytes (patch by David Buchanan)\n    * Fix some out of bounds reads (patches by Tobias Stoeckmann)\n\nSun, 09 May 2021 11:31:55 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.7\n    * Use compact representation instead of key-value pairs for common EXIF data\n      (only applies when compiling feh with exif=1)\n    * Add --window-id <windowid> option (draw to an existing window)\n    * Add --zoom-step <percent> option (specify zoom step size)\n    * Pass gopher:// and gophers:// URLs to libcurl\n    * Fix --reload / --auto-reload reloading the wrong directory when\n      using --start-at and no file arguments or filelists have been\n      specified\n    * Fix Ctrl+key causing unintended behaviour when controlling feh via stdin\n    * Fix high CPU usage when closing stdin after starting feh from a terminal\n\nMon, 25 Jan 2021 17:46:57 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.6.3\n    * Fix --start-at not handling URL-encoded file:/// paths properly. Notably,\n      this also fixes feh not displaying images with spaces or unicode\n      elements in their path when opened from a file manager.\n\nSat, 09 Jan 2021 12:28:06 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.6.2\n    * Fix save_filelist not respecting --output-dir\n    * Fix file descriptor leak when attempting to load truncated image files.\n      The issue was introduced in v3.6.\n\nSun, 06 Dec 2020 08:34:15 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.6.1\n    * Fix excessive memory consumption when showing long-running slideshows\n      with thousands to tens of thousands of images and feh has been compiled\n      with exif=1 (see https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/553)\n    * Fix memory leak when showing long-running slideshows with relatively few\n      images and feh has been compiled with exif=1 (ibid.)\n    * Fix memory leak when reloading an image and feh has been compiled with\n      exif=1\n    * Fix memory leak in --draw-exif\n    * Fix memory leak when reloading HTTP files with --no-conversion-cache\n\nMon, 30 Nov 2020 19:44:47 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.6\n    * Add flip and rotate options to the menu\n    * Improve unloadable image detection time (e.g. for large video files) by\n      checking a file's header before passing it to Imlib2. For rarely used\n      image formats, there is a very small chance that an image which could be\n      loaded by feh 3.5 is reported as unloadable by feh 3.6 due to this\n      change. Set FEH_SKIP_MAGIC=1 to bypass the header check in this case. See\n      <https://phab.enlightenment.org/T8739> and\n      <https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/505> for details.\n\n\nSat, 29 Aug 2020 08:49:08 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.5\n    * Enable --version-sort on systems without strverscmp support. This\n      works by bundling the strverscmp of musl libc with feh and using it\n      when feh is compiled without the verscmp flag (i.e., when the system\n      libc does not provide the verscmp function). Patch by Tim van der Molen\n    * Add %a format specifier (slideshow state: \"playing\" / \"paused\")\n    * Fix crashes when combining --reload and --multiwindow\n\nFri, 29 May 2020 23:52:35 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.4.1\n    * Fix lossless rotate not being lossless when using feh with Imlib2 v1.6\n      or later\n\nSat, 11 Apr 2020 09:51:01 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.4\n    * Images loaded via HTTPS/curl, ImageMagick, and dcraw are now cached\n      by default to decrease image load time on subsequent slideshow passes.\n      Caching is disabled when using `--reload` and can also be disabled with\n      the new `--no-conversion-cache` option. Suggestion and initial patch by\n      Awal Garg.\n    * Handle SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGQUIT signals while loading images using libcurl\n      < v7.32. Patch by <https://github.com/c99pedant>.\n    * \"feh --start-at URL\" now loads a single-image slideshow displaying URL.\n      This allows feh.desktop to handle URLs as well as ordinary files.\n      file:/// URLs are treated as local files, so \"feh --start-at file:///...\"\n      without filelist arguments behaves just like \"feh --start-at ...\"\n      (i.e., feh will load the entire directory and start the slideshow at ...)\n    * Fix a memory leak when repeatedly cycling through slideshows containing\n      images loaded via libcurl, ImageMagick or dcraw.\n\nTue, 03 Dec 2019 17:27:46 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.3\n    * New option --class allows setting the X11 class hint per feh instance\n      (patch by Olof-Joachim Frahm)\n    * Improve handling of NULL returns from Imlib2 calls (patch by Ben Boeckel)\n    * Fix compilation with libcurl < v7.32\n\nMon, 22 Jul 2019 20:17:03 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.2.1\n    * Use --no-fehbg option in ~/.fehbg. This fixes cases where an X11\n      setup change may inadvertently alter the commandline stored in .fehbg.\n    * Fix insufficient error handling when updating ~/.fehbg. Previously,\n      a stat() error may have caused .fehbg to be update with excessive file\n      permissions (patch by Tobias Stoeckmann)\n    * Fix TOCTTOU when setting the file mode of ~/.fehbg\n      (patch by Tobias Stoeckmann)\n\nWed, 10 Jul 2019 17:40:29 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.2\n    * Build feh with inotify=1 to automatically reload changed files in\n      slideshow mode. Introduces the inotify build flag and the --auto-reload\n      option.\n    * Reload current image(s) when receiving SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 in single-image\n      slideshows or in multiwindow mode\n\nSun, 17 Feb 2019 08:41:53 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Releasev v3.1.3\n    * Fix missing filename in ~/.fehbg when using --no-xinerama on a feh\n      binary compiled with xinerama=1. This issue was introduced in v3.1.2.\n\nMon, 11 Feb 2019 17:24:13 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.1.2\n    * Fix missing filenames in ~/.fehbg when using --bg-* on directories and/or\n      with --randomize\n    * Fix repeated --slideshow-delay/-D option not properly overriding the\n      'start paused' flag\n    * Fix repeated --info option not properly overriding the 'draw info' flag\n\nFri, 07 Dec 2018 22:51:15 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.1.1\n    * Decrease libcurl timeout from indefinite to 30 minutes. This should\n      be sufficient even for use cases with unusually high timeouts (just in\n      case anyone wants to do interplanetary slideshows), while at the same\n      time avoiding stalls in unattended slideshows when encountering\n      temporary network issues.\n    * Handle SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGQUIT signals while loading images using libcurl.\n      Previously, signals were ignored during a (possibly slow) libcurl\n      network transfer, which was not intended behaviour.\n\nWed, 21 Nov 2018 19:37:34 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.1\n    * Running \"feh --start-at .../file.jpg\" without specifying images,\n      directories or filelists to load is now equivalent to running\n      \"feh --start-at .../file.jpg $(dirname .../file.jpg)\". This way, it is\n      possible to view a specific file and browse all other files in the\n      corresponding directory. This is especially useful when starting feh\n      from file managers.\n    * Introduce fuzzy matching in --start-at: If the specified path is not\n      found in the file list, feh now resorts to comparing basenames (i.e.,\n      file names without the directory components). This allows calls\n      like \"feh --start-at cat.jpg ~/Pictures\", which led to a file not found\n      error in previous versions.\n    * Respect -j / --output-dir when using save_image or save_filelist actions.\n\nFri, 09 Nov 2018 17:17:15 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v3.0\n    * Remove deprecated webcam scripts (feh-cam and gen-cam-menu)\n    * Remove deprecated collage mode (-c/--collage)\n    * Remove deprecated option --cycle-once (use --on-last-slide=quit instead)\n    * Remove deprecated option --menu-bg\n    * Change default save_filelist key from \"f\" to \"L\" (mnemonic: fileList)\n    * Change default toggle_fullscreen key from \"v\" to \"f\" as this is also\n      used by mplayer, mpv and similar\n    * flip and rotation (keys \"<\", \">\", \"|\", and \"_\") no longer change the\n      underlying file. This leaves delete (\"Ctrl+Delete\") as the only\n      destructive action which is enabled by default\n    * Add option --edit, which makes flip and rotation change the underlying\n      file as well as the displayed image. This was the default behaviour in\n      feh 1.x and 2.x\n\nSat, 27 Oct 2018 19:46:48 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v2.28.1\n    * Do not ignore quit signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGQUIT) during preload\n    * Add missing EXIF orientations 2, 4, 5, and 7 (when built with exif=1,\n      patch by Olof-Joachim Frahm)\n    * Improve randomness on non-glibc systems\n\nMon, 17 Sep 2018 21:17:04 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v2.28\n    * Decrease loading time for RAW images by utilizing dcraw to display the\n      embedded JPEG preview (patch by <https://github.com/ulteq>)\n    * Rename --magick-timeout to --conversion-timeout. --magick-timeout is\n      now deprecated and will be removed in a future release\n    * Fix unintened aliasing in rotated images whose rotation is not a\n      multiple of 90 degrees (patch by <https://github.com/ulteq>)\n    * New option: --on-last-slide=hold|quit|resume.\n      hold will cause feh to stop advancing beyond the last slide (patch by\n      <https://github.com/ulteq>), quit replaces --cycle-once (which is now\n      deprecated), and resume is the default (continue at the first image).\n\nTue, 17 Jul 2018 17:33:10 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v2.27.1\n    * Fix feh occasionally becoming unresponsive when asked to terminate\n      via SIGINT/SIGQUIT/SIGTERM (based on a patch by\n      <https://github.com/giladogit>)\n    * Fix --keep-zoom-vp issues introduced in 2.27\n      (patch by <https://github.com/ulteq>)\n\nThu, 28 Jun 2018 17:26:54 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v2.27\n    * Fix size_to_image (\"w\") command when both --scale-down and --keep-zoom-vp\n      are enabled\n    * Fix --auto-zoom not being triggered on window resize events when\n      --scale-down is enabled\n    * Fix --auto-zoom conflicting with manual zoom\n    * Fix feh_draw_checks not taking the zoom level into account properly\n    * Prevent --zoom <percent> from blocking --scale-down in fullscreen / fixed\n      geometry mode\n    * Prevent --keep-zoom-vp from blocking the dynamic window resizing\n      mechanism\n    * Prevent automatic recalculation of the zoom ratio when --keep_zoom_vp\n      is enabled\n    * All patches provided by <https://github.com/ulteq>. Thanks a lot!\n\nTue, 26 Jun 2018 10:33:04 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v2.26.4\n    * Correctly save --bg-max in ~/.fehbg (patch by Sebastian Bickerle)\n\nFri, 18 May 2018 22:58:02 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v2.26.3\n    * Properly escape --image-bg argument in ~/.fehbg (broken in 2.26.1)\n\nSat, 12 May 2018 16:33:56 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v2.26.2\n    * Show correct filelist position in windows opened from thumbnail mode.\n      Note that navigation is still not supported in those windows\n    * Improve support for key input from stdin\n    * Do not push menus off the screen when hitting screen limits\n\nFri, 11 May 2018 15:11:17 +0200  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v2.26.1\n    * Restore pre-2.21 ~/.fehbg behaviour.

Note that --no-recursive is the default behaviour of feh.\n      This option is mostly useful to override a --recursive set in a theme or\n      shell alias\n    * Patch by Richard Molitor: Improve --scale-down in tiling environments.\n      This fixes flickering when changing images at the cost of slightly\n      less apaptive scale-down behaviour: Window size changes are now only\n      processed when the active image is changed\n    * --action and --action[1..9] now support action titles\n      (e.g. --action '[some title]some-command %F'), which are displayed\n      instead of the specified shell command. Note that the title must not\n      start with a space. Titles starting with a space are treated as part of\n      of the command so that actions like '[ -L %F ] && foo' still work\n\nThu, 18 Feb 2016 20:40:19 +0100  Birte Friesel <derf+feh@finalrewind.org>\n\n* Release v2.14.2\n    * make test: Ignore results on arm and mips since they expose a bug in\n      Imlib2 1.4.7 and/or giflib 5.1.2.

Caches the bg pixmap for the\n    image (which doesn't change when you're just editing a caption) so only\n    the overlay needs to be re-rendered on each change to the caption.\n    Definitely makes a difference when editing captions on a large, fullscreen\n    image.\n\nSun Dec 22 22:59:31 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Tweak event handling - don't nuke queued keyevents when we're accepting\n    input for caption entry.\n\nSun Dec 22 13:50:16 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Fixed wrapping for long lines with no spaces\n  * Caption editing, also requested by David Blackman <david@whizziwig.com>\n    Hit 'c', edit caption, enter to confirm the changes or Escape to revert.\n    (Only when --captions-path has been specified).\n  * Spotted a couple of minor bugs as I went through stuff, fixed those two.\n\nSat Dec 21 20:32:40 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * New option --captions-path. Specify a path (relative to each image) to a\n    directory with captions in and feh will overlay them on the image. It even\n    does text wrapping and centering!\n    Example, run feh --captions-path captions testimages\n    for image testimages/donna1.jpg, feh will look for a caption in\n    testimages/captions/donna1.jpg.txt\n  * This feature was requested by David Blackman <david@whizziwig.com>\n\nThu Dec 19 23:09:19 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Fixed bug - segv when last image in slideshow is deleted.\n\nThu Dec 05 16:04:24 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Released 1.2.3\n\nThu Dec 05 03:32:29 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Got rid of black background for the \"draw filename\" and zoom display\n    texts.

I prefer the old way but that way doesn't\n    allow keyboard menu control.\n\nWed Dec 04 21:30:29 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Found a couple of case statements without breaks in options.c\n  * New default menu, tweaked the menus a little, added code to specify the\n    menu bg image border and let the user tweak it.\n\nSun Nov 24 22:47:43 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Patch from Daniel Ashbrook <anjiro@cc.gatech.edu> to bind a key (v) to\n    switching between window and fullscreen mode\n\nSun Oct 20 22:45:01 2002 EDT, Paul Duncan <pabs@pablotron.org>\n\n  * added requested screen-clip option (allows you to disable window size\n    clipping based on screen geometry; ie, you can make pathologically large\n    windows, assuming you have the images to do so)\n  * disabled xinerama geometry check when using feh to set the background.\n  * cleaned up spelling and capitalization in menus\n\nSun Oct 20 20:12:23 2002 EDT, Paul Duncan <pabs@pablotron.org>\n\n  * src/support.c: xinerama bugfix from Jon Bernard <jbernard@roanoke.edu>\n  * src/options.c: added 'Use Xinerama' toggle to option menu\n  * src/options.c: changed 'Keep http files' to 'Keep HTTP Files'\n    (pet peeve ;P)\n  * src/options.c: added 'Auto-Zoom' toggle to option menu\n  * feh.1: added info about --xinerama flag\n  * AUTHORS: added Jon Bernard\n\nSun Oct 20 14:49:46 2002 EDT, Paul Duncan <pabs@pablotron.org>\n\n  * New beveled, off-white background image for menus.  I made it the\n    default after consulting with the boss (eg Sue Gilbert).  Tom thinks\n    it's okay too.\n\nSun Oct 20 05:48:40 2002 EDT  Paul Duncan <pabs@pablotron.org>\n\n  * Added Xinerama support.  Currently defaults to fullscreen on the\n    first head (this can be fixed with a little work).\n  * Added winwidget_{move,get_geometry}();\n\nWed Sep 11 19:53:31 BST 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * REALLY release 1.2.1\n\nWed Sep 11 19:52:24 BST 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * autoconf fixes\n  * throw out the damn non-free \"public domain\" fonts.\n  * stick in yudit.ttf. it's not as pretty, but it is, apparently, DFSG\n    compliant etc.\n\nWed Sep 11 19:44:25 BST 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Release 1.2.1\n\nWed Sep 11 19:43:24 BST 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Patch from Panagiotis Issaris <takis.issaris@skynet.be>\n    - adds support for using the numeric keypad to scroll and zoom the image.\n\nWed Jul 31 22:31:21 BST 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Fixed --draw-filename (was --draw_filename but not documented as such -\n    oops, that's been broken a terribly long time :))\n\nTue Apr 16 19:19:11 BST 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Release 1.2.0\n\nFri Mar 08 21:04:07 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Patch from Omar Harriott <omar.harriott@csun.edu>\n  * fix filelist handling for filenames with spaces.\n\nFri Feb 08 21:52:48 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Don't segv on save if win->file is NULL, use the mode + .png for the\n    filename, or noname.png as a last resort. Reported by mousey.\n\nSun Feb 03 19:28:19 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Erp. s/wprintf/weprintf - I didn't notice the typo because wprintf is a\n    wide character printf. Luckily someone compiled feh on PPC and noticed the\n    bug.\n\nWed Jan 30 13:54:29 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * New menu colour/style - \"feh -Tblack src/testimages\"\n\nWed Jan 30 13:29:21 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Patch from Jens Laas <jens.laas@data.slu.se>\n  * Adds --zoom option. Here's what he said about it:\n    > What it does:\n    > zooms images by a fixed amount but never larger than the screen.\n    > Why:\n    > This is nice if you got a collection of images where some are small and\n    > can stand a small zoom. Large images are unaffected.\n    > When does it work, and how?\n    > You have to be in fullscreen mode _and_ have auto-zoom turned on.\n    > \"feh -FZ --zoom 130 imagefile\" will do the trick.\n    > -zoom percent  -- is the new switch.\n    >                   100 = orignal size,\n    >                   130 is 30% larger.\n  * I tweaked it abit to allow it to work (differently) without -Z.\n    feh -F --zoom 200 will zoom each image to 200%, regardless of the\n    resulting size. feh -FZ --zoom 200 will zoom each image up to a maximum\n    of 200%, but without generating an image larger than the screen.\n\nSat Jan 26 16:20:43 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Use giblib fontstyles for menus, instead of hardcoding the shadow.\n  * Let users choose menu style with --menu-style. Standard giblib\n    semantics.\n\nSat Jan 26 15:34:26 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * make sure fullscreen windows are really fullscreen.\n  * Haha! feh uses giblib now, pointless me maintaining two list\n    implementations and two imlib2 wrappers. Plus now I can add fontstyles :)\n\nSat Jan 26 14:10:54 GMT 2002  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n  * Goodbye, non-free fonts, hello, free font. Turns out the guy who made\n    those \"public domain\" fonts doesn't actually want to release them under a\n    free license, so they gotta go.\n\nMon Jan 14 19:51:18 2002  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed --bg-seamless from the commandline.\n\t* When you set a bg with feh, it now stores the necessary\n\tcommandline to restore that bg in ~/.fehbg. So for non-E\n\twindowmanagers, that don't remember the bg, you can put \"eval `cat\n\t$HOME/.fehbg\" in your .xsession, and your setting are remembered\n\twhen you restart X.\n\nSun Jan 13 21:12:42 2002  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Gah. imlib_image_set_format(\"JPG\") does not work, yet jpg\n\tdoes. I think that's dumb :( This work around makes saving work\n\twith uppercase filenames.\n\nSat Jan 12 03:01:59 2002  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Stopped the bg code uselessly creating temp images when not\n\tneeded.\n\nSun Jan  6 01:37:40 2002  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Use < or > keys to do in place edit rotations, 90 degrees left\n\tor right.\n\nSun Jan  6 01:16:04 2002  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fix unlikely but naughty segv.\n\nSun Jan  6 00:49:35 2002  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Some basic in place editing. Feh is not an editor, but when\n\tviewing images I just grabbed from the digicam, it's really useful\n\tto fix up the ones needing rotation.\n\nTue Sep  4 23:47:42 2001  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* --loadable and --unloadable modes should run --action on\n\tmatching files, fixed.\n\nSun Aug 26 18:06:51 2001  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Slightly tweaked menu sliding behaviour.\n\t* About to release 1.1.0.\n\nSat Aug 25 21:58:31 2001  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Show zoom and new image size when zooming.\n\nSat Aug 25 18:36:30 2001  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* No need for cam to use -w as it spawns multiple feh processes.\n\t* Can use options menu to switch between fullscreen and window\n\tmodes.\n\t* Some fullscreen code cleanups. Now a per-window option.\n\t* Menu code cleanups.\n\nSat Aug 25 17:46:35 2001  Tom Gilbert  <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed --geometry mode. When you resized the window it would still\n\tcenter/size to the size you specified in --geometry. I think\n\t--geometry should just say \"don't change the window size\", but the\n\tuser should still be able to :)\n\t* Added a new menu option for freezing/unfreezing the window size.\n\nSat Aug 25 02:49:54 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* okay. feh menus now support toggleable items.\n\t* I was gonna use ellipses for the toggle state, but I found that\n\tI had broken ellipses in imlib2 a while back (at least I think it\n\twas me). So it's rectangles. I fixed imlib2 now, but there won't\n\tbe a release for a while.\n\t* A couple of options can now be configured through the menus,\n\twill add more in time.\n\t* some other stuff I forget, I'm tired :)\n\nFri Aug 24 08:44:46 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Even better, you can copy a pixmap between displays :) This is\n\tmuch faster than Xput/get. Cheers raster.\n\nThu Aug 23 19:04:57 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay. So you can't copy a pixmap between two displays using\n\tXCopyArea :) Fair enough, back to blechy XPut/XGetImage. It works\n\tnow with or without E, and Eterm is happy. Managed to avoid\n\tleaking data into X through imlib2 or my own cached GCs, which is\n\tnice :)\n\t* Tested commandline too, works great with E or without. Finally.\n\t* Also fixed a bug with the non-E centering code, it would only\n\thave really worked for square images before ;-)\n\nWed Aug 22 22:44:13 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay, setting the pixmap and atoms works now, bar an imlib2 bug\n\twe need to fix. So right now, rather than dump core, I leak X\n\tconnections whenever you set a BG. No big hit unless you do\n\tthousands, and it's only temporary until we fix imlib2.\n\t* This is mainly for raster to check out right now.\n\nWed Aug 22 17:01:08 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay, setting bg from cmdline when not running E was broken,\n\tbasically because we didn't XFlush before exiting. My bad.\n    * Ugh. I'm trying to emulate Esetroot, by setting the atoms needed to\n    tell Eterm where the bg pixmap is. Of course, when feh exits, the\n    pixmap is cleaned up by X, unless I do an XSetCloseDownMode(disp,\n    RetainPermanent); However, this means all my crap hangs around, I want\n    it to be cleaned up. So anyone know how I can make the pixmap stick\n    around in X, without leaving windows and other pixmaps there too?\n    (Esetroot lets it all hang out basically, but it's non graphical and\n    can afford to. It always exits after doing it's job and the next time\n    you run it, it frees the last pixmap it made).\n\nMon Aug 20 20:58:47 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* If you specify a font that can't be loaded, feh attempts to fall\n\tback to 'fixed', then '*'.\n\nSat Aug 18 19:15:22 2001  Tom Gilber <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added, 'w, W' and a menu option to resize the window to the\n\tcurrent image dimensions.\n\nThu Aug 16 23:07:33 2001  Tom Gilbert <tom@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added 'x' to close a window but not exit everything.\n\nThu Aug 16 00:23:26 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fook. Broke backgrounding in E for 1.0, enlightenment IPC does\n\tNOT support \"filename with a space\" at all. You can't do\n\tit. ARGH. Okay, so back that out.\n\t* Add setting bg from commandline, quite useful because it'll use\n\tE if it's there or fallback to X, i.e. it should always do the\n\tright thing (hopes).\n\t* FYI, it's --bg-scale, --bg-center, --bg-seamless, --bg-tile.\n\nMon Aug 13 22:21:44 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed bug when using -g to reduce image proportionally,\n\tcalculated zoom was incorrect because I am a dick.\n\nSun Aug 12 18:13:39 2001  Till Adam  <till@adam-lilienthal.de>\n\n\t* slide menus to the left and/or up if they are off the screen and the\n\tcursor is close to the right and/or bottom edge of the screen\n\nSun Aug 12 00:24:38 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Uh that's not all I changed in the last commit.\n\t* Panning is different now. It used to be ctrl+button 3, but this\n\twas redefinable using cmdline/theme options. Now, instead, it's\n\tcombined with the next image button.\n\t* ie. by default a single click of button 1 will change images, if\n\tthere is more than one image in the slideshow. Clicking and\n\tdragging button 1 will pan, if the image is bigger than its\n\twindow. I find this more convenient, but let me know.\n\nSun Aug 12 00:15:06 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Oops. Fixed bug with zooming out larger images when -g is used.\n\t* Other fixes.\n\nSat Aug 11 23:29:32 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed annoying bug where feh would limit window size to desktop\n\tsize only on the first image.\n\nSat Aug 11 23:20:09 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added -g, --geometry setting to fix feh's geometry. Stops\n\trepeated resizing when browsing lots of pics. Please test this for\n\tme as I want to get 1.0 out soon :)p\n\nSat Aug 11 01:41:21 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Add image and filelist saving to context menus.\n\t* Tidy menus.\n\nSat Aug 11 01:25:15 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed missing break; in keyevent handler\n\t* Changed the slideshow pause key from \"s,S\" to \"h,H\"\n\t* New slideshow key \"s,S\" to save the current image to a unique\n\tfilename (generated in the same way as saved webcam images).\n\t* New slideshow key \"f,F\" to save the current filelist, also to a\n\tunique filename.\n\t* Little cleanups.\n\nThu Aug  9 23:57:41 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Oops. Went back to getopt_long. getopt_long_only is cool if you\n\tonly have a few cmdline options, but feh has a bunch and most\n\tshort option combos were coming up as \"ambiguous\". i.e. feh -Vw\n\tactually ignores the -w. Fixed.\n\nThu Aug  9 23:39:02 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Remembered some things I changed a while back and didn't put in\n\there, but they need to be in here or I'll forget forever.\n\t* Fixed a race with multiple webcam-viewing feh instances by\n\tadding feh PID to the tmp filename used to cache the downloaded\n\timages. Other fixups to the remote-getting code.\n\nThu Aug  9 23:16:58 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Load menu font just once and keep it around.\n\t* New menu backgrounds.\n\t* Fix detection of bad fonts.\n\t* Allow use of --fontpath multiple times to add many paths\n\tto the fontpath.\n\nThu Aug  9 22:45:05 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Progressive loading is gone. It's useless in imlib2 because\n\timlib2 can't load from filehandles, it's real application is\n\tgone. Plus people say without seeing the image load it \"feels\"\n\tfaster. This also simplifies a bunch of code and I feel cleaner\n\twithout it.\n\t* Less pointless redraws, should be faster switching images now.\n\t* Other bits.\n\nThu Feb 15 11:25:45 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* A patch from labisso (David LaBissoniere <labiss@usit.net>)\n      to allow pausing of slideshows. Handy.\n\nSun Jan 28 13:20:45 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* cam was using -Cwebcam, should be -Twebcam\n\t* default generated ~/.fehrc used --keep-http in webcam mode, this\n\tis probably not what most people want for the default, so I\n\tremoved it. Either blow away your ~/.fehrc or make this change\n\tyourself to get it....\n\t* Maybe fixed a memleak. I hope so, but it will take 3 days of\n\trunning cam to find out :-)\n\t* After an idea and partial patch from KainX, added -G,\n\t--wget-timestamp to use wget timestamping when downloading http\n\timages. Useful when watching webcams, the idea is that wget only\n\tdownloads the webcam if it has changed since the last time. Nice\n\tbandwidth saver. However, there is currently a bug in wget that\n\tprevents this from working. KainX found it and I think he reported\n\tit, so the next version should contain a fix.\n\nWed Jan 17 20:33:31 2001  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Reverted to using wget by default - the builtin stuff isn't\n\tquite so tolerant about hangups and stuff, it kinda just blocks a\n\tlot. Needs more work before replacing use of wget, which \"just\n\tworks\".\n\nMon Dec 11 19:25:10 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added a super-sweet patch from Benjamin Elijah Griffin\n\t<bgriffin@cddb.com> to actually implement the builtin http\n\tcollection I started ages ago. I screwed with it only slightly,\n\tit's a great patch. So now we can grab http images without\n\tspawning a subprocess, and I have to say here it seems a little\n\tfaster too ;-)\n\t* Added -Q, --wget option to use wget to grab http data just in\n\tcase you need to use a proxy, or something else stops the builtin\n\tstuff from working...\n\t* Misc tidyups etc..\n\n\nTue Nov 28 00:45:38 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added support for --slideshow-delay as a float. -D0.25 for\n\texample.\n\nSat Oct 28 23:32:11 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Better check for imlib2.\n\t* Only create files in current dir if keeping http images. Ones\n\tthat will be deleted on exit go in /tmp.\n\nSun Oct 22 02:01:33 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Swapped the default right mouse button config. You now hold\n\tctrl to pan, or don't to get menus.\n\t* Changed --no-menu-ctrl-mask to --menu-ctrl-mask\n\t* Added --no-pan-ctrl-mask\n\t* Use the options feh --no-pan-ctrl-mask --menu-ctrl-mask to\n\tsimulate the old behaviour, or add that line to ~/.fehrc to keep\n\tit.\n\t* Need to change all the --*-ctrl-mask options to booleans so it\n\tis properly configurable, I think.\n\nSat Oct 21 23:22:09 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed the -k option (to save files viewed by http). It now saves\n\tthe files into the *current* directory, with better filenames, eg\n\tfeh_000001_image.jpg for a file called image.jpg.\n\t* Removed the use of the evil mkstemp function, not needed any\n\tmore.\n\nFri Aug 25 16:41:29 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* rotation wasn't reset when image changed in fullscreen mode\n\nSat Aug 19 16:07:29 2000  Paul Duncan  <pabs@pablotron.org>\n\n\t* added multiple key loading to cam.  also updated the\n\tdocumentation and chnaged the version number to 0.3.\n\nFri Aug  4 12:09:29 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Sweet patch from Eric, changes window title to \"Reloading:\n\t<Former title>\" when reloading an image. Neato :)\n\nThu Aug  3 23:11:23 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Another fine patch from Eric Dorland, allows the configuration\n\tof the reload button, --reload-button NUM. Also patches cam to use\n\tbutton 1 to reload webcams :) Nifty ;)\n\nThu Aug  3 23:04:38 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Patch from David LaBissoniere <labiss@usit.net>\n\tAdds a --start-at NUM option for jumping to number NUM of the\n\tfilelist (either from a file or the commandline).\n\t* Thanks David.\n\nFri Jul 28 21:07:32 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added --scale-down to automatically scale images down if they\n\tare too big to fit on the screen. Only works with -P right now\n\tbecause I am lame, but I'm on the case...\n\t* The start of some builtin http code to replace wget. Part-done\n\tand #ifdef'd out for now...\n\nSun Jul  9 00:03:27 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed an ickle memleak when reloading a rotated image.\n\nTue Jun 27 17:16:21 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* More --title stuff from Eric. It now works in thumbnail mode,\n\tand an additional --thumb-title can be used to set the title of\n\tthe individual thumbnail windows.\n\nSun Jun 25 03:39:57 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Spec file fixes (I suck).\n\t* Okay, if DEBUG is defined, then --debug-level NUM shows only\n\tdebug messages with a level equal to or below that\n\tspecified. Right now I'm using 0-5.\n\nSun Jun 25 02:46:58 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Started reworking the debugging macros. Nothing to see here, yet\n\t;)\n\t* Another patch from Eric Dorland, makes --title work in all the\n\tother modes but thumbnail mode.\n\nSat Jun 24 23:43:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hehehe. Patch from Eric Dorland <dorland@lords.com> arrived\n\tjust after the release ;-)\n\t* New format specifiers, --title works in multiwindow mode, and\n\t--title is passed through feh_printf, so the new format specifiers\n\tmay be used in it... Coolio.\n\nSat Jun 24 21:27:05 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Released 0.9.9.\n\nSat Jun 24 19:06:26 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* In multiwindow mode, handle events whilst opening windows. This\n\tis very handy for when you accidentally do feh -rw / and have 14\n\tmillion images opening. 'q' will quit at any time ;)\n\nSat Jun 24 18:57:22 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixes for blending transparent stuff onto transparent stuff.\n\t* Reindent and cleanup prior to release.\n\nSat Jun 24 18:34:39 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fix for a reload when rotated.\n\nSat Jun 24 18:27:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Check panning after a zoom, move within constraints if\n\tnecessary.\n\nSat Jun 24 18:15:35 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Constraints for panning.\n\nSat Jun 24 17:00:59 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Context menu for thumbnail mode.\n\nSat Jun 24 16:44:19 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fix for segv when tring to get image info for a generated (not\n\ton fs) image.\n\nSat Jun 24 16:28:11 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fix for rotation and panning and zooming in fullscreen mode.\n\nSat Jun 24 12:21:02 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added --title, with a nice clean patch from Eric Dorland\n\t<dorland@lords.com>, allows you to set the window title to be used\n\tfor slideshow mode. He also modified cam to use this to label it's\n\twindows. A combined perl and C patch - neato ;-)\n\nSat Jun 24 00:46:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* New menu item, Reset. It resets the zoom/pan/rotate etc.\n\t* Currently only with -P (to be fixed), a reload does not force a\n\treset like it did before, so you can zoom a webcam and not have it\n\treset on reload.\n\nSat Jun 24 00:13:53 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Thumbnails, when clicked, now all open the clicked image in the\n\tsame window. Much better for browsing.\n\t* Menu fixups, more efficient now. Also, better context menus,\n\thaving the right options for the right window types.\n\t* If you open a thumbnail, and then delete it or remove it from\n\tthe filelist, the thumbnail view will update to show the\n\tfact. This is cool :-)\n\nFri Jun 23 17:15:07 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Depreciated the FEH_OPTIONS envrionment variable in favour of\n\tthe configuration file themes.\n\nFri Jun 23 14:46:21 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Mwahahaha. Asynchronous events for index, thumbnails and\n\tcollages. All events are handled while the images are\n\tgenerated. You can quit, bring up menus, zoom, pan and rotate, all\n\twhilst the image is still being created. Much better.\n\t* Pass the progress function around instead of using the\n\tcontext. Kills two bugs.\n\nFri Jun 23 14:11:56 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Documentation fixups.\n\t* --thumnbails can also be called with -t now.\n\t* --title-font no longer has a short option.\n\t* --theme is now also -T.\n\t* Release preparations.\n\nFri Jun 23 12:54:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* You can now select --bg trans to give indexes, collages,\n\tmontages and thumbnail selectors a transparent background.\n\nFri Jun 23 12:18:44 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed a couple of minor bugs\n\t* You can now open the same image multiple times... If you really\n\twant to...\n\nFri Jun 23 11:37:56 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Thumbnails now stored in a linked list.\n\nThu Jun 22 23:57:33 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Optimisations to thumb hilites. Only show hilite when you can\n\tclick to open an image, don't show when over emtpy space, and\n\tdon't re-render if the selection hasn't changed from the last\n\tmouseover. Speeds it up a lot.\n\nThu Jun 22 23:49:07 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Now thumbnails show as they load too.\n\t* AND :-)\n\t* Thumbnail hiliting on mouseover from richlowe. Coolio ;-)\n\nThu Jun 22 23:32:45 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Same for collage mode :)\n\nThu Jun 22 23:28:33 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Woop. Something I should've done a WHILE ago. If progressive\n\tloading is enabled (ie not -P), you can see the index/montage\n\tbeing created in front of your eyes ;-) It's sweet.\n\t* Next I will make it respond to events during the creation\n\t(quiting/zooming while still creating), and make it work for\n\tthumbnail and collage modes too.\n\nThu Jun 22 22:23:48 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fix for trying to reload a montage\n\t* Rewrite of all linked-list code to a more generic form so I can\n\tdo more with it. I may have introduced bugs in this (big) rewrite,\n\tso test test test ;-)\n\t* Misc fixups\n\nWed Jun 21 23:49:00 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Can set background from multiwindow and thumbnail modes now.\n\nWed Jun 21 22:43:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Initial thumbnail mode, thanks to patches from richlowe and\n\tmodifications by me. Nice work dude. More to come, right now\n\tthere's just the click (although it works with a panned or zoomed\n\tthumbnail list). To come - opening thumbs in a single window,\n\thiliting, and hey, the rest will be a surprise, okay? ;-)\n\t* This is *initial* btw. I plan to properly add this to index and\n\tmontage modes, as it needn't be a seperate mode. There's lots of\n\tduplication in the source right now, which needs to be cut down.\n\nTue Jun 20 20:02:57 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed mousebutton swapping option code. It was broken for\n\tcertain combinations, now all seems well.\n\t* Found a use for ctrl+button1 for now, it just blurs/sharpens the\n\timage dynamically - for shits and giggles. It is somewhat spoiled\n\tby the fact that imlib2 currently doesn't seem to care what radius\n\tyou pass to imlib_sharpen_image(), it always does the same thing.\n\nMon Jun 19 17:47:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added new background setting mode. \"Set seamless.\" It's purdy.\n\nMon Jun 19 14:18:10 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Mwahaha. Now the window is resized when rotation starts (to fit\n\tthe rotated image in). Also, checks are drawn properly behind the\n\timage, and rotation works well in combination with pan and zoom.\n\t* Now that all that's done, rotation is slow as shit ;) We'll see\n\tif we can speed that up next ;)\n\nSun Jun 18 21:49:35 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* No more eesh. We use E ipc properly now. IPC code pinched from\n\tEterm - thanks KainX.\n\nSun Jun 18 19:38:02 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Zooming is mostly fixed now. Works much better. A few little\n\ttweaks and we'll be laughing :-)\n\nSun Jun 18 16:11:47 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* More menu styles. Remove your ~/.fehrc (let it regenerate) and\n\trun feh -t wood, feh -t aluminium or feh -t aqua to see them.\n\nSun Jun 18 14:53:17 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Better eesh availability determination, and a check that E is\n\tactually being used at the time, too ;)\n\nSun Jun 18 13:46:59 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Now feh will query eesh for the number of desktops a user\n\thas. If eesh is there, and there is more than one, the background\n\tsetting menu will offer a choice of which desktop to set.\n\nSun Jun 18 03:47:58 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay. Thanks to richlowe and me, the bg setting is getting\n\tpretty cool now. It uses eesh under E, but if it can't find it,\n\tnicely falls back to X calls. There are more options to come\n\t(choosing which desktop etc), but for now, things are pretty sweet\n\t;-)\n\nSun Jun 18 01:29:16 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* The first part of some background setting code from richlowe\n\t<richlowe@btinternet.com> - more to come, it'll be sweet.\n\t* Doesn't work yet btw, so don't get excited ;)\n\nSun Jun 18 00:40:28 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* New option, --rcfile FILE. Uses FILE instead of the normal\n\t~/.fehrc or /etc/fehrc for parsing configs/themes from.\n\nSun Jun 18 00:26:06 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Now feh will write a default ~/.fehrc if none is found, but only\n\tif there is no /etc/fehrc in place already.\n\nSat Jun 17 23:46:32 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* A couple of nice new menu bgs from pabsmonkey.\n\t* The example.fehrc has theme entries for them, so if you copy it\n\tto ~/.fehrc, using feh --theme brushed will use the brushed menu\n\tbg. Same for --theme chrome.\n\nSat Jun 17 12:57:49 PDT 2000 Paul Duncan <pabs@pablotron.org>\n\n   * wget is now quiet by default (wget -q). it's verbose if the\n   -V or --verbose flag is passed to feh.  Your terminal will\n   thank you.\n   * mirrored the same change too cam.  cam -V or cam --verbose\n   will enable verbose mode for feh and the forked wgets.\n   * the second mouse button now zooms again, and the third button\n   pans.\n   * added menu-button option too (-4 or --menu-button). ctrl+the\n   menu button brings up the menu.  defaults to the right mouse\n   button, and you can set it to 0 for any button (including ones\n   >3, there's no bounds checking).  This feature is disabled by\n   the -N or --no-menus flag.\n\nSat Jun 17 20:41:24 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Apend ? and a random number to the image url for webcams so that\n\tthe image isn't cached. Much better.\n\nFri Jun 16 22:52:50 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Menus can have a background image now. There is a default one,\n\tcourtesy of Pablo P Duncan (http://10k.dhs.org/~dmron/arch.html).\n\t* You can use any image you like for the background, by using\n\t--menu-bg FILE to select one. I had a small amount of fun using\n\tBritney as my menu background. Strange, but true.\n\nWed Jun 14 18:53:06 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added --progress-gran NUM. Sets the progressive-loading\n\tgranularity to NUM, an integer between 0 and 100. This is the\n\tpercentage of the image to load before updating the display. 0 is\n\tsuper-smooth, but slightly slower than 100, which loads the whole\n\timage before showing anything. Use lower numbers to get\n\tresponsiveness over slow network connections...\n\nSat Jun 10 21:25:33 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Zooming is back, and it's as it was before. I'm still not happy\n\twith it, but it works again anyhow. Next: fix, fix, fix.\n\t* Don't forget, you need to hold control to get menus now...\n\nSat Jun 10 12:36:58 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Only render the current viewport. Big optimisation I should have\n\tdone earlier. Makes zooming big images smooooooooth ;-)\n\t* Nearly finished the zooming rewrite, but it's disabled right now\n\t(it's still a bit crappy).\n\nSat Jun 10 00:05:10 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed check drawing after resize. Edge resistance against *all*\n\tthe edges, not just two of them ;-)\n\nFri Jun  9 21:31:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fix fullscreen mode to work with new image placement code. Make\n\tit work with --auto-zoom and --stretch too.\n\t* Perform an antialiased pass after panning if needed.\n\nFri Jun  9 19:48:05 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Edge resistance when panning. Much better.\n\nThu Jun  8 22:02:50 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* First part of zooming/scaling rewrite. Only panning so far, but\n\tit works nice. Zooming is current *disabled*.\n\nSun Jun  4 15:44:05 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added a wrapper to imlib2. I was getting some subtle bugs from\n\tthe singleton context (accidentally leaving context_antialias on,\n\tnot blending when I should be etc), and to fix them I was adding\n\tlines and lines of context_set this, context_set that. I've\n\twrapped the imlib calls in an imlib1\n\tlots-of-params-per-function-call stylee, and now it's much more\n\treadable and harder to break.\n\t* In the process, made big speedups by not antialiasing when I\n\tneedn't, or blending when I shouldn't etc. Also blew away a few\n\thundred lines of context-setting.\n\nFri Jun  2 22:58:50 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed pixmap resizing bug properly this time ;-)\n\nThu Jun  1 19:36:19 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Correct oversite in sizing pixmaps.\n\nWed May 24 20:21:14 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Massively speeded up image rendering and therefore zooming by\n\tactually *thinking* about what I was doing and using a tiled\n\tpixmap GC and XFillRectangle for drawing the background\n\tcheckerboard pattern. Much better. I'll clean it up a bit\n\tnext.\n\nWed May 24 00:09:12 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed bug with --no-progressive and window resizing. The\n\trendering and resizing code is a *mess* now, which I'll have to\n\tfix tomorrow (lots of duplication and a complex codepath). But at\n\tleast it works properly right now :-)\n\nTue May 23 22:19:30 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Optimised event handling from nasty big switch() to a table of\n\tpointers to functions.\n\nSun May 21 20:53:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* About.png contributed by Phil Morris (marmot)\n\t<marmot@vennercs.com>\n\nSun May 21 10:01:39 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Gratituous eyecandy in the about box 'cos Boris asked nicely ;-)\n\nSat May 20 01:09:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Wired cam into the Makefile.am\n\nFri May 19 19:21:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* You can now use --action with list or customlists too. In these\n\tmodes, the action is run automatically for each file listed.\n\nThu May 18 21:34:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Quotes, escaped quotes and escaped spaces in config files work\n\tas one would expect. I think. Don't they?\n\nThu May 18 20:43:16 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* \\n now gets you a newline in a feh-interpreted string.\n\nThu May 18 20:26:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Changed how -l and -L work. -L is now --customlist, which takes\n\ta string argument. The string is a feh-printf format specifier,\n\tjust like those used for action definitions. (Eg %f for filename,\n\t%w for width etc). The format specifier is used to form the list\n\toutput for each file. Example usage:\n\tfeh -L \"<img src=\\\"%f\\\" alt=\\\"feh\\\" width=\\\"%w\\\" height=\\\"%h\\\">\" pr0n.png\n\tStuck a new theme in the example.fehrc config, and found how lame\n\tmy config parsing code is :-) Quotes and escaped quotes currently\n\t*do not* work right. I'm fixing it now :-)\n\nTue May 16 17:51:40 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Ignore duplicate MotionNotify events\n\t* Same for ConfigureNotify\n\t* Saved some wasted cycles\n\nMon May 15 22:49:07 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hehe. Now I made a release I can break stuff again =P You can\n\tresize the window again now, and it works okay, except zooming\n\tisn't quite right when the window is bigger than the image right\n\tnow. I have to redo *all* that zooming code over the next week\n\tor so 'cos it was shortsighted to start with :-(\n\nSun May 14 17:34:48 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* New \"Image Info\" submenu. It tells you stuff. About the\n\timage. Hence the name.\n\nSun May 14 16:03:53 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Reorganised and tidied the headers somewhat. Various cleanups.\n\nSat May 13 20:53:12 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Add -N, --no-menus option for people who Just Want The Pr0n [tm]\n\nSat May 13 20:35:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Now you can press 'r' to reload images too.\n\nSat May 13 20:24:18 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hide menu, *then* perform action. Otherwise hitting \"reload\" on\n\tan http:// image over a slow connection keeps the mouse grab until\n\tfinished. Messy ;-)\n\nSat May 13 19:54:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Make the menus slightly prettier. I wish I had an artistic bone\n\tsomewhere in my body...\n\nSat May 13 18:04:58 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Use realpath() to cleanup paths before sticking them in a\n\tfilelist. Added --menu-font, -M so that you can use whatever font\n\tyou like for menus.\n\nSat May 13 00:11:06 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Menus. They need some work, but are mostly good.\n\t* I owe many thanks to raster here, 'cos I pinched some functions\n        from efm to save time :-)\n\t* Added --auto-zoom. Currently only works with --no-progressive, I\n\tneed to fix that soonish...\n\nTue May  9 22:04:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Now --filelist is -f, relegating -font to -e. *shrug*.\n\nTue May  9 21:57:14 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Now --theme is -t instead of -C (duh).\n\nTue May  9 21:35:34 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Now --action is A, and --ignoreaspect is X.\n\nTue May  9 21:30:59 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Now randomize is -z, which makes a little more sense.\n\nTue May  9 21:15:57 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Swapped -g and -c so that --collage gets the -c it fits, and\n\trandomize gets -g. I need to rework all these short options,\n\tthey're a mess right now. Sorry if I break anyone's configs doing\n\tthis :-(\n\nTue May  9 21:09:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Removed -B, --booth, as it's just a combo of options now doable\n\tin the config file. I stuck it in the example config instead...\n\nMon May  8 22:38:11 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Don't apply colormods to each whole image. First scale it to\n\tthumbnail size, then apply the colormod to that.\n\nMon May  8 22:08:41 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Made --alpha actually do stuff. I finally grokked color\n\tmodifiers, and now they're fun ;-) Imlib2.h is really gonna need\n\tsome comments at some point though - I had proper trial-and-error\n\tfun and games there for a while ;-)\n\nMon May  8 21:58:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* D'oh! if(foo & bar) isn't quite the same as if(foo &&\n\tbar). Stupid cheap keyboards ;-)\n\nMon May  8 13:12:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fun with dmalloc\n\nMon May  8 13:10:12 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Ensure backgrounds of index and montage images are black by\n\tdefault. Imlib2's behaviour changed in this respect at some point.\n\nSun May  7 18:42:57 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed breakage (and segfault) when preloading images in verbose\n\tmode if any of the images are unloadable. Stupid typo.\n\nSun Apr 30 16:02:11 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added  -n, --reverse. Reverses the sort order.\n\tUse this to invert the order of the filelist. Eg to sort in\n\treverse width order, use -nSwidth\n\nSun Apr 30 15:13:25 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* In slideshow and muliwindow modes, DELETE now removes the\n\tcurrent file from the filelist. CTRL+DELETE deletes the files from\n\tthe filesystem and removes it from the filelist.\n\nSun Apr 30 14:48:04 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Filelists can now be saved to and loaded from files, very much\n\tlike the playlists used by music players.\n\t* Here's the details:\n            -e, --filelist FILE\n            This option is similar to the playlists used by music\n            software. If FILE exists, it will be read for a  list\n            of  files to load, in the order they appear. The for-\n            mat is a list of image filenames, absolute  or  rela-\n            tive to the current directory, one filename per line.\n            If FILE doesn't exist, it will be  created  from  the\n            internal  filelist  at  the end of a viewing session.\n            This is best used to store  the  results  of  complex\n            sorts  (-Spixels for example) for later viewing.  Any\n            changes to the internal filelist (such as deleting  a\n            file or it being pruned for being unloadable) will be\n            saved to FILE when feh exits. You can  add  files  to\n            filelists  by specifying them on the commandline when\n            also specifying the list.\n\t* I quite like this option. The reason I added was that I've been\n\ttesting some boundary conditions by recursing through complex\n\tdirectory trees / sorting 10,000 images by pixel size etc, and\n\tthat can take a while. Now I can do it once, save the filelist,\n\tand refer to that in future. You can of course use it to organise\n\tand group pics too. ~/lists/britney.list, ~/lists/laetitia.list.\n\tHmmmmmm.\n\nSun Apr 30 02:40:01 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* PageUp/PageDown in slideshows will jump back/forward about\n\t1/20th of the total number of files...\n\nSat Apr 29 21:42:45 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hrm. Actually wait for X to resize the window before rendering\n\tthe pixmap, or the resize sometimes gets delayed...\n\nSat Apr 29 04:52:20 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Heh. Sanely handle deleting the only/last image in the\n\tslideshow.\n\nThu Apr 27 16:10:35 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* You can delete files using ctrl-del in multiwindow mode too now.\n\t* Smoothing now occurs as soon as you stop zooming. This also\n\tmassively tidied the event loop and killed a couple of nasty\n\tglobals.\n\nThu Apr 27 14:39:44 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Spilt off the part of main_loop which loops for ever from the\n\tpart that responds to events. I now have a feh_main_iteration that\n\tprocesses events and returns afterwards. This means I can process\n\tevents from outside the main loop. I'm gonna use this and the\n\tnew interruptable progressive loaders to do funky stuff soon ;-)\n\nThu Apr 27 03:29:33 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Progressive loading api change.\n\nTue Apr 25 01:41:52 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* I'm bored, and a little drunk, so I made it pass -pedantic, for\n\tkicks.\n\nMon Apr 24 22:29:52 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Make sure nothing's cached.\n\nMon Apr 24 19:53:23 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Changed some of the debugging macros.\n\t* Found and fixed wasted extra loops in option file parsing.\n\nMon Apr 24 16:48:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Feh is hereby rereleased under a less restrictive license. Much\n\tas I want to propagate Free software, I don't want to be a Free\n\tsoftware Nazi. Do with it what you wish.\n\t* Various fixups, tweaks, and readability improvements.\n\nMon Apr 24 04:47:44 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Finally got off my arse and made the text center under the\n\timages in index mode.\n\nMon Apr 24 04:21:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Now that I have the config file, feh can safely be called\n\twithout any paramters, they can all be defined in the theme.\n\tThis leaves my:\n\tif(argc < 2) show_usage();\n\tlooking pretty stupid.\n\nMon Apr 24 03:53:16 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added --fontpath, to allow an extra directory to be specified in\n\twhich to look for fonts. You can add this to /etc/fehrc or\n\t~/.fehrc to make it permanent. Something like:\n\tfeh --fontpath /usr/share/ttfonts\n\nSat Apr 22 01:48:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* A slideshow delay of zero is now permitted. It means \"go as fast\n\tas you can\". I like it ;-) You can pause with the middle mouse\n\tbutton.\n\nWed Apr 19 19:42:45 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added -g, --collage. Collage mode is like montage mode, except\n\tthe image thumbnails are distributed randomly. Run test26 for an\n\texample.\n\nTue Apr 11 18:20:21 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Make included getopt actually work if needed :)\n\nSat Mar 25 17:42:43 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Event loop and zooming tweak.\n\nSat Mar 25 02:09:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay, well, seeing as feh isn't resize-friendly (it's just not\n\tdesigned for it - use gimp for that stuff ;), I'm disabling\n\tresizing of the window. Bite me :)\n\nFri Mar 24 19:22:51 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Muhahaha. Config file. It had to be done, there are so many\n\toptions now. This is totally optional of course, if you don't\n\tcreate one, you'll never notice the difference. Here's how it\n\tworks...\n\t* If ~/.fehrc exists, or if not, but /etc/fehrc exists, feh will\n\tlook in it for name/options pairs. An example entry would be:\n\timagemap -rVq --thumb-width 40 --thumb-height 30\n\t* You can use the theme in two ways. Either\n\tfeh -C themename [images]\n\tor you can create a symbolic link to feh with the name of the\n\toptions you want it to use. So from the example above:\n\tln -s `which feh` ~/bin/imagemap\n\tNow I just run 'imagemap' to use those options.\n\tA cooler example is\n\tmkindex -iO index.jpg --title-font 20thcent/24 .\n        Notice the '.' at the end.\n\tNow with a symlink I can create a mkindex command which will\n\tcreate an index.jpg in the current directory. I just run:\n\t$ mkindex.\n\t* An example.fehrc is provided with a couple of cool examples.\n\nFri Mar 24 19:17:27 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Slightly increased the default index mode font size.\n\nFri Mar 24 16:59:28 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Modified index mode to only show the image name below each\n\tthumbnail, and added -I, --fullindex mode to provide the other\n\tinfo (size, dimensions). Squashed a bug where the index print was\n\talways made 30 pixels too tall ;)\n\nThu Mar 23 22:45:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Feh will now read options from the environment variable\n\tFEH_OPTIONS if it is set. These options will be loaded before\n\tcommandline ones, and so can be overidden. The syntax is the same\n\tas the commandline, so multiples are allowed (eg \"-Vq -Sname\")\n\tI would recommend export FEH_OPTIONS=\"-Vq\" as being quite handy.\n\nWed Mar 22 22:52:53 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Well, it might be an idea to tell wget to ignore server-cached\n\tdata when reloading webcams :)\n\tDOH!\n\nWed Mar 22 19:57:04 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Better man page. Examples of cool usage.\n\nWed Mar 22 18:17:11 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Man page! Whee!\n\nWed Mar 22 04:14:12 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added format specifiers for actions. %w width, %h height, %p\n\tpixels, %s size, %t type (jpeg etc).\n\nWed Mar 22 03:50:24 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* User definable actions for slideshow and multiwindow modes. Use\n\t-X or --action STRING to define an action. The action will be run\n\twhen the ENTER key is pressed. The action should be in the form of\n\ta shell command, using %f to represent the image filename\n\t(including path), and %n to refer to it's name. Example:\n\tfeh -X \"mv %f ~/images/%n\"\n\tUse this to go through some images and pick out the good ones :)\n\tMore format specifiers will follow...\n\nWed Mar 22 02:55:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay. I found a naughty bug of mine. If the last image of a\n\tmontage/index was not loadable - core was dumped. Nice bug. Fun to\n\tfind =) I blame redhat.\n\nTue Mar 21 15:45:02 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Major cruft removal and tidying of code path. Progressive\n\tloading code slightly less complex now.\n\nTue Mar 21 15:18:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Big optimisation for progressive loading in fullscreen mode. I\n\twas recreating the pixmap at every iteration - damnit ;)\n\nMon Mar 20 21:54:22 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Dammit. Why do I find these things *after* a release?\n\nMon Mar 20 19:24:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Released 0.7.0\n\nSun Mar 19 20:55:57 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Main event loop tidy up.\n\nSat Mar 18 21:59:55 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added a coupla more tests...\n\nSat Mar 18 21:56:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed stupid segfault using --list when there are no loadable\n\timages.\n\nSat Mar 18 14:06:08 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* --list tidy up.\n\nSat Mar 18 02:56:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* More --verbose twiddles.\n\nSat Mar 18 02:18:39 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Made the --verbose output more useful, and prettier ;)\n\nSat Mar 18 00:37:17 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Made the -V, --verbose option give cooler output on loading\n\tmulitple images. It's pretty flim now.\n\nSat Mar 18 00:32:42 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added -U, --loadables, and -u, --unloadables. They don't show\n\timages, just list all the files from the filelist that are\n\tloadable or unloadable, respectively.\n\nFri Mar 17 22:58:14 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Don't need to create checkerboard for list mode, montage mode,\n\tindex mode, etc...\n\nFri Mar 17 22:43:27 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* We don't need to allocate space for the file info unless we\n\tintend to use it. Saves RAM on big file lists...\n\nFri Mar 17 22:18:50 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Big changes. I am tired ;)\n\t* You can now sort the filelist in any mode.\n\t* Sorting by name/filename is *fast*\n\t* Sorting by image properties such as width, height, type etc\n\tincurs a delay at startup while the images are preloaded. This\n\tcould get big for large lists of files.\n\t* Added a -p, --preload option to force preloading before running\n\ta slideshow. This weeds out images that imlib2 can't load so that\n\tthe initial number of slides is accurate. Normally, the bad/non\n\timages are weeded out as you go, causing the number of slides to\n\tupdate as things go. Preload is great for montage and index modes,\n\tas it ensures the correctly sized space is allocated for the\n\timages/thumbnails/whatever.\n\nFri Mar 17 19:22:18 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* List modes can now sort by image info using -S, --sort. Allowed\n\tsort modes are width, height, pixels, size, format, name,\n\tfilename. Default sort mode is none (ie order specified/read).\n\t* eg. feh -lSpixels * to see the highest resolution images...\n\nFri Mar 17 18:04:03 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added -L, --longlist to allow for more detailed listings. Lists\n\tare sorted by filename now too. (Until I write more sorting\n\toptions...)\n\nThu Mar 16 19:47:16 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Slightly cleaner --list stuff...\n\nThu Mar 16 17:46:39 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added -l, --list mode. Doesn't display images, just analyses\n\tthem a little and spits out an 'ls' style listing with some basic\n\tinfo. Useful in scripts. I intend to extend this somewhat soon.\n\nThu Mar 16 16:40:19 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added -q, --quiet option. Stops non-fatal image load errors\n\tbeing reported. Useful when you want to do feh * on a directory\n\twith some images, some other stuff. You'll only see what imlib2\n\tcan load.\n\nWed Mar 15 21:32:48 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed bug using the short versions of --limit-width and\n\t--limit-height\n\nWed Mar 15 21:17:26 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Better still. Font size increases in fullscreen mode, but -d\n\tworks in windowed modes too now.\n\nWed Mar 15 20:58:50 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hrm. Much better.\n\nWed Mar 15 20:36:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added -d, --draw_filename for use with fullscreen mode. It\n\tsticks the filename up in the top left. Needs some more work yet.\n\nSat Mar 11 23:35:20 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added proper commandline option parsing courtesy of getopt_long\n\t:) Obviously not everyone has this, so I include it myself. Now\n\tyou can combine args in nice ways: \"feh -kR20 http://some.webcam\"\n\t* It passes \"make test\" okay, but I reserve the right to have\n\tbroken something =) Let me know?\n\nSat Mar 11 01:34:36 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* 0.6.4 released\n\nTue Mar  7 23:07:40 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed evil segv due to uninitialised gc.\n\nSat Mar  4 16:33:29 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* --help output for the new options.\n\t* Added --booth, with is a shortcut for a fullscreen slideshow\n\twith an auto-change every 20 seconds...\n\nSat Mar  4 15:59:44 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Bah. Disabled zooming in fullscreen mode for now. I'll do the\n\tmath and fix it later.\n\t* I think I'm gonna have to rewrite shedloads of it to support\n\twindow resizing etc...\n\nSat Mar  4 14:46:42 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed progressive loading in fullscreen mode. Those callbacks\n\t*are* on crack, but for them to make sense would be a big rewrite\n\tI don't have time for now =)\n\t* Unfortunately, zooming in fullscreen mode is broken, I'm looking\n\tat this now. Also, I get a weird segv when I do \"feh -F directory\"\n\tbut not when I do \"feh -F file\" or \"feh -F file1 file2\", and not\n\twhen I do \"feh directory\" or \"feh -b directory\" etc. I'm trying to\n\twork this out, but the fullscreen thing should be independent of\n\tthe filelist thing...\n\nFri Mar  3 22:44:25 PST 2000  Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>\n\n\t* Added two new options.  --randomize will take the file list and\n\trearrange it into a random order.  --full-screen or -F will create\n\ta screen-sized borderless window (akin to a screensaver) and will\n\tcenter the image within it.  NOTE:  At this point, full screen mode\n\tonly works if you disable the progressive callback.  I'm waaaay too\n\ttired right now to try to make sense out of gilbertt's callback\n\tlogic. :-)  I'll try to fix it this weekend if he doesn't beat me\n\tto it.\n\nWed Mar  1 15:13:04 PST 2000  Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>\n\n\t* Math lib\n\nSun Feb 20 15:22:00 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Remove some crufty duplication.\n\nSat Feb 19 17:11:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Reduced mem usage, tuned file handling. Tidied up.\n\nSat Feb 19 00:55:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added -b, --borderless option. Can you guess what it does?\n\nFri Feb 18 23:51:14 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Well, if I wasn't so dumb, I'd have realised that my last\n\tcomment only holds true for depths > 4000 or so. I don't have that\n\there. So, s/massive/fscking enormous/g.\n\t* Fixed the *actual* problem, which was, of course, that I forgot\n\tto close my damn dirents.\n\t* Pull out the cl00bats, for I have goofed.\n\nFri Feb 18 23:33:54 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay, okay. I suck. There is a mild problem I have to fix when\n\trunning recursively on *massive* hierarchy's. Basically, I run out\n\tof file descriptors :( At least it now aborts when this happens, but\n\tI need to fix this.\n\nFri Feb 18 21:13:32 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* configure.in: less stupid\n\nFri Feb 18 20:51:53 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* index.c: misc tidyups\n\nFri Feb 18 20:41:02 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Misc fixes and cleanups.\n\nFri Feb 18 16:34:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Stupid, stupid, stupid. I am stupid.\n\nThu Feb 17 23:14:09 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Ooh. Cool. Now slideshow/deletion numbering works more sanely -\n\tthanks to the new filelist code.\n\nThu Feb 17 23:13:22 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hehe. That was more dumb than usual. Deleting files somewhat\n\tdestroyed the list, and caused nice segfaults.\n\nThu Feb 17 22:05:40 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* More file-list fixes.\n\nThu Feb 17 21:55:53 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Note to self: if you prepend everything to a list, the resultant\n\tlist will be in reverse. You'll be needing to fix that =)\n\nThu Feb 17 21:35:15 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Thank goodness for that :) I totally reworked the file handling\n\tcode, and things are cleaner internally now. The change shouldn't\n\tshow to a user, but for me, things are better.\n\t* I broke stuff badly with this change, and only now have I got\n\teverything back on track. There may be issues still, but it seems\n\tgood now, and I'll keep playing with it...\n\nWed Feb  9 21:59:09 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Removed all the image modification code from feh, seeing as\n\tdphase is working on ee2. No point duplicating everything :)\n\t* I figure feh can view pr0n, while ee2 modifies it :) Something\n\tlike that, anyway.\n\t* I never wanted the modification stuff in here really, it was\n\tjust feature creep. Feh is a viewer and montager. That is all :)\n\nTue Jan 11 21:11:11 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hrm. Just so you know what order they come in, the images are\n\t  now saved in /tmp (actually whatever tempdir is set up on your\n\t  system) in the format \"number\"_\"unique bit\"_\"original filename\"\n\nTue Jan 11 20:52:19 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay. The cached images are now deleted. The filenames are no\n\t  longer crap. (\"Unique prefix\"_feh_\"original filename\")\n\t* New option -k, --keep-http, tell feh *not* to delete the files,\n\t  so that you can later claim them from /tmp. Saves you\n\t  downloading them again if you like them.\n\t* A happy side effect of this is that if you use -k and -R to keep\n\t  http and reload, and point the thing at a webcam, you'll capture\n\t  each frame and save it as a separate image.\n\t* I *can't* imagine why anyone would *want* that, but I thought\n\t  I'd pass it on ;-)\n\nTue Jan 11 19:51:40 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Caching of images loaded via http. When in slideshow mode, and\n\t  the --reload option is not specified, a file loaded by http will\n\t  be stored in /tmp to avoid reloading from the web it every time\n\t  you loop through the slideshow or whatever.\n\t* The --reload option disables caching\n\t* Right now, the cached images are left in temp with crap\n\t  filenames. I'm gonna fix it up so that they are normally deleted\n\t  on program exit, but there will be an option to save them to the\n\t  current directory. (So you still have the images after viewing\n\t  them).\n\nTue Jan 11 19:07:07 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* New option, -R, --reload. Lets you specify a time in seconds,\n\t  feh will reload the image for you after this time. This works for\n\t  normal files and urls. The image will not be cached, so it is\n\t  ideal for viewing webcam images etc.\n\nMon Jan 10 22:48:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Whee. Now feh can load images from urls.\n\t* Specify an image starting with http:// and feh will use wget to\n\t  load the image, store it in a temporary file and view it.\n\t* You must have wget installed for this to work.\n\t* I have some optimisations to add, the image is currently not\n\t  cached, so if you have http files in a slideshow, they will reload\n\t  each time you get to them ;) I'll do this soon.\n\nSat Jan  8 18:44:05 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Finally got around to adding timers to feh. Now there is a new\n\t  option, -D, or --slideshow-delay NUM. NUM is the time in seconds\n\t  between changing slides for you. There is a new test to\n\t  demonstrate this option.\n\t* The timer will pause while you zoom, and will be reset if you\n\t  change slides yourself.\n\t* The timers code is loosely based on raster's epplet timer\n\t  code, 'cos its cool. No need to re-invent the wheel ;)\n\nMon Jan  3 18:29:46 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay. feh is now capable of some minor touch-ups. Nothing major,\n\tand no image saving yet, but it tests the selection and\n\tmodification code.\n\t* We're not writing a full-blown editor here... The idea is to\n\tbrowse through your images, select one, make minor changes if you\n\twant, then set it as your desktop background.\n\t* To test, toggle the various modes and use the left mouse button\n\tto use 'em.\n\t* 'c' - crop image to rectangle\n\t* 'o' - increase contrast of rectangle\n\t* 'b' - increase brightness of rectangle\n\t* 'g' - increase gamma of rectangle\n\t* 'Escape' - exit modification mode.\n\t* I'll leave the rest of the modification stuff to Andrew ;-) I\n\tguess maybe we should have some persistant rectangle selections,\n\tbut I don't want to go too far.\n\nSat Jan  1 22:25:49 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* I prefer LineOnOffDash drawing more for selections :)\n\nSat Jan  1 22:12:37 2000  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* I'm alive!!! Somewhat hungover though ;)\n\t* So, some changes to the rectangle selection code, some by\n\tAndrew, some by me :) Again, press 'r' to test it.\n\nSun Dec 26 22:57:53 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Take the gc creation out of the loop, as much as poss.\n\t* Is xmas over now?\n\t* Am I still drunk?\n\nFri Dec 24 13:22:19 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* I've switched to using XFindContext et al to associate X Windows\n\twith internal structures. Much faster than my rubbish list\n\tsearching.\n\t* Dammit. Why don't people tell me you can *do* stuff like this ;)\n\nFri Dec 24 01:01:49 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* And now we can crop :) Thanks Andrew.\n\nThu Dec 23 20:45:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* We can now draw selection rectangles on windows using XORed\n\tlines. This rules. Once the editing functions and menus are in\n\tplace, we'll use them to do stuff :)\n\t* For now, press r to toggle line drawing, so you can see it for\n\tyourself. Click and drag lmb to see.\n\nWed Dec 22 23:37:27 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* More stuff from Andrew (hoss), we're starting to add stuff for\n\tdrawing rectangles, applying mods to rectangles, setting\n\tbackgrounds (under any wm) and other stuff like that.\n\nWed Dec 22 21:49:10 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Memory usage down by ONE THIRD :)\n\t* I finally did the checkerboard bg thing the Right Way, and saved\n\tlots of wasted RAM. Hooray.\n\nWed Dec 22 20:47:11 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* And now index mode has a go at recommending the image size for\n\tyou, if you specify one too small.\n\nWed Dec 22 18:23:42 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hehe. Found it. Little bugger. *squish*\n\nWed Dec 22 18:12:43 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* More modify.c submissions from Andrew, including the start of\n\tsome very funky background setting and image scaling ::)\n\t* A total rewrite of the index generating code to take into\n\taccount the font size and string length. The old version was\n\tpretty unflim, so its nice to clean it up a bit. However, the niew\n\tcode still has a couple of issues, which I am looking into.\n\nWed Dec 22 13:21:12 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay, index mode now kinda takes into account the height of the\n\tfont you use. Width is on its way, but is more tricky.\n\nWed Dec 22 02:17:01 1999  Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>\n\n\t* Removed a warning, and added \"make testclean\"\n\nTue Dec 21 23:28:20 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* More modify.c submissions from Andrew, and some initial menu\n\twork. The menus are not compiled in right now, and would core if I\n\tdid, so don't touch 'em for now :) They are only 5 mins work atm.\n\t* I have #ifdef'ed out the code which uses X86VidMode extensions\n\tuntil I can find out how common it is not to have them :)\n\nTue Dec 21 18:40:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* The winwidget_rerender_image() function now checks for changed\n\tdimensions and acts accordingly, and the rotate() function now\n\tupdates the width and height attributes. The modify.c functions\n\tare now available for testing using 1-9, 0, -, = key presses.\n\nTue Dec 21 18:01:15 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Encorporated modify.c, contributed by Andrew Glover\n\t<aglover@axe.net>. These functions wrap imlib2 modification\n\tfunctions, and will be handy when I make some menus :) We'll be\n\table to do scaling, tiling, color modifiers, and more.\n\nTue Dec 21 03:28:30 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* And now the thing won't go mad when you hold down a change-slide\n\tbutton in Slideshow mode... Before it stored *all* the KeyPresses\n\tand responded to *all* of them. Hehe. It was fun watching it go\n\tround though :)\n\nMon Dec 20 17:35:25 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hehe. Ooops. I only need to blend on zoom if the image *has* an\n\talpha channel. Hehe. Ok, now zooming is *much* faster and\n\tsmoother, and I am slightly less of an idiot.\n\nMon Dec 20 16:46:58 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay, I'm still a newbie at this X stuff :) Made some\n\toptimisations to the main loop which speed things up a\n\tbunch.\n\t* Added better error handling when loading images.\n\t* The Q or q key can now be used to exit the app in any mode.\n\nMon Dec 20 15:22:43 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added some utility functions, so I don't have to write\n\tif((s=malloc(blah))==NULL){fprintf(\"oops\\n\");exit(2);}\n\t15 million times. It really bugs me ;-)\n\nMon Dec 20 12:53:28 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Hehe. I like slideshow mode so much its now the default :)\n\tHaving multiple images pop up one-per-window can be quite evil, so\n\tSlideshow mode is prefered. To open multiple images\n\tone-per-window, you now need to specify -w or -multiwindow.\n\t* I also fixed a couple of things, lowered slideshow overhead,\n\ttightened up the main loop somewhat, and a coupla things really\n\tlate last night which I can't remember ;-)\n\nSun Dec 19 22:06:43 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* For packaging reasons, I have changed the scripts to run feh in\n\tthe current dir, if it is there, but to fall back on the installed\n\tcopy.\n\nSun Dec 19 20:29:33 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added a .spec file for feh. Contributed by Alistair Sutton\n\t<metallica@freenet.co.uk>, (who is obviously a metallica fan ;),\n\tand has written specs for me before ::) Thanks dude :)\n\t* Urm. I haven't actually tested this yet :)\n\nSun Dec 19 18:55:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Slideshow mode now has keyboard control ::)\n\tMouse button 1 still changes slides, but you now have:\n\tp, P, <BACKSPACE>, <LEFT>  Goto previous slide\n\tn, N, <SPACE>, <RIGHT>     Goto next slide\n\t<HOME>                     Goto first slide\n\t<END>                      Goto last slide\n\t<DELETE>                   Delete the file currently being viewed\n\tq, Q                       Quit the slideshow\n\n\tMore to come.\n\nSun Dec 19 15:43:07 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Big performance improvements in the main loop. Squashed another\n\tcouple of bugs, and made things real stable. Tightened up the\n\ttests somewhat, and split the source up more clearly.\n\nSun Dec 19 02:58:35 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Fixed a number of bugs introduced by the new progressive loading\n\tand zooming code ::)\n\nSat Dec 18 22:11:02 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Whee. Progressive loading works :) It can be disabled with -P,\n\t--noprogressive, if you don't want it. Can't think why though. It\n\trocks. Thanks again go to Raster. Progressive loading callbacks\n\t*rule*.\n\nSat Dec 18 18:15:18 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* The fonts are now installed, and loaded from the installation\n\tdirectory.\n\nSat Dec 18 15:45:39 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Okay then, there is now a checkerboard background when\n\tzooming out. There is a more memory efficent way of doing this,\n\tbut I'll do that later...\n\nSat Dec 18 14:31:58 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Wheeeee! Thanks to Raster's example code, we now have zooming\n\tRaster, you are my hero :)\n\tSo, middle-mouse button and drag -> zoom.\n\tThere are some things to tidy up (eg adding a background when\n\tzooming out), but these are trivial compared to getting the\n\tzooming working with multiple windows, which I just did ::)\n\nFri Dec 17 22:00:57 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added titles to index prints. A title will only be printed if\n\tyou specify --title-font.\n\nFri Dec 17 21:33:55 1999  Michael Jennings  <mej@eterm.org>\n\n\t* Added \"make test\" to run the test scripts one by one.\n\nFri Dec 17 21:32:16 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added more info the the index output :) Try test14 now :)\n\nFri Dec 17 21:01:21 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added a couple of fonts, found one small for doing index prints,\n\ttidied the directory structure a bit.\n\nFri Dec 17 18:37:14 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Added some new options, here's an excerpt from --help\n\t-S, --slideshow  Enable slideshow mode. With this setting, instead\n                         of opening multiple windows for multiple image\n                         files, one window will be opened. Press mouse\n                         button one to flick through the images.\n\t-i, --index      Enable Index mode. Index mode is similar to\n                         montage mode, and accepts the same options. It\n                         creates an index print of thumbails, printing user-\n                         defined information beneath each thumbnail. Index\n                         mode enables certain other options, see INDEX MODE\n                         OPTIONS\n\t-f FONT          Use FONT to print the information under each\n                         thumbnail. FONT should be defined in the form\n                         fontname/size(points). eg -f myfont/12\n\tNow all I need is a font which is legible in very small point :)\n\tI also added a couple of new tests for these options.\n\nFri Dec 17 03:09:46 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Made the test scripts more verbose. It appears that people who\n\trun a test called test07_bork_non_image_files still expect it to\n\twork ;) hehe.\n\nFri Dec 17 02:09:20 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Right-clicking in multi-image mode now closes ALL windows. I'll\n\tadd a popup menu soon.\n\nThu Dec 16 22:58:21 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Changed --help output to fit into 80 characters...\n\nThu Dec 16 22:10:50 1999  Tom Gilbert  <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>\n\n\t* Initial import. Feh is currently at 0.5.0 release level.\n"

          "content": "# feh - Image Viewer and Cataloguer\n\n**feh** is a light-weight, configurable and versatile image viewer.\nIt is aimed at command line users, but can also be started from graphical file\nmanagers. Apart from viewing images, it can compile text and thumbnail\nlistings, show (un)loadable files, set X11 backgrounds, and more.\n\nFeatures include filelists, various image sorting modes, custom action scripts,\nand image captions. feh can be controlled by configurable keyboard and mouse\nshortcuts, terminal input and signals.  When no file arguments or filelists are\nspecified, feh displays all files in the current directory.\n\nThis README focuses on installation and contribution instructions.  See the\n[feh homepage](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) and the\n[feh(1) manual](https://man.finalrewind.org/1/feh/) for usage instructions.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n * Imlib2\n * libcurl (disable with `curl=0`)\n * libpng\n * libX11\n * libXt\n * libXinerama (disable with `xinerama=0`)\n\nOnly when building with `exif=1`:\n\n * libexif-dev\n * libexif12\n\nOnly when building with `magic=1`:\n\n * libmagic\n\n## Build Process\n\nfeh has been packaged for a variety of distributions, including\n[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/feh/),\n[Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=feh&exact=1),\n[FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/graphics/feh), and\n[Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=feh&exact=1).\nYou can configure, compile and install a custom version as follows.\n\n### Configuration\n\nfeh's build process uses make flags to enable/disable optional features and\nfine-tune the build and installation process. It uses (hopefully) reasonable\ndefaults, so you can skip this section if you like.\n\nMake flags can be passed as **make** arguments or set as environment variables,\nlike so:\n\n```bash\n$ make flag=bool\n$ make install flag=bool\n```\nor\n```bash\n$ export flag=bool\n$ make && make install\n```\n\nThe following flags are respected by the makefile. A default value of **1**\nindicates that the corresponding feature is enabled by default.\n\n| Flag | Default value | Description |\n| :--- | :---: | :--- |\n| app  | 0 | install icons to /usr/share, regardless of `DESTDIR` and `PREFIX`, and call gtk-update-icon-cache afterwards |\n| curl | 1 | use libcurl to view https:// and similar images |\n| debug | 0 | debug build, enables `--debug` |\n| exif | 0 | Builtin EXIF tag display support |\n| help | 0 | include help text (refers to the manpage otherwise) |\n| inotify | 0 | enable inotify, needed for `--auto-reload` |\n| stat64 | 0 | Support CIFS shares from 64bit hosts on 32bit machines |\n| magic | 0 | Use libmagic to filter unsupported file formats |\n| mkstemps | 1 | Whether your libc provides `mkstemps()`. If set to 0, feh will be unable to load gif images via libcurl |\n| verscmp | 1 | Whether your libc provides `strvercmp()`. If set to 0, feh will use an internal implementation. |\n| xinerama | 1 | Support Xinerama/XRandR multiscreen setups |\n\nFor example, `make xinerama=0 debug=1` will disable Xinerama support and\nproduce a debug build; libcurl and natural sorting support will remain enabled.\n\nAdditionally, it supports the standard variables `CFLAGS`, `LDLIBS`, `PREFIX`,\nand `DESTDIR`.\n\n**PREFIX _(default: /usr/local)_** controls where the application and its data files\nwill be installed. It must be set both during `make` and `make install`.\n\n**DESTDIR _(default: empty)_** sets the installation root during \"make install\". It\nis mostly useful for package maintainers.\n\n**Note:** Defaults are specified in `config.mk`. It is designed so that in most\ncases, you can set environment variables instead of editing it. E.g.:\n\n```bash\n$ CFLAGS='-g -Os' make\n```\n```bash\n$ export DESTDIR=/tmp/feh PREFIX=/usr\n$ make && make install\n```\n\nBuiltin EXIF support is maintained by Dennis Real, [here](https://github.com/reald/feh).\n\n### Installation\n\nAdd your own make flags to the following examples as needed.\n\n**For end users:**\n```bash\n$ make\n$ sudo make install app=1\n```\n\n**For package maintainers and users who do not want feh to install its\nicons into /usr/share:**\n```bash\n$ make\n$ sudo make install\n```\n\n**Explanation:** feh ships some icons and an X11 desktop entry, which allow it to\nbe used from file managers, desktop menus and similar. However, installing\nicons to /usr/local/share/... does not seem to work reliably.\nBecause of this, when using \"make install app=1\", feh will install its icons\nto /usr/share/..., even though they technically belong into /usr/local.\n\n[ZSH completion for\nfeh](https://git.finalrewind.org/zsh/plain/etc/completions/_feh) is also\navailable.\n\n## Testing (non-X11)\n\nThe non-X11 parts of feh can be automatically tested by running\n\n```bash\n$ make test\n```\nThis requires **perl >= 5.10** and the perl module `Test::Command`. Tests are\nnon-interactive and do not require a running X11, so they can safely be run on\na headless buildserver.\n\n## Contributing\n\nBugfixes are always welcome, just open a pull request :)\n\nBefore proposing a new feature, please consider the scope of feh: It is an\nimage viewer and cataloguer, not an image editor or similar. Also, its option\nlist is already pretty long. Please discuss your ideas in a feature request\nbefore opening a pull request in this case. Also, keep in mind that feh is\ndeveloped as a hobby project and that there is absolutely no obligation for\nanyone to implement requested features or review merge requests.\n\nPlease keep in mind that feh's options, key bindings and format specifiers are\ndocumented in two different places: The manual (man/feh.pre) and the help text\n(src/help.raw). Although the help is not compiled in by default, it should be\nkept up-to-date. On space-constrained embedded systems, it may be more useful\nthan the (significantly larger) man page.\n"
