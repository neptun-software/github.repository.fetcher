It is also designed to be easy to port to new platforms\nif your platform is not already supported.\n\n## License\n\nNNG is licensed under a liberal, and commercial friendly, MIT license.\nThe goal to the license is to minimize friction in adoption, use, and\ncontribution.\n\n## Enhancements (Relative to nanomsg)\n\nHere are areas where this project improves on \"nanomsg\":\n\n- _Reliability_\n\n  NNG is designed for production use from the beginning.\n  Every error case is considered, and it is designed to avoid crashing except\n  in cases of gross developer error.\n  (Hopefully we don't have any of these in our own code.)\n\n- _Scalability_\n\n  NNG scales out to engage multiple cores using a bespoke asynchronous I/O\n  framework, using thread pools to spread load without exceeding typical\n  system limits.\n\n- _Maintainability_\n\n  NNG's architecture is designed to be modular and easily grasped by developers\n  unfamiliar with the code base. The code is also well documented.\n\n- _Extensibility_\n\n  Because it avoids ties to file descriptors, and avoids confusing interlocking\n  state machines, it is easier to add new protocols and transports to NNG.\n  This was demonstrated by the addition of the TLS and ZeroTier transports.\n\n- _Security_\n\n  NNG provides TLS (1.2 and optionally 1.3) and ZeroTier transports, offering\n  support for robust and industry standard authentication and encryption.\n  In addition, it is hardened to be resilient against malicious attackers,\n  with special consideration given to use in a hostile Internet.\n\n- _Usability_\n\n  NNG eschews slavish adherence parts of the more complex and less well\n  understood POSIX APIs, while adopting the semantics that are familiar and\n  useful. New APIs are intuitive, and the optional support for separating\n  protocol context and state from sockets makes creating concurrent\n  applications vastly simpler than previously possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis project offers both wire compatibility and API compatibility,\nso most nanomsg users can begin using NNG right away.\n\nExisting nanomsg and [mangos](https://github.com/nanomsg/mangos) applications\ncan inter-operate with NNG applications automatically.\n\nThat said, there are some areas where legacy nanomsg still offers\ncapabilities NNG lacks -- specifically enhanced observability with\nstatistics, and tunable prioritization of different destinations\nare missing, but will be added in a future release.\n\nAdditionally, some API capabilities that are useful for foreign\nlanguage bindings are not implemented yet.\n\nSome simple single threaded, synchronous applications may perform better under\nlegacy nanomsg than under NNG. (We believe that these applications are the\nleast commonly deployed, and least interesting from a performance perspective.\nNNG's internal design is slightly less efficient in such scenarios, but it\ngreatly benefits when concurrency or when multiple sockets or network peers\nare involved.)\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nNNG supports Linux, macOS, Windows, illumos, Solaris,\nFreeBSD, Android, and iOS.\nIt is regularly tested against macOS, Windows, OmniOS, Ubuntu, and FreeBSD.\nMost other POSIX platforms should work out of\nthe box but have not been tested. Very old versions of otherwise supported\nplatforms might not work.\n\nOfficially, NNG only supports operating systems that are supported by\ntheir vendors. For example, Windows versions 8.1 and lower are no longer\nofficially supported, and macOS versions predating Ventura are no longer\nofficially supported. Very old versions of systems may or may not work,\nand we will generally expend no effort trying to make an unsupported system\nfunction.\nWe generally only test relatively recent versions of supported systems.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo build this project, you will need a C11 compatible compiler and\n[CMake](http://www.cmake.org) version 3.15 or newer.\n\nWe recommend using the [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) build\nsystem (pass `-G Ninja` to CMake) when you can.\n(And not just because Ninja sounds like \"NNG\" -- it's also\nblindingly fast and has made our lives as developers measurably better.)\n\nIf you want to build with TLS support you will also need\n[Mbed TLS](https://tls.mbed.org) or [WolfSSL](https://wolfssl.com).\nSee the [build instructions](docs/BUILD_TLS.md) for details.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nWith a Linux or UNIX environment:\n\n```sh\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ cmake -G Ninja ..\n$ ninja\n$ ninja test\n$ ninja install\n```\n\n## Reference Manual\n\nThe API documentation is currently in transition, as we are converting it from\nAsciidoc to `mdbook`. Most of the content has now been converted, and you can\nsee it at [here](https://nng.nanomsg.org/ref). Part of the conversion includes\na substantial reorganization for improved usability, with major content revisions\nand additions for NNG 2.0.\n\nThe remaining Asciidoc format documentation is in the `docs/man` subdirectory, and also\n[online](https://nng.nanomsg.org/man). It will eventually all be converted before 2.0\nis fully released.\n\nYou can also purchase a copy of the\n[**NNG Reference Manual**](http://staysail.tech/books/nng_reference/index.html).\n(It is published in both electronic and printed formats.)\nPurchases of the book help fund continued development of NNG.\n\n## Example Programs\n\nSome demonstration programs have been created to help serve as examples.\nThese are located in the `demo` directory.\n\n## Legacy Compatibility\n\nMigration from `libnanomsg` APIs is fairly straight-forward for most applications.\nA [migration guide](docs/ref/migrate/nanomsg.md) is available to assist.\n\n## Commercial Support\n\nCommercial support for NNG is available.\n\nPlease contact\n[Staysail Systems, Inc.](mailto:info@staysail.tech)\nto inquire further.\n\n## Commercial Sponsors\n\nThe development of NNG has been made possible through the generous\nsponsorship of\n[Capitar IT Group BV](https://www.capitar.com)\nand\n[Staysail Systems, Inc.](http://staysail.tech).\n"

          "content": "# Ukraine, Russia, and a World Tragedy\n\n## Updated message for October 6, 2024\n\nОстановите безумие. Закончить войну. Верни ребят домой.\n\nTwo and a half years on, the war in Europe continues, at great cost to the peoples of both\nUkraine and Russia. Hundreds of thousands of casualities, perhaps even millions, on both\nsides of the conflict, for two peoples that quite recently considered themselves as brothers and sisters.\n\nHow to make it stop? The solution to this problem is simple.\n\nAs the aggressor, Russia must merely recall its forces from Ukraine, and end its\ninvasion, returning to the borders as they were drawn over 30 years ago. It must give\nup its imperial ambitions.\n\nUkraine must of course recall its forces from Russia as well.\n\nAnd both sides must commit to a ceasation of hostilities.\n\nIt is not reasonable to expect Ukraine to do so first or unilaterally, while Russian forces\noccupy some 20% of its territory. Russia is the clear aggressor here, for reasons that defy\nexplanation. The original goals (\"denazification\") were themselves laughable, particularly given\nthat many of the invading Russian forces were self-styled neo-nazis.\n\nAnd now? To fight NATO?\nTo fight the USA? To what end?\n\nOnly Russia can make this war end, and if the current Russian leaership is unwilling to\ndo so, then it is up to the Russian people -- the mothers and fathers and wives and\nsiblings of those who are losing life and limb fighting a war that makes no sense to anyone\n-- to resolve the matter in other ways.\n\nOr shall the Russian people continue to led by a madman who so clearly perceives\nhimself as a 21st century reincarnation of Stalin (whether he publicly admits so or not?)\n\n- Garrett D'Amore\n\nMy original message, from over two years ago, is retained below.\n\n## A message to those inside Russia\n\n### Written March 4, 2022.\n\nIt is with a very heavy heart that I write this. I am normally opposed to the use of open source\nprojects to communicate political positions or advocate for things outside the immediate relevancy\nto that project.\n\nHowever, the events occurring in Ukraine, and specifically the unprecedented invasion of Ukraine by\nRussian forces operating under orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin compel me to speak out.\n\nThose who know me, know that I have family, friends, and colleagues in Russia, and Ukraine both. My closest friends\nhave historically been Russian friends my wife's hometown of Chelyabinsk. I myself have in the past\nfrequently traveled to Russia, and indeed operated a software development firm with offices in St. Petersburg.\nI had a special kinship with Russia and its people.\n\nI say \"had\", because I fear that the actions of Putin, and the massive disinformation campaign that his regime\nhas waged inside Russia, mean that it's likely that I won't see those friends again. At present, I'm not sure\nmy wife will see her own mother again. We no longer feel it's safe for either of us to return Russia given\nactions taken by the regime to crack down on those who express disagreement.\n\nRussian citizens are being led to believe it is acting purely defensively, and that only legitimate military\ntargets are being targeted, and that all the information we have received in the West are fakes.\n\nI am confident that nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThis has caused many in Russia, including people whom I respect and believe to be smarter than this, to\nstand by Putin, and endorse his actions. The claim is that the entirety of NATO is operating at the behest\nof the USA, and that the entirety of Europe was poised to attack Russia. While this is clearly absurd to those\nof us with any understanding of western politics, Russian citizens are being fed this lie, and believing it.\n\nIf you're reading this from inside Russia -- YOU are the person that I hope this message reaches. Your\ngovernment is LYING to you. Of course, all governments lie all the time. But consider this. Almost the\nentire world has condemned the invasion of Ukraine as criminal, and has applied sanctions. Even countries\nwhich have poor relations with the US sanctioning Russia, as well as nations which historically have remained\nneutral. (Famously neutral -- even during World War II, Switzerland has acted to apply sanctions in\nconcert with the rest of the world.)\n\nAsk yourself, why does Putin fear a free press so much, if what he says is true? Why the crack-downs on\nchildren expressing only a desire for peace with Ukraine? Why would the entire world unified against him,\nif Putin was in the right? Why would the only countries that stood with Russia against\nthe UN resolution to condemn these acts as crimes be Belarus, North Korea, and Syria? Even countries normally\nallied to Russia could not bring themselves to do more than abstain from the vote to condemn it.\n\nTo be clear, I do not claim that the actions taken by the West or by the Ukrainian government were completely\nblameless. On the contrary, I understand that Western media is biased, and the truth is rarely exactly\nas reported. I believe that there is a kernel of truth in the claims of fascists and ultra-nationalist\nmilitias operating in Ukraine and specifically Donbas. However, I am also equally certain that Putin's\nresponse is out of proportion, and that concerns about such militias are principally just a pretext to justify\nan invasion.\n\nEurope is at war, unlike we've seen in my lifetime. The world is more divided, and closer to nuclear holocaust\nthan it has been since the Cold War. And that is 100% the fault of Putin.\n\nWhile Putin remains in power, there cannot really be any way for Russian international relations to return\nto normal. Putin has set your country on a path to return to the Cold War, likely because he fancies himself\nto be a new Stalin. However, unlike the Soviet Union, the Russian economy does not have the wherewithal to\nstand on its own, and the invasion of Ukraine has fully ensured that Russia will not find any friends anywhere\nelse in Europe, and probably few places in Asia.\n\nThe _only_ paths forward for Russia are either a Russia without Putin (and those who would support his agenda),\nor a complete breakdown of Russian prosperity, likely followed by the increasing international conflict that will\nbe the natural escalation from a country that is isolated and impoverished. Those of us observing from the West are\ngravely concerned, because we cannot see any end to this madness that does not result in nuclear conflict,\nunless from within.\n\nIn the meantime, the worst prices will be paid for by innocents in Ukraine, and by young Russian men\nforced to carry out the orders of Putin's corrupt regime.\n\nAnd _that_ is why I write this -- to appeal to those within Russia to open your eyes, and think with\nyour minds. It is right and proper to be proud of your country and its rich heritage. But it is also\nright and proper to look for ways to save it from the ruinous path that its current leadership has set it upon,\nand to recognize when that leadership is no longer acting in interest of the country or its people.\n\n- Garrett D'Amore, March 4, 2022\n\n### Updates on March 16, 2024:\n\nI've made some minor typographical fixes.\n\nIt is extremely distressing to see that two years on, the\npeople of both Ukraine and Russia continue to suffer under this needless, pointless, conflict fought solely to assuage\nthe ego of a dictator.\n\nThe actions done here, have killed thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of soldiers and civilians alike, and there seems to be no end to the madness. I still pray for sanity to return, because the current path, if followed\nto its logical conclusion, most likely ends in apocalpyse.\n\nIf you find my sharing these truths uncomfortable, please feel welcome to cease use of my software. While the license does permit use by anyone for any reason, I would not be displeased if the Russian military, and those sympathetic to it, declined from use of any of my work.\n"
