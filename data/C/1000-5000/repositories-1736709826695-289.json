Thank you for your interest in contributing to Apache NuttX RTOS :-)\n\n## Guidelines\n\nTo help us successfully review your contribution, it is very\nimportant that you follow these guidelines.\n\nIf you need more information please read the [Full Contributing Documentation](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/index.html).\n\n### Coding Standard\n\n* You should follow [NuttX C Coding Standard](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/coding_style.html).\n\n* Your code will be automatically checked by GitHub Continuous Integration\n  (CI) system. If you see the \"check\" step fails, it is possible that this\n  happens due to style errors.\n\n* Note that we require you to solve these issues and adapt all modified files\n  even if you didn't introduce the problem yourself (this way,\n  every contribution gets us closer to compliance).\n\n\n### Commits\n\n* Each commit **must** contain a meaningful **commit message** that consist of:\n  * **topic** (mandatory).\n  * **description** (optional, separate with blank line from topic).\n\n* **Prefix** commit topic with a functional context\n  (i.e.  `sched: Fixed compiler warning.`).\n\n* Provide only **signed commits** (`git commit -s`) with valid author\n  and email fields.\n\n* Valid commit message example:\n\n    ```\n    net/can: Add g_ prefix to can_dlc_to_len and len_to_can_dlc.\n\n    Add g_ prefix to can_dlc_to_len and len_to_can_dlc to\n    follow NuttX coding style conventions for global symbols,\n    improving code readability and maintainability.\n    * you can also use bullet points.\n    * to note different thing briefly.\n\n    Signed-off-by: AuthorName <Valid@EmailAddress>\n    ```\n\n* If you create a proper commit message as explained above, the first line\n  will be automatically used as pull-request title and the rest is added as\n  description. Use it as a starting point to describe your Pull-Request (PR).\n\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n* Be sure to **fill in the pull-request report** with meaningful content.\n  Be very descriptive, take your time. Good explanation, as for someone who\n  can see the issue for the first time, will help understand the change and\n  improve the assessment process. Please provide short descriptions even for\n  a trivial change.\n\n  * **Summary:** It is important to provide information on why change is\n    necessary, what it exactly does and how, if new feature shows up,\n    provide references (dependencies, similar problems and solutions), etc.\n\n  * **Impact:** State how (where applicable) that change affects users, build\n    process, hardware, documentation, security, compatibility, etc.\n\n  * **Testing:** Please provide details on how did you verify the change,\n    what Host was used for build (OS, CPU, compiler, ..), what Target was\n    used for verification (arch, board:config, ..), etc.\n    Providing build and runtime logs from before and after change is highly\n    appreciated.\n\n* Introduce only one functional change per pull-request.\n\n* Provide finished and verified solutions.\n  Clearly mark Work-In-Progress pull requests not yet ready for assessment.\n\n\n## References\n\n### Example Pull Request Report\n\n#### Summary\n\n  * Why change is necessary (fix, update, new feature)?\n  * What functional part of the code is being changed?\n  * How does the change exactly work (what will change and how)?\n  * Related [NuttX Issue](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/issues) reference if applicable.\n  * Related NuttX Apps [Issue](https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps/issues) / [Pull Request](https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps/pulls) reference if applicable.\n\n#### Impact\n\n  * Is new feature added? Is existing feature changed?\n  * Impact on user (will user need to adapt to change)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).\n  * Impact on build (will build process change)? NO / YES (please descibe if yes).\n  * Impact on hardware (will arch(s) / board(s) / driver(s) change)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).\n  * Impact on documentation (is update required / provided)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).\n  * Impact on security (any sort of implications)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).\n  * Impact on compatibility (backward/forward/interoperability)? NO / YES (please describe if yes).\n  * Anything else to consider?\n\n#### Testing\n\n  I confirm that changes are verified on local setup and works as intended:\n  * Build Host(s): OS (Linux,BSD,macOS,Windows,..), CPU(Intel,AMD,ARM), compiler(GCC,CLANG,version), etc.\n  * Target(s): arch(sim,RISC-V,ARM,..), board:config, etc.\n\n  Testing logs before change:\n\n  ```\n  runtime / build logs before change goes here\n  ```\n\n  Testing logs after change:\n\n  ```\n  runtime / build logs after change goes here\n  ```\n\n  How to repeat:\n    * you can also provide steps on how to reproduce problem and verify the change.\n\n#### PR verification\n\n  * [ ] This PR introduces only one functional change.\n  * [ ] I have updated all required description fields above.\n  * [ ] My PR adheres to Contributing [Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/nuttx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Documentation](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/index.html) (git commit title and message, coding standard, etc).\n  * [ ] My PR is still work in progress (not ready for review).\n  * [ ] My PR is ready for review and can be safely merged into a codebase.\n"

Special\n    support must be minimized.\n  - The portable interface must never be compromised only for the sake of\n    expediency.\n  - Expediency or even improved performance are not justifications for\n    violation of the strict POSIX interface.\n\n## Modular Architecture\n\n  - The internal modular architecture of the OS must be maintained.\n  - This means formalizing and documenting all internal interfaces (in the\n    porting guide), minimal use of global variables at the interface, and\n    only well defined functional interfaces.\n\n## Clear, Consistent, Standardized Coding Style\n\n  - Strict conformance to the NuttX coding style.  No \"revolutionary\"\n    changes to the coding standard (but perhaps some \"evolutionary\"\n    changes).\n  - Personal or organizational preference is not a justification for a\n    coding style change.\n  - Nothing can come into NuttX that does not follow the coding standard.\n  - Expediency is not a justification for violating the coding standard.\n\n  The NuttX coding standard can be found here:\n  https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/coding_style.html\n\n## Open and Unencumbered License\n\n  - Currently BSD 3-clause or compatible:  BSD 3-clause with constraints,\n    BSD 3 and 4 clause, MIT, public domain.\n  - Other unencumbered licenses such as Apache may be considered.\n    NuttX will never be licensed under a restrictive, \"Copyleft\" license.\n\n## All Users Matter\n\n  - All support must apply equally to all supported platforms.  At present\n    this includes Linux, Windows MSYS, Windows Cygwin, Windows Ubuntu,\n    Windows native, macOS, Solaris, and FreeBSD.  No tool/environment\n    solutions will be considered that limit the usage of NuttX on any of\n    the supported platforms.\n  - Inclusive rather than exclusive.\n  - Hobbyists are valued users of the OS including retro computing hobbyists\n    and DIY “Maker” hobbyists.\n  - Supported toolchains:  GCC, Clang, SDCC, ZiLOG ZDS-II (c89), IAR.\n    Others?\n  - No changes to build system should limit use of NuttX by any user.\n  - Simplifying things for one user does not justify excluding another user.\n  - We should seek to expand the NuttX user base, not to limit it for\n    reasons of preference or priority.\n  - We must resist the pull to make NuttX into a Linux-only, GCC-only, and\n    ARM-only solution.\n\n## NuttX Branding\n\n  - The official name of authentic NuttX will always be \"NuttX\".\n  - This name is trademarked and may not be used by other OSs or forks of\n    NuttX.\n\n## The Enemies\n\n### No Short Cuts\n\n  - Doing things the easy way instead of the correct way.\n  - Reducing effort at the expense of Quality, Portability, or\n    Consistency.\n  - Focus on the values of the organization, not the values of the Open\n    Source project.

All rights reserved.\n\n The logic in this file was developed by Gary S. Brown:\n\n   COPYRIGHT (C) 1986 Gary S. Brown.  You may use this program, or code or tables\n   extracted from it, as desired without restriction.\n\n First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The polynomial is:\n\n    X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0\n\n Note that we take it \"backwards\" and put the highest-order term in the lowest-order bit.\n The X^32 term is \"implied\"; the LSB is the X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown\n as \"+1\") results in the MSB being 1\n\n Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which is what we're using\n (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit chunks at a time) shifts bits into the\n lowest-order term.  In our implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why\n do we do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in order from\n highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit characters in order from LSB\n to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to\n high-byte; the UART sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit\n by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit shuffling on our\n part.  Reception works similarly\n\n The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes\n\n - The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so is shown later.  It\n   might not be obvious, but the feedback terms simply represent the results of eight\n   shift/xor operations for all combinations of data and CRC register values\n\n - The values must be right-shifted by eight bits by the updcrc logic; the shift must\n   be u_(bring in zeroes).  On some hardware you could probably optimize the shift in\n   assembler by using byte-swap instructions polynomial $edb88320\n\nlibs/libc/misc/lib_fnmatch.c\n===============================\n\n   Copyright 1995, 2000 by Jef Poskanzer <jef@mail.acme.com>.\n   All rights reserved.\n\n Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\n are met:\n\n 1.

Scalable from 8-bit to 64-bit\nmicrocontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are POSIX\nand ANSI standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOSs\n(such as VxWorks) are adopted for functionality not available under these\nstandards, or for functionality that is not appropriate for deeply-embedded\nenvironments (such as fork()).\n\nFor brevity, many parts of the documentation will refer to Apache NuttX as simply NuttX.\n\n## Getting Started\nFirst time on NuttX? Read the [Getting Started](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/quickstart/index.html) guide!\nIf you don't have a board available, NuttX has its own simulator that you can run on terminal.\n\n## Documentation\nYou can find the current NuttX documentation on the [Documentation Page](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/).\n\nAlternatively, you can build the documentation yourself by following the Documentation Build [Instructions](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/documentation.html).\n\nThe old NuttX documentation is still available in the [Apache wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/NUTTX/NuttX).\n\n## Supported Boards\nNuttX supports a wide variety of platforms. See the full list on the [Supported Platforms](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/platforms/index.html) page.\n\n## Contributing\nIf you wish to contribute to the NuttX project, read the [Contributing](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/index.html) guidelines for information on Git usage, coding standard, workflow and the NuttX principles.\n\n## License\nThe code in this repository is under either the Apache 2 license, or a license compatible with the Apache 2 license.

Over the course of time, NuttX has\nused several different repositories: CVS, two SVN repositories, and\ncurrently a GIT repository. Therefore, revision information specific to an\nolder repository may not be meaningful today.\n\nTo make it easier to track there older versions in the current GIT\nrepository, a GIT lightweight tag has been applied for each release. The\ntag name is the release name (for example, the release 6.27 has tag name\n\"nuttx-6.27\").\n\nNOTE\n====\nThe ReleaseNotes have moved to Documentation/ReleaseNotes/\n"
