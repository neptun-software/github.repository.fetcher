The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n  wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.\nNotwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public\nlicenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be\nconsidered the \"Licensor.\" Except for the limited purpose of indicating\nthat material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as\notherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at\ncreativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the\nuse of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any other trademark or logo\nof Creative Commons without its prior written consent including,\nwithout limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications\nto any of its public licenses or any other arrangements,\nunderstandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

(support for armeabi has been removed since r17)\n\n* Build and install the native libraries.\n\n```\n./build_libs.sh\n./install_libs.sh\n```\n\n\n## Demo\n\n```\ncd ./xhookwrapper/\n./gradlew assembleDebug\nadb install ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk\n```\n\n\n## API\n\nExternal API header file: `libxhook/jni/xhook.h`\n\n### 1. Register hook info\n\n```c\nint xhook_register(const char  *pathname_regex_str,  \n                   const char  *symbol,  \n                   void        *new_func,  \n                   void       **old_func);\n```\n\nIn current process's memory space, in every loaded ELF which pathname matches regular expression `pathname_regex_str`, every PLT entries to `symbol` will be **replaced with** `new_func`. The original one will be saved in `old_func`.\n\nThe `new_func` **must** have the same function declaration as the original one.\n\nReturn zero if successful, non-zero otherwise.\n\nThe regular expression for `pathname_regex_str` only support **POSIX BRE (Basic Regular Expression)**.\n\n### 2. Ignore some hook info\n\n```c\nint xhook_ignore(const char *pathname_regex_str,  \n                 const char *symbol);\n```\n\nIgnore some hook info according to `pathname_regex_str` and `symbol`, from registered hooks by `xhook_register`. If `symbol` is `NULL`, xhook will ignore all symbols from ELF which pathname matches `pathname_regex_str`.\n\nReturn zero if successful, non-zero otherwise.\n\nThe regular expression for `pathname_regex_str` only support **POSIX BRE**.\n\n### 3. Do hook\n\n```c\nint xhook_refresh(int async);\n```\n\nDo the real hook operations according to the registered hook info.\n\nPass `1` to `async` for asynchronous hook. Pass `0` to `async` for synchronous hook.\n\nReturn zero if successful, non-zero otherwise.\n\nxhook will keep a global cache for saving the last ELF loading info from `/proc/self/maps`. This cache will also be updated in `xhook_refresh`. With this cache, `xhook_refresh` can determine which ELF is newly loaded. We only need to do hook in these newly loaded ELF.\n\n### 4. Clear cache\n\n```c\nvoid xhook_clear();\n```\n\nClear all cache owned by xhook, reset all global flags to default value.\n\nIf you confirm that all PLT entries you want have been hooked, you could call this function to save some memory.\n\n### 5. Enable/Disable debug info\n\n```c\nvoid xhook_enable_debug(int flag);\n```\n\nPass `1` to `flag` for enable debug info. Pass `0` to `flag` for disable. (**disabled** by default)\n\nDebug info will be sent to logcat with tag `xhook`.\n\n### 6. Enable/Disable SFP (segmentation fault protection)\n\n```c\nvoid xhook_enable_sigsegv_protection(int flag);\n```\n\nPass `1` to `flag` for enable SFP. Pass `0` to `flag` for disable. (**enabled** by default) \n\nxhook is NOT a compliant business layer library. We have to calculate the value of some pointers directly. Reading or writing the memory pointed to by these pointers will cause a segmentation fault in some unusual situations and environment. The APP crash rate increased which caused by xhook is about one ten-millionth (0.0000001) according to our test. (The increased crash rate is also related to the ELFs and symbols you need to hook). Finally, we have to use some trick to prevent this harmless crashing. We called it SFP (segmentation fault protection) which consists of: `sigaction()`, `SIGSEGV`, `siglongjmp()` and `sigsetjmp()`.\n\n**You should always enable SFP for release-APP, this will prevent your app from crashing. On the other hand, you should always disable SFP for debug-APP, so you can't miss any common coding mistakes that should be fixed.**\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```c\n//detect memory leaks\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"malloc\",  my_malloc,  NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"calloc\",  my_calloc,  NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"realloc\", my_realloc, NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"free\",    my_free,    NULL);\n\n//inspect sockets lifecycle\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"getaddrinfo\", my_getaddrinfo, NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"socket\",      my_socket,      NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"setsockopt\"   my_setsockopt,  NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"bind\",        my_bind,        NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"listen\",      my_listen,      NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"connect\",     my_connect,     NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"shutdown\",    my_shutdown,    NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"close\",       my_close,       NULL);\n\n//filter off and save some android log to local file\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"__android_log_write\",  my_log_write,  NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"__android_log_print\",  my_log_print,  NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"__android_log_vprint\", my_log_vprint, NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"__android_log_assert\", my_log_assert, NULL);\n\n//tracking (ignore linker and linker64)\nxhook_register(\"^/system/.*$\", \"mmap\",   my_mmap,   NULL);\nxhook_register(\"^/vendor/.*$\", \"munmap\", my_munmap, NULL);\nxhook_ignore  (\".*/linker$\",   \"mmap\");\nxhook_ignore  (\".*/linker$\",   \"munmap\");\nxhook_ignore  (\".*/linker64$\", \"mmap\");\nxhook_ignore  (\".*/linker64$\", \"munmap\");\n\n//defense to some injection attacks\nxhook_register(\".*com\\\\.hacker.*\\\\.so$\", \"malloc\",  my_malloc_always_return_NULL, NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*/libhacker\\\\.so$\",     \"connect\", my_connect_with_recorder,     NULL);\n\n//fix some system bug\nxhook_register(\".*some_vendor.*/libvictim\\\\.so$\", \"bad_func\", my_nice_func, NULL);\n\n//ignore all hooks in libwebviewchromium.so\nxhook_ignore(\".*/libwebviewchromium.so$\", NULL);\n\n//hook now!\nxhook_refresh(1);\n```\n\n\n## Support\n\n* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/iqiyi/xHook/issues)\n* [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/iqiyi/xHook/discussions)\n* [Telegram Public Group](https://t.me/android_native_geeks)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [xHook Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## License\n\nxHook is MIT licensed, as found in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n\nxHook documentation is Creative Commons licensed, as found in the [LICENSE-docs](LICENSE-docs) file.\n"

English Version](README.md)\n\n[Android PLT hook 概述 中文版](docs/overview/android_plt_hook_overview.zh-CN.md)\n\nxHook 是一个针对 Android 平台 ELF (可执行文件和动态库) 的 PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) hook 库。\n\nxHook 一直在稳定性和兼容性方面做着持续的优化。\n\n\n## 特征\n\n* 支持 Android 4.0 - 10（API level 14 - 29）。\n* 支持 armeabi，armeabi-v7a，arm64-v8a，x86 和 x86_64。\n* 支持 **ELF HASH** 和 **GNU HASH** 索引的符号。\n* 支持 **SLEB128** 编码的重定位信息。\n* 支持通过正则表达式批量设置 hook 信息。\n* 不需要 root 权限或任何系统权限。\n* 不依赖于任何的第三方动态库。\n\n\n## 编译\n\n* 下载 [Android NDK r16b](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/revision_history.html)，设置 PATH 环境变量。（对 armeabi 的支持，从 r17 版本开始被移除了）\n\n* 编译和安装 native 库。\n\n```\n./build_libs.sh\n./install_libs.sh\n```\n\n\n## Demo\n\n```\ncd ./xhookwrapper/\n./gradlew assembleDebug\nadb install ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n外部 API 头文件: `libxhook/jni/xhook.h`\n\n### 1. 注册 hook 信息\n\n```c\nint xhook_register(const char  *pathname_regex_str,  \n                   const char  *symbol,  \n                   void        *new_func,  \n                   void       **old_func);\n```\n\n在当前进程的内存空间中，在每一个符合正则表达式 `pathname_regex_str` 的已加载ELF中，每一个调用 `symbol` 的 PLT 入口点的地址值都将给替换成 `new_func`。之前的 PLT 入口点的地址值将被保存在 `old_func` 中。\n\n`new_func` 必须具有和原函数同样的函数声明。\n\n成功返回 0，失败返回 非0。\n\n`pathname_regex_str` 只支持 **POSIX BRE (Basic Regular Expression)** 定义的正则表达式语法。\n\n### 2. 忽略部分 hook 信息\n\n```c\nint xhook_ignore(const char *pathname_regex_str,  \n                 const char *symbol);\n```\n\n根据 `pathname_regex_str` 和 `symbol`，从已经通过 `xhook_register` 注册的 hook 信息中，忽略一部分 hook 信息。如果 `symbol` 为 `NULL`，xhook 将忽略所有路径名符合正则表达式 `pathname_regex_str` 的 ELF。\n\n成功返回 0，失败返回 非0。\n\n`pathname_regex_str` 只支持 **POSIX BRE** 定义的正则表达式语法。\n\n### 3. 执行 hook\n\n```c\nint xhook_refresh(int async);\n```\n\n根据前面注册的 hook 信息，执行真正的 hook 操作。\n\n给 `async` 参数传 `1` 表示执行异步的 hook 操作，传 `0` 表示执行同步的 hook 操作。\n\n成功返回 0，失败返回 非0。\n\nxhook 在内部维护了一个全局的缓存，用于保存最后一次从 `/proc/self/maps` 读取到的 ELF 加载信息。每次一调用 `xhook_refresh` 函数，这个缓存都将被更新。xhook 使用这个缓存来判断哪些 ELF 是这次新被加载到内存中的。我们每次只需要针对这些新加载的 ELF 做 hook 就可以了。\n\n### 4. 清除缓存\n\n```c\nvoid xhook_clear();\n```\n\n清除 xhook 的缓存，重置所有的全局标示。\n\n如果你确定你需要的所有 PLT 入口点都已经被替换了，你可以调用这个函数来释放和节省一些内存空间。\n\n### 5. 启用/禁用 调试信息\n\n```c\nvoid xhook_enable_debug(int flag);\n```\n\n给 `flag` 参数传 `1` 表示启用调试信息，传 `0` 表示禁用调试信息。 (默认为：**禁用**)\n\n调试信息将被输出到 logcat，对应的 TAG 为：`xhook`。\n\n### 6. 启用/禁用 SFP (段错误保护)\n\n```c\nvoid xhook_enable_sigsegv_protection(int flag);\n```\n\n给 `flag` 参数传 `1` 表示启用 SFP，传 `0` 表示禁用 SFP。 (默认为：**启用**)\n\nxhook 并不是一个常规的业务层的动态库。在 xhook 中，我们不得不直接计算一些内存指针的值。在一些极端的情况和环境下，读或者写这些指针指向的内存会发生段错误。根据我们的测试，xhook 的行为将导致 APP 崩溃率增加 “一千万分之一” (0.0000001)。（具体崩溃率可能会增加多少，也和你想要 hook 的库和符号有关）。最终，我们不得不使用某些方法来防止这些无害的崩溃。我们叫它SFP (段错误保护)，它是由这些调用和值组成的：`sigaction()`， `SIGSEGV`， `siglongjmp()` 和 `sigsetjmp()`。\n\n**在 release 版本的 APP 中，你应该始终启用 SFP，这能防止你的 APP 因为 xhook 而崩溃。在 debug 版本的 APP 中，你应该始终禁用 SFP，这样你就不会丢失那些一般性的编码失误导致的段错误，这些段错误是应该被修复的。**\n\n\n## 例子\n\n```c\n//监测内存泄露\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"malloc\",  my_malloc,  NULL);\nxhook_register(\".*\\\\.so$\", \"calloc\",  my_calloc,
