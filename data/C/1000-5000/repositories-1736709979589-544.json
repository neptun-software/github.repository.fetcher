I fixed\nwhatever bug I found, and added features I wanted. Things seem stable, but don't\nquote me on it. I will most likely be actively working on this until I get the\nfeatures I want. This is also a learning experience for me. That is, I'm\npartially doing this out of a desire to learn Xlib.\n\n## Changes from xcompmgr:\n\n* OpenGL backend (`--backend glx`), in addition to the old X Render backend.\n* Inactive window transparency (`-i`) / dimming (`--inactive-dim`).\n* Titlebar/frame transparency (`-e`).\n* Menu transparency (`-m`, thanks to Dana).\n* shadows are now enabled for argb windows, e.g. terminals with transparency\n* removed serverside shadows (and simple compositing) to clean the code,\n  the only option that remains is clientside shadows\n* configuration files (see the man page for more details)\n* colored shadows (`--shadow-[red/green/blue]`)\n* a new fade system\n* VSync support (not always working)\n* Blur of background of transparent windows, window color inversion (bad in performance)\n* Some more options...\n\n## Fixes from the original xcompmgr:\n\n* fixed a segfault when opening certain window types\n* fixed a memory leak caused by not freeing up shadows (from the freedesktop\n  repo)\n* fixed the conflict with chromium and similar windows\n* [many more](https://github.com/chjj/compton/issues)\n\n## Building\n\n### Dependencies:\n\n__B__ for build-time\n\n__R__ for runtime\n\n* libx11 (B,R)\n* libxcomposite (B,R)\n* libxdamage (B,R)\n* libxfixes (B,R)\n* libXext (B,R)\n* libxrender (B,R)\n* libXrandr (B,R)\n* libXinerama (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_XINERAMA` at compile time)\n* pkg-config (B)\n* make (B)\n* xproto / x11proto (B)\n* sh (R)\n* xprop,xwininfo / x11-utils (R)\n* libpcre (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_REGEX_PCRE` at compile time)\n* libconfig (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_LIBCONFIG` at compile time)\n* libdrm (B) (Can be disabled with `NO_VSYNC_DRM` at compile time)\n* libGL (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_VSYNC_OPENGL` at compile time)\n* libdbus (B,R) (Can be disabled with `NO_DBUS` at compile time)\n* asciidoc (B) (and docbook-xml-dtd-4.5, libxml-utils, libxslt, xsltproc, xmlto, etc. if your distro doesn't pull them in)\n\n### How to build\n\nTo build, make sure you have the dependencies above:\n\n```bash\n# Make the main program\n$ make\n# Make the man pages\n$ make docs\n# Install\n$ make install\n```\n\n(Compton does include a `_CMakeLists.txt` in the tree, but we haven't decided whether we should switch to CMake yet. The `Makefile` is fully usable right now.)\n\n## Known issues\n\n* Our [FAQ](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/faq) covers some known issues.\n\n* VSync does not work too well. You may check the [VSync Guide](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/vsync-guide) for how to get (possibly) better effects.\n\n* If `--unredir-if-possible` is enabled, when compton redirects/unredirects windows, the screen may flicker. Using `--paint-on-overlay` minimizes the problem from my observation, yet I do not know if there's a cure.\n\n* compton may not track focus correctly in all situations. The focus tracking code is experimental. `--use-ewmh-active-win` might be helpful.\n\n* The performance of blur under X Render backend might be pretty bad. OpenGL backend could be faster.\n\n* With `--blur-background` you may sometimes see weird lines around damaged area. `--resize-damage YOUR_BLUR_RADIUS` might be helpful in the case.\n\n## Usage\n\nPlease refer to the Asciidoc man pages (`man/compton.1.asciidoc` & `man/compton-trans.1.asciidoc`) for more details and examples.\n\nNote a sample configuration file `compton.sample.conf` is included in the repository.\n\n## Support\n\n* Bug reports and feature requests should go to the \"Issues\" section above.\n\n* Our (semi?) official IRC channel is #compton on FreeNode.\n\n* Some information is available on the wiki, including [FAQ](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/faq), [VSync Guide](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/vsync-guide), and [Performance Guide](https://github.com/chjj/compton/wiki/perf-guide).\n\n## License\n\nAlthough compton has kind of taken on a life of its own, it was originally\nan xcompmgr fork. xcompmgr has gotten around. As far as I can tell, the lineage\nfor this particular tree is something like:\n\n* Keith Packard (original author)\n* Matthew Hawn\n* ...\n* Dana Jansens\n* chjj and richardgv\n\nNot counting the tens of people who forked it in between.\n\nCompton is distributed under MIT license, as far as I (richardgv) know. See LICENSE for more info.\n"
