These\nscripts have access to many of the APIs available to full-fledged Android\napplications, but with a greatly simplified interface that makes it easy to get\nthings done.\n\nScripts can be run interactively in a terminal and in the background.  Python,\nPerl, JRuby, Lua, BeanShell, JavaScript, Tcl, and shell are currently supported,\nand we're planning to add more. See the [SL4A Video\nHelp](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL07A81E6CE96F158B) playlist on\nYouTube for various demonstrations of SL4A's features.\n\nSL4A is designed for developers and is _alpha_ quality software.\n\n##Disclaimer\n\n  * Even though a lot of contributors are working for Google, this is not an\n    official Google product.\n  * SL4A is no longer under active development. However, some forks of this\n    project may be.\n\n##Documentation\n\nThe original Google Code wiki has been converted to Markdown and is available in the wiki\nbranch. A few of the most important pages are:\n\n  * [FAQ](https://github.com/damonkohler/sl4a/blob/wiki/FAQ.md)\n  * [User Guide](https://github.com/damonkohler/sl4a/blob/wiki/UserGuide.md)\n  * [API Reference](https://github.com/damonkohler/sl4a/blob/wiki/ApiReference.md)\n\n##Issues\n\nIssues have been migrated from Google Code. However, this probject is no longer under active development. Consider responding to and filing new issues against an active fork.\n\n##Support\n\nSupport for SL4A is provided by the community on the [project mailing\nlist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-scripting).\n"
