By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.

It is a set\nof plugins that help to synchronize a debugging session\n(WinDbg/GDB/LLDB/OllyDbg/OllyDbg2/x64dbg) with a disassembler (IDA/Ghidra/Binary Ninja).\nThe underlying idea is simple: take the best from both worlds (static and\ndynamic analysis).\n\nDebuggers and dynamic analysis provide us with:\n\n* local view, with live dynamic context (registers, memory, *etc.*)\n* built-in specialized features/API (ex: WinDbg's ``!peb``, ``!drvobj``,\n``!address``, *etc.*)\n\nDisassemblers and static analysis provide us with:\n\n* macro view over modules\n* code analysis, signatures, types, *etc.*\n* fancy graph view\n* decompilation\n* persistent storage of knowledge within IDBs/GPRs\n\nKey features:\n\n* synchronize graph and decompilation views with debugger's state\n* no need to deal with ASLR, addresses are rebased on-the-fly\n* pass data (comment, command output) from debugger to disassembler\n* multiple IDBs/GPRs can be synced at the same time allowing to easily trace\n  through multiple modules\n* disassembler and debugger can be on different hosts / VMs\n\n**ret-sync** is a fork of [qb-sync](https://github.com/quarkslab/qb-sync)\nthat I developed and maintained during my stay at\n[Quarkslab](http://www.quarkslab.com).\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Table of contents\n\n- [Repository content](#repository-content)\n- [General prerequisites](#general-prerequisites)\n- [Binary release](#binary-release)\n- [**ret-sync** configuration](#ret-sync-configuration)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  - [IDA extension](#ida-extension)\n  - [Ghidra extension](#ghidra-extension)\n  - [Binary Ninja extension](#binary-ninja-extension)\n  - [WinDbg extension](#windbg-extension)\n  - [GNU gdb (GDB) installation](#gnu-gdb-gdb-installation)\n  - [LLDB installation](#lldb-installation)\n  - [OllyDbg 1.10 installation](#ollydbg-110-installation)\n  - [OllyDbg2 installation](#ollydbg2-installation)\n  - [x64dbg installation](#x64dbg-installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  - [**ret-sync** debugger commands](#ret-sync-debugger-commands)\n  - [IDA usage](#ida-usage)\n  - [Ghidra usage](#ghidra-usage)\n  - [Binary Ninja usage](#binary-ninja-usage)\n  - [WinDbg usage](#windbg-usage)\n  - [GNU gdb (GDB) usage](#gnu-gdb-gdb-usage)\n  - [LLDB usage](#lldb-usage)\n  - [OllyDbg 1.10 usage](#ollydbg-110-usage)\n  - [OllyDbg2 usage](#ollydbg2-usage)\n  - [x64dbg usage](#x64dbg-usage)\n  - [Python library usage](#python-library-usage)\n- [Extend](#extend)\n- [TODO](#todo)\n- [Known Bugs/Limitations](#known-bugslimitations)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Greetz](#greetz)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Repository content\n\nThe debugger plugins:\n\n* `ext_windbg/sync`: WinDbg extension source files, once built: `sync.dll`\n* `ext_gdb/sync.py`: GDB plugin\n* `ext_lldb/sync.py`: LLDB plugin\n* `ext_olly1`: OllyDbg 1.10 plugin\n* `ext_olly2`: OllyDbg v2 plugin\n* `ext_x64dbg`: x64dbg plugin\n\nThe disassembler plugins:\n\n* `ext_ida/SyncPlugin.py`\n* `ext_ghidra/dist/ghidra_*_retsync.zip`: Ghidra plugin\n* `ext_bn/retsync`: Binary Ninja plugin\n\n\nAnd the library plugin:\n\n* `ext_lib/sync.py`: standalone Python library\n\n\n# General prerequisites\n\nIDA and GDB plugins require a valid Python setup. Python 2 (>=2.7) and Python\n3 are supported.\n\n\n# Binary release\n\nPre-built binaries for WinDbg/OllyDbg/OllyDbg2/x64dbg debuggers are proposed\nthrough an ``Azure DevOps`` pipeline: [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/bootlegdev/ret-sync-release/_apis/build/status/ret-sync-release-CI?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/bootlegdev/ret-sync-release/_build/latest/ret-sync-release-CI?definitionId=8?branchName=master)\n\nSelect the last build and check the artifacts under the ``Related`` section: ``6 published``.\n\n![](img/pipeline.png)\n\n\nA pre-built plugin archive of the Ghidra plugin is provided in `ext_ghidra/dist`.\n\n\n# **ret-sync** configuration\n\n**ret-sync** should work out of the box for most users with a typical setup:\ndebugger and disassembler(s) on the same host, module names matching.\n\nStill, in some scenarios a specific configuration may be used. For that,\nextensions and plugins check for an optional global configuration file named\n`.sync` in the user's home directory. It must be a valid ``.INI`` file.\n\nAdditionally, the IDA and Ghidra plugins also look for the configuration file\nin the IDB or project directory (`<project>.rep`) first to allow local,\nper-IDB/project, settings. If a local configuration file is present, the\nglobal configuration file is ignored.\n\nValues declared in these configuration files override default values. Please\nnote, that **no** `.sync` file is created by default.\n\nBelow we detail, three common scenarios where a configuration file is\nuseful/needed:\n\n* Remote debugging\n* Modules names mismatch\n* Missing PID\n\n\n## Remote debugging: debugger and disassembler are on different hosts\n\nThe ``[INTERFACE]`` section is used to customize network related settings.\nLet's suppose one wants to synchronize IDA with a debugger running inside a\nvirtual machine (or simply another host), common remote kernel debugging\nscenario.\n\nSimply create two ``.sync`` file:\n\n* one on the machine where IDA is installed, in the IDB directory:\n* For Ghidra, place at home directory, ex. \"/home/user\" or \"C:\\Users\\user\".\n```\n[INTERFACE]\nhost=192.168.128.1\nport=9234\n```\n\nIt tells **ret-sync** ``IDA`` plugin to listen on the interface\n``192.168.128.1`` with port ``9234``. It goes without saying that this\ninterface must be reachable from the remote host or virtual machine.\n\n* one on the machine where the debugger is executed, in the user's home directory:\n\n```\n[INTERFACE]\nhost=192.168.128.1\nport=9234\n```\n\nIt tells **ret-sync** debugger plugin to connect to the **ret-sync** ``IDA``\nplugin configured previously to listen in this interface.\n\n\n***NOTE:*** You must specify a real IP here, and not use `0.0.0.0`. This is\nbecause the variable is used by multiple sources both for binding and\nconnecting, so using `0.0.0.0` will result in weird errors.\n\n\n\n## IDB and debugger modules names are different\n\n```\n[ALIASES]\nntoskrnl_vuln.exe=ntkrnlmp.exe\n```\n\nThe ``[ALIASES]`` section is used to customize the name which is used by a\ndisassembler (IDA/Ghidra) to register a module to its dispatcher/program\nmanager.\n\nBy default, disassembler plugins use the name of the input file. However one\nmay have renamed the file beforehand and it doesn't match anymore the name of\nthe actual process or loaded module as seen by the debugger.\n\nHere we simply tell to the dispatcher to match the name `ntkrnlmp.exe` (real\nname) instead of `ntoskrnl_vuln.exe` (IDB name).\n\n\n## gdb with Qt Creator debugging frontend\n\nThe Qt Creator debugging frontend changes the way gdb command output is logged. Since\nthis would interfere with the synchronization an option exists to use the raw gdb output\nfor synchronization instead of a temporary file. In the .sync configuration file use\n\n```\n[GENERAL]\nuse_tmp_logging_file=false\n```\n\nif you wish to use the Qt debugging frontend for the target.\n\n## Embedded devices and missing ``/proc/<pid>/maps``\n\nIn some scenarios, such as debugging embedded devices over serial or raw\nfirmware in QEMU, gdb is not aware of the PID and cannot access\n``/proc/<pid>/maps``.\n\nIn these cases, The ``[INIT]`` section is used to pass a custom context to the\nplugin. It allows overriding some fields such as the PID and memory mappings.\n\n`.sync` content extract:\n\n```\n[INIT]\ncontext = {\n      \"pid\": 200,\n      \"mappings\": [ [0x400000, 0x7A81158, 0x7681158, \"asav941-200.qcow2|lina\"] ]\n  }\n```\n\nEach entry in the mappings is: ``mem_base``, ``mem_end``, ``mem_size``, ``mem_name``.\n\n\n## Bypassing automatic address rebasing\n\nIn some scenarios, such as debugging embedded devices or connecting to\nminimalist debug interfaces, it may be more convenient to bypass the\nautomatic address rebasing feature implemented in the disassembler plugins.\n\nThe `use_raw_addr` option is currently supported only for Ghidra. In\nthe .sync configuration file use:\n\n```\n[GENERAL]\nuse_raw_addr=true\n```\n\n\n# Installation\n\n## IDA extension\n\n### IDA prerequisites\n\nIDA 7.x branch is required. For older versions (6.9x) please see archived\nrelease ``ida6.9x``.\n\n### Install the IDA extension\n\nFor IDA installation, copy ``Syncplugin.py`` and ``retsync`` folder from\n``ext_ida`` to IDA plugins directory, for example:\n\n* ``C:\\Program Files\\IDA Pro 7.4\\plugins``\n* ``%APPDATA%\\Hex-Rays\\IDA Pro\\plugins``\n* ``~/.idapro/plugins``\n\n### Run the IDA extension\n\n1. Open IDB\n2. Run the plugin in IDA (``Alt-Shift-S``) or ``Edit`` -> ``Plugins`` -> ``ret-sync``\n\n```\n[sync] default idb name: ld.exe\n[sync] sync enabled\n[sync] cmdline: \"C:\\Program Files\\Python38\\python.exe\" -u \"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Hex-Rays\\IDA Pro\\plugins\\retsync\\broker.py\" --idb \"target.exe\"\n[sync] module base 0x100400000\n[sync] hexrays #7.3.0.190614 found\n[sync] broker started\n[sync] plugin loaded\n[sync] << broker << dispatcher not found, trying to run it\n[sync] << broker << dispatcher now runs with pid: 6544\n[sync] << broker << connected to dispatcher\n[sync] << broker << listening on port 63107\n\n```\n\n### IDA plugin troubleshooting\n\nTo troubleshoot issues with the IDA extension two options are available in the\nfile `retsync/rsconfig.py`:\n\n```\nLOG_LEVEL = logging.INFO\nLOG_TO_FILE_ENABLE = False\n```\n\nSetting `LOG_LEVEL` value to ` logging.DEBUG` makes the plugin more verbose.\n\nSetting `LOG_TO_FILE_ENABLE` value to `True` triggers the logging of exception\ninformation from `broker.py` and `dispatcher.py` into dedicated files. Log file\nare generated in the `%TMP%` folder with a name pattern `retsync.%s.err` .\n\n\n## Ghidra extension\n\n### Build the Ghidra extension\n\nEither use the pre-built version from the `ext_ghidra/dist` folder or follow the instruction to build it.\nEach extension build only supports the version of Ghidra specified in the plugin's file name.\nE.g. `ghidra_9.1_PUBLIC_20191104_retsync.zip` is for Ghidra 9.1 Public.\n\n1. Install Ghidra\n2. Install gradle\n\n```bash\napt install gradle\n```\n\n3. Build extension for your Ghidra installation (replace `$GHIDRA_DIR` with your installation directory)\n\n```bash\ncd ext_ghidra\ngradle -PGHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=$GHIDRA_DIR\n```\n\n### Install the Ghidra extension\n\n1. From Ghidra projects manager: ``File`` -> ``Install Extensions...``, click on the\n   `+` sign and select the `ext_ghidra/dist/ghidra_*_retsync.zip` and click OK.\n   This will effectively extract the `retsync` folder from the zip into\n   `$GHIDRA_DIR/Extensions/Ghidra/`\n2. Restart Ghidra as requested\n3. After reloading Ghidra, open a module in CodeBrowser. It should tell you a\n   new extension plugin has been detected. Select \"yes\" to configure it. Then\n   tick \"RetSyncPlugin\" and click OK. The console should show something like:\n\n```\n[*] retsync init\n[>] programOpened: tm.sys\n    imageBase: 0x1c0000000\n```\n\n4. From Ghidra CodeBrowser tool: use toolbar icons or shortcuts to enable (``Alt+s``)/disable (``Alt+Shift+s``)/restart (``Alt+r``)\n   synchronization.\n\nA status window is also available from ``Windows`` -> ``RetSyncPlugin``. You\ngenerally want to drop it on the side to integrate it with the Ghidra\nenvironment windows.\n\n\n## Binary Ninja extension\n\nBinary Ninja support is experimental, make sure to backup your analysis\ndatabases.\n\n### Binary Ninja prerequisites\n\n**ret-sync** requires Binary Ninja version 2.2 at minimum as well as Python 3\n(Python 2 is not supported).\n\n\n### Install the Binary Ninja extension\n\n**ret-sync** is not yet distributed through the Binary Ninja's Plugin Manager;\na manual installation is required. Simply copy that content of the `ext_bn`\nfolder into Binary Ninja's plugins folder, for example:\n\n`%APPDATA%\\Binary Ninja\\plugins`\n\nAfter restarting Binary Ninja, the following output should be present in the\nconsole window:\n\n```\n[sync] commands added\nLoaded python3 plugin 'retsync'\n```\n\n\n## WinDbg extension\n\n### Build the WinDbg extension\n\nEither use pre-built binaries or use the Visual Studio 2017\nsolution provided in ``ext_windbg``, (see\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes if\nneeded).\n\nThis will build the `x64\\release\\sync.dll` file.\n\n### Install the WinDbg extension\n\nYou will need to copy the resulting `sync.dll` file into the\nappropriate Windbg extension path.\n\n* WinDbg Classic:\n\nFor earlier versions of Windbg this is is something like this (be\ncareful of ``x86``/``x64`` flavours), for example\n\n`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Debuggers\\x64\\winext\\sync.dll`\n\n* Windbg Preview\n\nThe folder for storing extension seems to be based on the PATH, so you need to\nput it one of the queried locations.\n\nOne example is to put it here:\n\n`C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\sync.dll`\n\n### Run the WinDbg extension\n\n1. Launch WinDbg on target\n2. Load extension (``.load`` command)\n\n```\n    0:000> .load sync\n    [sync.dll] DebugExtensionInitialize, ExtensionApis loaded\n```\n\n3. Sync WinDbg\n\n```\n      0:000> !sync\n      [sync] No argument found, using default host (127.0.0.1:9100)\n      [sync] sync success, sock 0x5a8\n      [sync] probing sync\n      [sync] sync is now enabled with host 127.0.0.1\n```\n\nE.g. in IDA's Output window\n\n```\n      [*] << broker << dispatcher msg: add new client (listening on port 63898), nb client(s): 1\n      [*] << broker << dispatcher msg: new debugger client: dbg connect - HostMachine\\HostUser\n      [sync] set debugger dialect to windbg, enabling hotkeys\n```\n\nIf Windbg's current module matches IDA file name\n\n```\n      [sync] idb is enabled with the idb client matching the module name.\n```\n\n### WinDbg installation troubleshooting\n\nNote: If you get the following error, it is because you haven't copied the file\nto the right folder in the above steps.\n\n```\n0: kd> .load sync\nThe call to LoadLibrary(sync) failed, Win32 error 0n2\n    \"The system cannot find the file specified.\"\nPlease check your debugger configuration and/or network access.\n```\n\nThe error below usually means that Windbg tried to load the incorrect flavour\nof the extension, ex: ``x64`` in place of the ``x86`` `sync.dll`.\n\n```\n0:000> .load sync\nThe call to LoadLibrary(sync) failed, Win32 error 0n193\n    \"%1 is not a valid Win32 application.\"\nPlease check your debugger configuration and/or network access.\n```\n\nAs WinDbg Preview loads both plugins (``x86`` and  ``x64``) from the same\ndirectory, one can rename the ``x86`` file `sync32.dll`.\n\n```\n0:000> .load sync32\n```\n\n\n## GNU gdb (GDB) installation\n\n1. Copy the `ext_gdb/sync.py` to the directory of your choice\n2. Load the extension (see auto-load-scripts)\n\n```\n    gdb> source sync.py\n    [sync] configuration file loaded 192.168.52.1:9100\n    [sync] commands added\n```\n\n## LLDB installation\n\nLLDB support is experimental, however:\n\n1. Load extension (can also be added in ``~/.lldbinit``)\n\n```\n    lldb> command script import sync\n```\n\n## OllyDbg 1.10 installation\n\nOllyDbg 1.10 support is experimental, however:\n\n1. Build the plugin using the VS solution (optional, see pre-built binaries)\n2. Copy the dll within OllyDbg's plugin directory\n\n## OllyDbg2 installation\n\nOllyDbg2 support is experimental, however:\n\n1. Build the plugin using the VS solution (optional, see pre-built binaries)\n2. Copy the dll within OllyDbg2's plugin directory\n\n## x64dbg installation\n\nBased on testplugin,  https://github.com/x64dbg/testplugin. x64dbg support is experimental, however:\n\n1. Build the plugin using the VS solution (optional, see pre-built binaries).\n   May you need a different version of the plugin sdk,\n   a copy can be found in each release of x64dbg.\n   Paste the \"``pluginsdk``\" directory into \"``ext_x64dbg\\x64dbg_sync``\"\n2. Copy the dll (extension is ``.d32`` or ``.dp64``) within x64dbg's plugin directory.\n\n# Usage\n\n## **ret-sync** debugger commands\n\nFor command-line oriented debuggers (mainly Windbg and GDB) a set of commands\nis exposed by **ret-sync** to assist in the reverse-engineering task.\n\nThe commands below are generic (Windbg and GDB), please note that a `!`\nprefix is needed on WinDbg (e.g.: `sync`  in GDB, `!sync` in Windbg).\n\n| Debugger command           | Description                                                                               |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `synchelp`                   | Display the list of available commands with short explanation                             |\n| `sync`                       | Start synchronization                                                                     |\n| `syncoff`                    | Stop synchronization                                                                      |\n| `cmt [-a address] <string>`  | Add a comment at current ip in disassembler                                               |\n| `rcmt [-a address]`          | Reset comment at current ip in disassembler                                               |\n| `fcmt [-a address] <string>` | Add a function comment for function in which current ip is located                        |\n| `raddr <expression>`         | Add a comment with rebased address evaluated from expression                              |\n| `rln <expression>`           | Get symbol from the disassembler for the given address                                    |\n| `lbl [-a address] <string>`  | Add a label name at current ip in disassembler                                            |\n| `cmd <string>`               | Execute a command in debugger and add its output as comment at current ip in disassembler |\n| `bc <\\|\\|on\\|off\\|set 0xBBGGRR>` | Enable/disable path coloring in disassembler                                              |\n| `idblist`                    | Get list of all IDB clients connected to the dispatcher                                   |\n| `syncmodauto <on\\|off>`       | Enable/disable disassembler auto switch based on module name                              |\n| `idbn <n>`                   | Set active IDB to the nth client                                                          |\n| `jmpto <expression>`         |                                                                                           |\n| `jmpraw <expression>` | If an IDB is enabled then disassembler's view is synced with the resulting address.    |\n| `translate <base> <addr> <mod>` | rebase an address with respect to its module's name and offset   |\n\n\nWinDbg specific commands:\n\n| Debugger command           | Description                                                                               |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `curmod`  |  Display module infomation for current instruction offset (for troubleshooting) |\n| `modlist`  |  Debugger Markup Language (DML) enhanced module list meant for smoother active idb switching  |\n| `idb <module name>`  |  Set given module as the active idb (see `modlist` enhanced version of `lm`) |\n| `modmap <base> <size> <name>` |  A synthetic (\"faked\") module (defined using its base address and size) is added to the debugger internal list  |\n| `modunmap <base>` |  Remove a previously mapped synthetic module at base address  |\n| `modcheck <\\|\\|md5>`  |  Use to check if current module really matches IDB's file (ex: module has been updated)  |\n| `bpcmds <\\|\\|save\\|load\\|>` | **bpcmds** wrapper, save and reload **.bpcmds** (breakpoints commands list) output to current IDB  |\n| `ks` | Debugger Markup Language (DML) enhanced output of **kv** command   |\n\n\nGDB specific commands:\n\n| Debugger command           | Description                                                                               |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|`bbt` |  Beautiful backtrace.

It is the name that is used by the plugin to register with the\ndispatcher. IDB automatic switch is based on module name matching. In case of\nconflicting names (like a ``foo.exe`` and ``foo.dll``), this can be used to\nease matching. Please note, if you modify the input field while the sync is\nactive, you have to re-register with the dispatcher; this can be done simply\nby using the \"``Restart``\" button.\n\nAs a reminder it is possible to alias by default using the ``.sync`` configuration file.\n\n\n\n### IDA global shortcuts\n\n**ret-sync** defines these global shortcuts in IDA:\n\n* ``Alt-Shift-S``  - Run **ret-sync** plugin\n* ``Ctrl-Shift-S``  - Toggle global syncing\n* ``Ctrl-H``  - Toggle Hex-Rays syncing\n\nTwo buttons are also available in the Debug toolbar to toggle global and\nHex-Rays syncing.\n\n### IDA bindings over debugger commands\n\n``Syncplugin.py`` also registers debugger command wrapper hotkeys.\n\n* ``F2`` - Set breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``F3`` - Set one-shot breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Ctrl-F2`` - Set hardware breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Ctrl-F3`` - Set one-shot hardware breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Alt-F2`` - Translate (rebase in debugger) current cursor address\n* ``Alt-F5`` - Go\n* ``Ctrl-Alt-F5`` - Run (GDB only)\n* ``F10`` - Single step\n* ``F11`` - Single trace\n\nThese commands are only available when the current IDB is active. When\npossible they have also been implemented for others debuggers.\n\n## Ghidra usage\n\n### Ghidra plugin's GUI\n\nOnce the RetSyncPlugin opened, you can add it to the CodeBrowser window by simple\ndrag'n'drop:\n\n![](img/ghidra.png)\n\nIf you want to view several modules, files need to be open in the same CodeBrowser\nviewer, simply drag'n'drop the additional ones in the CodeBrowser window to obtain\nthe result as above.\n\n### Ghidra global shortcuts\n\n**ret-sync** defines these global shortcuts in Ghidra:\n\n* ``Alt-S``  - Enable syncing\n* ``Alt-Shift-S``  - Disable syncing\n* ``Alt-R``  - Restart syncing\n* ``Alt-Shift-R``  - Reload configuration\n\n### Ghidra bindings over debugger commands\n\nBindings over debugger commands are also implemented. They are similar to the\nones from IDA's extension (except the \"Go\" command).\n\n* ``F2``  - Set breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Ctrl-F2`` - Set hardware breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Alt-F3`` - Set one-shot breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Ctrl-F3`` - Set one-shot hardware breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Alt-F2`` - Translate (rebase in debugger) current cursor address\n* ``F5`` - Go\n* ``Alt-F5`` - Run (GDB only)\n* ``F10`` - Single step\n* ``F11`` - Single trace\n\n\n## Binary Ninja usage\n\n### Binary Ninja global shortcuts\n\n**ret-sync** defines these global shortcuts in Binary Ninja:\n\n* ``Alt-S``  - Enable syncing\n* ``Alt-Shift-S``  - Disable syncing\n\n\n### Binary Ninja shortcuts\n\nBindings over debugger commands are also implemented. They are similar to the\nones from IDA's extension.\n\n* ``F2``  - Set breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Ctrl-F2`` - Set hardware breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Alt-F3`` - Set one-shot breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Ctrl-F3`` - Set one-shot hardware breakpoint at cursor address\n* ``Alt-F2`` - Translate (rebase in debugger) current cursor address\n* ``Alt-F5`` - Go\n* ``F10`` - Single step\n* ``F11`` - Single trace\n\n\n## WinDbg usage\n\n### WinDbg plugin commands\n\n* **!sync**: Start synchronization\n* **!syncoff**: Stop synchronization\n* **!synchelp**: Display the list of available commands with short explanation.\n* **!cmt [-a address] <string>**: Add comment at current ip in IDA\n\n```\n    [WinDbg]\n    0:000:x86> pr\n    eax=00000032 ebx=00000032 ecx=00000032 edx=0028eebc esi=00000032 edi=00000064\n    eip=00430db1 esp=0028ed94 ebp=00000000 iopl=0         nv up ei pl nz na po nc\n    cs=0023  ss=002b  ds=002b  es=002b  fs=0053  gs=002b             efl=00000202\n    image00000000_00400000+0x30db1:\n    00430db1 57    push    edi\n\n    0:000:x86> dd esp 8\n    0028ed94  00000000 00433845 0028eebc 00000032\n    0028eda4  0028f88c 00000064 002b049e 00000110\n\n    0:000:x86> !cmt 0028ed94  00000000 00433845 0028eebc 00000032\n    [sync.dll]  !cmt called\n\n    [IDA]\n    .text:00430DB1    push    edi             ; 0028ed94  00000000 00433845 0028eebc 00000032\n```\n\n* **!rcmt [-a address]**: Reset comment at current ip in IDA\n\n```\n    [WinDbg]\n    0:000:x86> !rcmt\n    [sync] !rcmt called\n\n    [IDA]\n    .text:00430DB1    push    edi\n```\n\n* **!fcmt [-a address] <string>**: Add a function comment for function in which current ip is located\n\n```\n    [WinDbg]\n    0:000:x86> !fcmt decodes buffer with key\n    [sync] !fcmt called\n\n    [IDA]\n    .text:004012E0 ; decodes buffer with key\n    .text:004012E0                 public decrypt_func\n    .text:004012E0 decrypt_func    proc near\n    .text:004012E0                 push    ebp\n```\n\nNote: calling this command without argument reset the function's comment.\n\n* **!raddr <expression>**: Add a comment with rebased address evaluated from expression\n* **!rln <expression>**: Get symbol from the disassembler for the given address\n* **!lbl [-a address] <string>**: Add a label name at current ip in disassembler\n\n```\n    [WinDbg]\n    0:000:x86> !lbl meaningful_label\n    [sync] !lbl called\n\n    [IDA]\n    .text:000000000040271E meaningful_label:\n    .text:000000000040271E    mov     rdx, rsp\n```\n\n* **!cmd <string>**: Execute a command in WinDbg and add its output as comment at current ip in disassembler\n\n```\n    [WinDbg]\n    0:000:x86> pr\n    eax=00000032 ebx=00000032 ecx=00000032 edx=0028eebc esi=00000032 edi=00000064\n    eip=00430db1 esp=0028ed94 ebp=00000000 iopl=0         nv up ei pl nz na po nc\n    cs=0023  ss=002b  ds=002b  es=002b  fs=0053  gs=002b             efl=00000202\n    image00000000_00400000+0x30db1:\n    00430db1 57     push    edi\n    [sync.dll]  !cmd r edi\n\n    [IDA]\n    .text:00430DB1    push    edi             ; edi=00000064\n```\n\n* **!bc <||on|off|set 0xBBGGRR>** : Enable/disable path coloring in disassembler.\n  This is NOT a code tracing tool,\n  there are efficient tools for that. Each manually stepped instruction is\n  colored in the graph. Color a single instruction at current ip if called\n  without argument.\n  \"set\" argument is used to set path color with a new hex rgb code (reset color\n  if called with a value > 0xFFFFFF).\n* **!idblist**: Get list of all IDB clients connected to the dispatcher:\n\n```\n    [WinDbg]\n    0:000> !idblist\n    > currently connected idb(s):\n        [0] target.exe\n```\n\n* **!syncmodauto <on|off>**: Enable/disable disassembler auto switch based on module name:\n\n```\n    [WinDbg]\n    0:000> !syncmodauto off\n\n    [IDA]\n    [*] << broker << dispatcher msg: sync mode auto set to off\n```\n\n* **!idbn <n>**: Set active IDB to the nth client. n should be a valid decimal value.\n  This is a semi-automatic mode (personal tribute to the tremendous jj)\n\n```\n    [WinDbg]\n    0:000:> !idbn 0\n    > current idb set to 0\n```\n\nIn this example, current active IDB client would have been set to:\n\n```\n\t[0] target.exe.\n```\n\n* **!jmpto <expression>**: Expression given as argument is evaluated in the context of the current debugger's status.\n  disassembler's view is then synced with the resulting address if a matching module is registered.\n  Can be seen as a manual syncing, relocation is automatically performed, on the fly.\n  Especially useful for randomly relocated binary.\n* **!jmpraw <expression>**: Expression given as argument is evaluated in the context of the current debugger's status.\n  If an IDB is enabled then disassembler's view is synced with the resulting address. Address is not rebased\n  and there is no IDB switching.\n  Especially useful for dynamically allocated/generated code.\n* **!modmap <base> <size> <name>**: A synthetic (\"faked\") module (defined using its base address and size) is added to the debugger internal list.\n  From msdn: \"If all the modules are reloaded - for example, by calling Reload with the Module parameter set to an empty string - all synthetic modules will be discarded.\"\n  It can be used to more easily debug dynamically allocated/generated code.\n* **!modunmap <base>**: Remove a previously mapped synthetic module at base address.\n* **!modcheck <||md5>**: Use to check if current module really matches IDB's file (ex: module has been updated)\n  When called without an argument, pdb's GUID from Debug Directory is used. It can alternatively use md5,\n  but only with a local debuggee (not in remote kernel debugging).\n* **!bpcmds <||save|load|>**: **bpcmds** wrapper, save and reload **.bpcmds** (breakpoints commands list) output to current IDB.\n  Display (but not execute) saved data if called with no argument.\n  Persistent storage is achieved using IDA's netnode feature.\n* **!ks**: Debugger Markup Language (DML) enhanced output of **kv** command. Code Addresses are clickable (**!jmpto**) as well as data addresses (**dc**).\n* **!translate <base> <addr> <mod>**: Meant to be used from IDA (``Alt-F2`` shortcut), rebase an address with respect to its module's name and offset.\n\n#### Address optional argument\n\n**!cmt**, **!rcmt** and **!fcmt** commands support an optional address option: ``-a`` or ``--address``.\nAddress should be passed as an hexadecimal value. Command parsing is based on python's\n``argparse`` module. To stop line parsing use ``--``.\n\n```\n    [WinDbg]\n    0:000:x86> !cmt -a 0x430DB2 comment\n```\n\nThe address has to be a valid instruction's address.\n\n## GNU gdb (GDB) usage\n\nSync with host:\n\n```\n    gdb> sync\n    [sync] sync is now enabled with host 192.168.52.1\n    <not running>\n\n    gdb> r\n    Starting program: /bin/ls\n    [Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]\n    Using host libthread_db library \"/lib/libthread_db.so.1\".\n```\n\n### GDB plugin commands\n\nUse commands, **without \"!\" prefix**\n\n```\n    (gdb) cmd x/i $pc\n    [sync] command output: => 0x8049ca3:    push   edi\n\n    (gdb) synchelp\n    [sync] extension commands help:\n     > sync <host>\n     > syncoff\n     > cmt [-a address] <string>\n     > rcmt [-a address] <string>\n     > fcmt [-a address] <string>\n     > cmd <string>\n     > bc <on|off|>\n     > rln <address>\n     > bbt <symbol>\n     > patch <addr> <count> <size>\n     > bx /i <symbol>\n     > cc\n     > translate <base> <addr> <mod>\n```\n\n* **rln**: Get symbol from the IDB for the given address\n* **bbt**: Beautiful backtrace.

Use Plugins menu or shortcuts to enable (``Alt+s``)/disable (``Alt+u``)\n   synchronization.\n\n\n## OllyDbg2 usage\n\n1. Use Plugins menu or shortcuts to enable (``Ctrl+s``)/disable (``Ctrl+u``)\n   synchronization.\n\nDue to the beta status of OllyDbg2 API, only the following features have been implemented:\n\n- Graph sync [use ``F7``; ``F8`` for stepping]\n- Comment   [use ``CTRL+;``]\n- Label     [use ``CTRL+:``]\n\n\n## x64dbg usage\n\n1. Use Plugins menu or commands enable (\"``!sync\"``) or disable (\"``!syncoff``\") synchronization.\n\n2. Use commands\n\n```\n[sync] synchelp command!\n[sync] extension commands help:\n > !sync                          = synchronize with <host from conf> or the default value\n > !syncoff                       = stop synchronization\n > !syncmodauto <on | off>        = enable / disable idb auto switch based on module name\n > !synchelp                      = display this help\n > !cmt <string>                  = add comment at current eip in IDA\n > !rcmt <string>                 = reset comments at current eip in IDA\n > !idblist                       = display list of all IDB clients connected to the dispatcher\n > !idb <module name>             = set given module as the active idb (see !idblist)\n > !idbn <n>                      = set active idb to the n_th client. n should be a valid decimal value\n > !translate <base> <addr> <mod> = rebase an address with respect to local module's base\n```\n\nNote: using the **!translate** command from a disassembler (IDA/Ghidra,\n``Alt-F2`` shortcut), will make the disassembler window to \"jump\" to the\nspecific address (equivalent of running **disasm <rebased addr>** in x64dbg\ncommand line).\n\n\n## Python library usage\n\nOne may want to use **ret-sync** core features (position syncing with a\ndisassembler, symbol resolution) even though a full debugging environment is\nnot available or with a custom tool. To that end, a minimalist Python library\nhas been extracted.\n\nThe example below illustrates the usage of the Python library with a script\nthat walks through the output of an event based logging/tracing tool.\n\n\n```python\nfrom sync import *\n\nHOST = '127.0.0.1'\n\nMAPPINGS = [\n    [0x555555400000, 0x555555402000,  0x2000, \" /bin/tempfile\"],\n    [0x7ffff7dd3000, 0x7ffff7dfc000, 0x29000, \" /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.27.so\"],\n    [0x7ffff7ff7000, 0x7ffff7ffb000,  0x4000, \" [vvar]\"],\n    [0x7ffff7ffb000, 0x7ffff7ffc000,  0x1000, \" [vdso]\"],\n    [0x7ffffffde000, 0x7ffffffff000, 0x21000, \" [stack]\"],\n]\n\nEVENTS = [\n    [0x0000555555400e74, \"malloc\"],\n    [0x0000555555400eb3, \"open\"],\n    [0x0000555555400ee8, \"exit\"]\n]\n\nsynctool = Sync(HOST, MAPPINGS)\n\nfor e in EVENTS:\n    offset, name = e\n    synctool.invoke(offset)\n    print(\"    0x%08x - %s\" % (offset, name))\n    print(\"[>] press enter for next event\")\n    input()\n```\n\n\n# Extend\n\nWhile initially focused on dynamic analysis (debuggers), it is of-course\npossible to extend the plugins set and integrate with other tools.\n\n- Integration with **REVEN** Timeless Analysis and Debugging Platform by [Tetrane](https://www.tetrane.com/):\n  - http://blog.tetrane.com/2015/02/reven-in-your-toolkit.html\n  - https://twitter.com/tetrane/status/1374768014193799175\n- Integration with **EFI DXE Emulator** by Assaf Carlsbad ([@assaf_carlsbad](https://twitter.com/assaf_carlsbad)):\n  - https://twitter.com/assaf_carlsbad/status/1242114356881641474\n  - https://github.com/assafcarlsbad/efi_dxe_emulator\n\nOther resource(s):\n\n- \"*Combining static and dynamic binary analysis - ret-sync*\" by Jean-Christophe Delaunay\n  - https://www.synacktiv.com/ressources/bieresecu1_ret-sync_en.pdf\n\n\n# TODO\n\n- Sure.\n\n# Known Bugs/Limitations\n\n- Tested with Python 2.7/3.7, IDA 7.7 (Windows, Linux and Mac OS X), Ghidra 10.1.1, Binary Ninja 3.0.3225-dev, GNU gdb (GDB) 8.1.0 (Debian), lldb 310.2.37.\n- **THERE IS NO AUTHENTICATION/ENCRYPTION** whatsoever between the parties; you're on your own.\n- Self modifying code is out of scope.\n\nWith GDB:\n\n- it seems that stop event is not called when using 'return' command.\n- multi-threading debugging have issues with signals.\n\nWith WinDbg:\n\n- IDA's client plugin gets notified even though encountered breakpoint\n  uses a command string that makes it continue ('``g``'). This can cause major slow-down\n  if there are too much of these events. A limited fix has been implemented, the\n  best solution is still to sync off temporarily.\n- Possible race condition\n\nWith Ghidra:\n\n- Shortcuts are not working as expected in decompiler widget.\n\nWith IDA:\n\n- Graph window redrawing is quite slow for big graphs.\n- **ret-sync** shortcuts conflicts in Linux environments.\n\nConflict(s):\n\n- Logitech Updater software is known to use the same default port (9100). A solution\n  is to use a global `.sync` configuration file to define a different port.\n\n```\n[INTERFACE]\nhost=127.0.0.1\nport=9234\n```\n\n# License\n\n**ret-sync** is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
