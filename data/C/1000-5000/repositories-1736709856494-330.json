          "content": "Building DOSBox-X\n=================\n\nThe page is about manually building the DOSBox-X source code. Automated\ndevelopment (preview) builds intended for testing purposes for various\nplatforms are also available from the [DOSBox-X Development Builds](https://dosbox-x.com/devel-build.html) page.\nReleased builds are available from the [Releases](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases) page.\n\nFor instructions on installing and using DOSBox-X, please look at the\n[INSTALL](INSTALL.md) page and the [DOSBox-X Wiki](https://dosbox-x.com/wiki).\n\nGeneral information on source code compilation\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe four major operating systems and platforms of DOSBox-X are:\n\n1. Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista and XP for 32-bit and 64-bit x86/x64 and ARM\n\n2. Linux (with X11) 64-bit x86/x64, and on a Raspberry Pi 3/4/5\n\n3. macOS (Mac OS X) recent version, 64-bit Intel, ARM-based, and Universal\n\n4. DOS (MS-DOS 5.0+ or compatible)\n\nStraight Windows builds are expected to compile using the free community edition\nof Visual Studio 2017 to Visual Studio 2022 and the DirectX 2010 SDK.\n\nLinux and MinGW Windows builds are expected to compile with the GNU autotools.\n\nmacOS builds are expected to compile on the terminal using GNU autotools and\nthe LLVM/Clang compiler provided by XCode. Universal macOS builds are only\npossible when building on a host machine powered by an Apple Silicon CPU, due to\nrequiring parallel Homebrew installations running natively *and* under\nRosetta 2.\n\nIn all cases, the code requires a C++ compiler that can support the C++11\nstandard.\n\nNote that DOSBox-X supports both SDL 1.x and 2.x, and it is written to compile\nagainst the in-tree copy of the SDL 1.x (Simple Directmedia Library), or against\nthe SDL 2.x library provided by your Linux distribution.\n\nFor Visual Studio and MinGW compilation, the in-tree copy of SDL is always\nused. Note that the in-tree SDL 1.x library has been heavily modified from\nthe original SDL 1.x source code and is thus somewhat incompatible with the\nstock library.\n\nThe modifications provide additional functions needed to improve DOSBox-X\nand fix many issues with keyboard input, window management, and display\nmanagement that previously required terrible kludges within the DOSBox\nand DOSBox-X source code.\n\nIn Windows, the modifications also permit the emulation to run independent\nof the main window so that moving, resizing, or using menus does not cause\nemulation to pause.\n\nIn macOS, the modifications provide an interface to allow DOSBox-X to\nreplace and manage the macOS menu bar.\n\nPlease look at the [README.source-code-description](README.source-code-description) file for more information\nand descriptions on the source code.\n\nHow to compile the source code (cross-platform)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n* General Linux or BSD compile (SDL1)\n```\n./build-debug\nsudo make install\n```\n\n* General Linux or BSD compile (SDL2)\n```\n./build-debug-sdl2\nsudo make install\n```\n\n* macOS\n  * First install the required libraries needed.\n    ```\n     brew install autoconf automake nasm glfw glew fluid-synth libslirp pkg-config\n    ```\n  * Compile natively for the host architecture (SDL1 or SDL2)\n    ```\n    ./build-macos\n    ```\n    ```\n    ./build-macos-sdl2\n    ```\n  * _(Optional)_ Add `universal` option to build an Universal Binary on an Apple Silicon CPU (will *not* work on Intel)\n    ```\n    ./build-macos universal\n    ```\n    ```\n    ./build-macos-sdl2 universal\n    ````\n  * You can build an App Bundle from the result of this build with\n    ```\n    make dosbox-x.app\n    ```\n* MinGW compile for Windows 7 or later\n  * First install the required libraries needed.  \n    Libraries for mingw32(32-bit)\n    ```\n    pacman -S git make mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-libslirp mingw-w64-i686-libtool mingw-w64-i686-nasm autoconf automake mingw-w64-i686-ncurses\n    ```\n    Libraries for mingw64(64-bit)\n    ```\n    pacman -S git make mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-libslirp mingw-w64-x86_64-libtool mingw-w64-x86_64-nasm autoconf automake  mingw-w64-x86_64-ncurses\n    ```\n  * Compile (SDL1 or SDL2, Common for 32-bit/64-bit builds)\n    ```\n    ./build-mingw\n    ```\n    ```\n    ./build-mingw-sdl2\n    ```\n* MinGW compile (using MinGW32, not MinGW-w64: see NOTICE below) for lower-end systems including Windows XP or later (SDL1 or SDL2, 32-bit only)\n```\n./build-mingw-lowend\n```\n```\n./build-mingw-lowend-sdl2\n```\n\n* MinGW compile (using MinGW32, not MinGW-w64: see NOTICE below) on Windows to target the DOS platform (MS-DOS or compatible with HX DOS Extender, SDL1 only)\n```\n./build-mingw-hx-dos\n```\n\nNOTICE: Use the 32-bit toolchain from the original MinGW project for the lowend and HX-DOS builds, not the MinGW-w64 project.\n        Binaries compiled with MinGW-w64 have extra dependencies which are not supported by Windows XP or the HX DOS Extender.\n\n## To compile DOSBox-X in Ubuntu (tested with 20.04 and 20.10):\n\nFirst install the development tools, headers and libraries needed\n\n```\nsudo apt install automake gcc g++ make libncurses-dev nasm libsdl-net1.2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libpcap-dev libslirp-dev fluidsynth libfluidsynth-dev libavdevice58 libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavcodec-extra libavcodec-extra58 libswscale-dev libfreetype-dev libxkbfile-dev libxrandr-dev\n```\n\nThen change to the directory where you unpacked the DOSBox-X source code, and run the following commands:\n\n```\n./build-debug\nsudo make install\n```\n\nAlternatively you can also compile the SDL2 version by running the ``./build-debug-sdl2`` script.\n\n## To compile DOSBox-X in Fedora Workstation:\n\nFirst install the development tools, headers and libraries needed\n\n```\n sudo dnf group install \"C Development Tools and Libraries\"\n sudo dnf install SDL_net-devel SDL2_net-devel libxkbfile-devel ncurses-devel libpcap-devel libslirp-devel libpng-devel fluidsynth-devel freetype-devel nasm\n```\n\nIf you want to be able to record video, you will also need to install ffmpeg-devel which you can get from the optional rpmfusion-free repository.\nThen change to the directory where you unpacked the DOSBox-X source code, and run the following commands:\n\n```\n ./build-debug\n sudo make install\n```\n\nAlternatively you can also compile the SDL2 version by running the ``./build-debug-sdl2`` script.\n\n## To create a DOSBox-X RPM for use in RHEL, CentOS or Fedora:\n\nFirst ensure that your system has all the necessary development tools and libraries installed, such as by following the dnf steps in the above \"To compile DOSBox-X in Fedora Workstation\".\nThen run the following commands:\n\n```\n sudo dnf group install \"RPM Development Tools\"\n ./make-rpm.sh\n```\n\nAfter a successful compile, the RPM can be found in the releases directory.\n\n## To compile DOSBox-X in Raspberry Pi:\n\nThe official Raspberry PI website has an article including build instructions from source.  \nhttps://www.raspberrypi.com/news/read-floppy-disks-and-cd-roms-with-raspberry-pi-5-magpimonday/\n```\nsudo apt install libtool autogen autoconf automake libncurses-dev gcc g++ make libncurses-dev nasm libsdl-net1.2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libpcap-dev libslirp-dev fluidsynth libfluidsynth-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavcodec-extra libswscale-dev libfreetype-dev libxkbfile-dev libxrandr-dev \ngit clone https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x.git\ncd dosbox-x\n./build-debug\n```\nIf you have audio problems, you may want to try the SDL2 build using `./build-debug-sdl2` script.\n\nCompiling the source code using Visual Studio (Windows)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can build the source code with Visual Studio 2017, 2019, and 2022.\n(The code currently cannot be built with Visual Studio 2015)\nThe executables will work on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows Vista or higher.\n\nUse the ```./vs/dosbox-x.sln``` \"solution\" file and build the source code.\nYou will need the DirectX 2010 SDK for Direct3D9 support.\n\nBy default the targeted platform is v142 (Visual Studio 2019).\nTo build the source code on Visual Studio 2017 or 2022,\nyou may change the platform toolset to v141 or v143 respectively.\nFor Visual Studio 2017, you have to set ``WindowsTargetPlatformVersion`` to whatever\nWindows SDK version installed in your PC, for example ``10.0.22000.0``.\n(Visual Studio 2019 and beyond will pick the latest Windows SDK version installed\nif you set the value to `10.0`)\n\nTo build executables that will work on Windows XP,\nyou have to change the target platform to v141 (Visual Studio 2017).\nAfter the build is completed, you have to patch the PE header of the executable using\na tool included in the source code.\n\n```./contrib/windows/installer/PatchPE.exe path-to-your-exe-file/dosbox-x.exe```\n\nLibraries such as SDL, freetype, libpdcurses, libpng and zlib are already included,\nand as of DOSBox-X 0.83.6 support for FluidSynth MIDI Synthesizer is also included\nfor Windows builds (set ``mididevice=fluidsynth`` in the [midi] section of DOSBox-X's\nconfiguration file (dosbox-x.conf) along with required soundfont file [e.g.\n``FluidR3_GM.sf2`` or ``GeneralUser_GS.sf2``] to use it).\n\nThe slirp backend for the NE2000 network emulation is only supported by MinGW builds\nbut not Visual Studio

(maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed a segfault crash when pasting the content of clipboard is empty \r\n    or consists of invalid characters only. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed crash when trying to access MOUNTed empty physical CD/Floppy\r\n    drives. (maron2000)\r\n\r\n2025.01.01\r\n  - Fix bug that prevented the Configuration GUI from saving to dosbox.conf\r\n    the last Windows 3.1 theme you applied using the dropdown menu.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add option to apply vmemdelay to SVGA and linear framebuffer\r\n    modes (such as VESA BIOS modes), which reduces emulator performance\r\n    for those modes, but allows you to emulate slower SVGA cards.\r\n    Due to how some machine types are emulated, this option also enables\r\n    vmemdelay to affect the PC-98 linear framebuffer, Tandy & PCjr\r\n    video modes, as well as MDA/Hercules. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add workaround to CPU reset logic that allows it to work correctly\r\n    even with dynamic core. Previously, if the guest reset the system,\r\n    the emulator would crash with an error message about an uncaught\r\n    C++ exception because C++ exception handling doesn't work with\r\n    dynamically generated code. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Correct CPUID family/model/brand values for cputype=pentium_iii.\r\n    Add CPUID level 2, which returns \"processor configuration\r\n    descriptors\", and return documented Pentium III values. Apparently\r\n    Windows XP really REALLY cares about these configuration\r\n    descriptors and will hang in-kernel in an infinite loop at bootup\r\n    without these apparently really important values. This change\r\n    makes it possible to boot Windows XP with Pentium III emulation.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Allow values of memsize to represent 4GB or more of RAM. Up to\r\n    1TB, if Pentium PSE extensions are enabled, the memalias setting\r\n    is 40, and \"enable pse=pse40\" in the conf file. Memalias maximum\r\n    is now 40, instead of 32. Add code to provide that memory above\r\n    the 4GB address mark when PSE is in use by the guest OS. Added\r\n    dosbox.conf option to specify a memory file. When specified, all\r\n    guest memory is memory-mapped from a file on disk, rather than\r\n    allocated from host memory or host swap file. To avoid consuming\r\n    too much RAM on the host, a memory file is REQUIRED to emulate\r\n    memory at or above 4GB. For best performance with the memory file,\r\n    make sure the filesystem you place it on supports sparse files,\r\n    including Linux ext4 and Windows NTFS. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix EGA machine type to determine whether CGA RGBI or EGA RrGgBb\r\n    display is active by vsync polarity, instead of the length of\r\n    htotal. Several online references state that vsync is negative\r\n    for 350-line modes, including 350-line to an MDA monitor. This\r\n    also allows the \"enhanced\" EGA 320x200 modes in Rambo III to display\r\n    colors correctly. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Dynamic x86 core: Reflect STI instruction to normal core so that\r\n    the 1-instruction delay is correctly emulated. This makes it\r\n    possible to run Windows XP or Server 2003 with dynamic core and\r\n    SYSENTER/SYSEXIT emulation without random BSODs (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix default code page. Instead of assuming 437 at all times, use\r\n    437 for all IBM PC compatible modes and 932 for PC-98 emulation.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Normal core: Fix STI emulation to enforce the 1-instruction delay\r\n    by forcing the normal core to execute another instruction right\r\n    away without providing any opportunity for interrupt processing.\r\n    This does not break Peret Em Heru, Keen games, and it seems to fix\r\n    the random BSOD issues with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003\r\n    when emulating a Pentium II that supports SYSENTER/SYSEXIT. I'm\r\n    not clear on why this fix prevents them from crashing, but there\r\n    you go. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Keyboard emulation: Fix PCjr key delay to match IBM documentation\r\n    stating how long it takes to transmit one scan code, which is\r\n    obviously much slower than normal to accomodate the slow CPU and\r\n    the optical nature of the transmission. This is needed in order\r\n    for emulation to correctly send Fn+key combinations. At normal\r\n    key delay, the guest will miss scan codes and function keys will\r\n    not be reliable. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Keyboard emulation: The 83-keyboard scan codes work differently on\r\n    the PCjr keyboard because half of them are only accessible by holding\r\n    the Fn key. The keyboard only sends the base key scan code and the Fn\r\n    key scan code and the BIOS is expected to convert that to the normal\r\n    83-key scan codes expected by DOS software. The problem is some games\r\n    like \"Agent USA\" for PCjr are written to directly handle scan codes\r\n    through IRQ 1 (the fact that PCjr handles keyboard via NMI and reflects\r\n    to INT 9 is ignored here). Fix this by sending scan codes that emulate\r\n    holding Fn and pressing the appropriate key. Agent USA expects the\r\n    user to press F1 by holding Fn and pressing \"1\". (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Revise VGA doublescan mode, vs bit 7 of the Max scanline register, to\r\n    correct how VGA doublescans 200-line modes. Revise EGA/VGA text code\r\n    to divide line by 2 in rendering to match double scanned scanlines,\r\n    so that the \"graphical\" text of \"After the War\" can render properly\r\n    for machine=vgaonly. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 10: If machine=ega, check the EGA switches on INT 10h modeset.\r\n    Some games force the EGA BIOS to use CGA 200-line text modes by\r\n    modifying those bits and then setting the mode (\"After the War\").\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 10: Fix \"load font\" functions to correctly recompute video\r\n    display end for machine=vgaonly and machine=ega. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 10: Like any other 200-line 16-color graphics mode, 200-line\r\n    VGA text mode needs to program the AC and VGA palette using the\r\n    CGA RGBI-type palette, not the EGA 64-color type palette. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - CPU: Disallow clearing PE bit from LMSW by default, always.\r\n    You can still allow it through dosbox.conf. It turns out that\r\n    x86 CPUs never allowed you to clear it that way, even from the\r\n    Pentium up, even though Intel documentation beyond the 386 never\r\n    mentions it again. This fixes problems with DOS extenders and\r\n    VCPI, particularly DOS4GW which for some reason with VCPI likes\r\n    to try to clear the PE bit when switching to VM86 even though\r\n    it clearly understands it's not supposed to be able to clear it.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - VCPI: It turns out the VCPI server GDT selectors are expected to\r\n    be 32-bit, because the protected mode VCPI entry point is expected\r\n    to be called as if 32-bit far pointer. Correct VCPI entry point\r\n    to return using RETF, not IRETD, which solves crashing issues with\r\n    DOS extenders. For the first time, DOS extenders are working with\r\n    the DOSBox-X built-in implementation of VCPI and most DOS games\r\n    run fine now with it. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - VCPI: Add code to INT 2Fh handler regarding Windows startup/shutdown\r\n    messages to fill in DS:SI. If EMM386 and VCPI emulation is active\r\n    and running the DOS machine in virtual 8086 mode, give Windows the\r\n    proper callback procedure to allow Windows to switch off VCPI vm86\r\n    mode on startup and turn it back on during shutdown. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - BIOS \"POST\" screen: Change BIOS logo to PNG format. To avoid having\r\n    to render a PNG in roughly 10 different video modes, add code to\r\n    VGA draw code to allow a BIOS logo \"overlay\" to be rendered\r\n    independent of the video mode. Depending on machine type load one\r\n    of four PNG files from disk or from inside DOSBox-X itself.\r\n    PNG requirements: 224x224 or smaller, bit depth of 8bpp or less,\r\n    color palette (not grayscale), no alpha channel, and must not be\r\n    interlaced. For best compatibility, use less than 64 colors, or\r\n    perhaps just 16 colors. Much like the Windows 95 LOGO.SYS, you can\r\n    change the logo to your taste by placing specifically named PNG\r\n    files in the same directory as your dosbox.conf or current working\r\n    directory. Have fun. Note that this addition requires that you\r\n    compile DOSBox-X with libpng enabled. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to specify BIOS logo file. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to specify a text message, up to 3 lines,\r\n    at the bottom of the screen during BIOS POST screen. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix color glitches in EGA, Tandy, Hercules mode on macOS SDL2 build \r\n    (output=opengl)(maron2000)\r\n  - Add int33 mickey threshold option (Fixes Ultima Underworld) (jpernst)\r\n  - Fix configure.ac (disable-screenshot option) (maron2000) \r\n  - Fixed codepage switching when loading language file in Traditional\r\n    Chinese (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed display of some Chinese characters (Traditional Chinese)(maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed garbled text and menubar on reset (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed codepage switching when a language file was loaded (maron2000)\r\n  - sdlmain: Fixed crashing if no config files are found. (skitt)\r\n\r\n2024.12.04\r\n  - Arrange memory device allocation so that it is possible to allocate\r\n    up to about 3900MB of memory instead of 3500MB. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix S3 LFB PCI base alignment error if system memory pushes it\r\n    to a higher address (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix EGA 640x350 4-color mode (when EGA memory size is 64KB) to\r\n    display correctly. Prior to this fix, 640x350 4-color only worked\r\n    properly if the INT 10h Video Parameter Table was enabled. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix S3 VGA memory size reported through register CR36 to cap at 4MB\r\n    and set the value correctly. This fixes a known issue where setting\r\n    vmemsize to 8MB caused Windows 98 to report memory size as 2.5MB. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed a problem when VZ Editor is resident in PC-98 mode. (nanshiki).\r\n  - INT 10: SVGA mode 0x6A does not exist on plain VGA hardware. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 10: Fix mode 0x6A (800x600 4-color SVGA) to use a correct dot\r\n    clock so that the refresh rate is >= 60Hz instead of 37Hz, and make\r\n    sure mode 0x6A is a 100% clone of VESA BIOS MODE 0x102. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix MMX/SSE instruction decoding, correct some mistakes in MMX emulation. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IMGMAKE: Add -partofs option to allow control of where the partition\r\n    begins in the image (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IMGMAKE: Add -align option so that the FAT filesystem can be arranged\r\n    for more optimal I/O on devices with larger sectors, such as modern\r\n    4096-byte/sector drives. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IMGMAKE: Add -label option so that the generated FAT filesystem has the\r\n    specified volume label. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - MDA emulation: Fix non-blink attributes 0xF0 and 0xF8 to correctly render\r\n    bright green background. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed crash when a CD image was loaded to an \"empty\" drive (maron2000)\r\n  - Log loaded .conf file (maron2000)\r\n  - Supress redundant screen reports in log (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed mouse capture locking by middle button (maron2000) \r\n  - Fixed toggling the menu option \"Autolock mouse\" did nothing (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed build failure with libc++ 19 (DimitryAndric)\r\n  - Fixed fullscreen mode not responding when launched in TTF mode \r\n    in Windows (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed crashes when changing floppies mounted by drive numbers on\r\n    a booted guest OS (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed launching host programs with white spaces in path (Windows)\r\n    (maron2000)\r\n  - Convert paths from relative to absolute when launching host programs\r\n    in a mounted drive (Windows) (maron2000) \r\n  - Added an option not to pause after host program execution is \r\n    completed (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed corrupted display when loading language files at launch\r\n    (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed Z Drive path expansion to be case insensitive (maron2000)\r\n\r\n2024.10.01\r\n  - Allow the \".inst\" extension for CUE sheets. (Allofich)\r\n  - Add SET /FIRST, a DOSBox-X extension, that takes the specified\r\n    variable if it exists and moves it to the front of the environment\r\n    block. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - SET command processing has been cleaned up and streamlined.\r\n    Added /ERASE command line switch to clear the environment\r\n    block (DOSBox-X extension). (joncampbell123).\r\n  - VESA BIOS: Add new option to adjust reported linear framebuffer\r\n    address by a specific number of pixels. This is needed by\r\n    \"Out of Control\" by Contract which for whatever reason,\r\n    will always draw to the LFB base minus 128 bytes. This option\r\n    makes it possible to correct the demo graphics. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Gravis Ultrasound: Officially, registers 0x0-0xF, the voice\r\n    control registers, are documented to have a 0x0-0xF write and\r\n    0x80-0x8F read alias. Unofficially, according to the behavior\r\n    of 1997 demo \"Out of Control\" by Contract, all GUS registers\r\n    have a N and (N+0x80) alias, or at least register 0x4C, and\r\n    you can read them back from either index. Or else the demo\r\n    fails to detect the GUS. So add this alias, but only if\r\n    enabled in dosbox.conf. Real hardware testing is required to\r\n    know if the actual GUS behaves this way and which versions.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Move the INT 3 default vector to well within the initial 16\r\n    bytes of the DOS kernel, away from the List of Lists and SFT.\r\n    The previous placement caused certain versions of Windows 3.2\r\n    (yes, the Chinese version) to crash on startup. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - When using the running program to name screenshots and such,\r\n    filter out all invalid characters so that Windows users can\r\n    take snapshots even if junk characters are there (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS FAT driver: If INT 13h reports disk change, adapt floppy\r\n    disk geometry to new disk image according to media byte. This\r\n    allows DS_BLISS to present it's 720K fake floppy even if the\r\n    user initially mounted a 1.44MB floppy to drive A: (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 10 mode list: Add \"pitch\" parameter. If nonzero, the value\r\n    (in pixels) is how to program the pixels per scanline when\r\n    setting the mode.\r\n  - VESAMOED: Add -pitch option to control the pitch (pixels per\r\n    scanline). The intent is to work around DOS games that assume\r\n    nonstandard pixels per scanline by allowing the VESA BIOS mode\r\n    to use a different one. For example, Line Wars II has an S3\r\n    acceleration mode that uses 800x600, but for whatever reason,\r\n    assumes the video mode is 1024 pixels per scanline, and will\r\n    render garbled graphics if that is not the case. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - S3 emulation: Follow S3 Trio64 documentation and mask the Linear\r\n    Window Position bits according to the size of the memory. You\r\n    can only place it on a multiple of the memory size. This silences\r\n    warnings caused by Line Wars II which appears to modify only the\r\n    upper byte but not the lower when modifying this register, which\r\n    then leaves 0xA0 in the lower half. That lower half would be\r\n    ignored for 1MB or larger video memory sizes. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - S3 XGA emulation: Add XGA acceleration for 4bpp packed 16-color\r\n    SVGA modes. A CAD package has S3 support drivers that use the\r\n    16-color 4bpp packed modes and expects XGA acceleration to work.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add \"-o int13\" option to IMGMOUNT to direct the FAT driver to do\r\n    all disk I/O through INT 13h instead of directly. This is intended\r\n    for certain demoscene productions that apparently like to make\r\n    files appear out of thin air by intercepting INT 13h floppy disk\r\n    I/O and then asking MS-DOS to run something from it. Hack for\r\n    \"DS_BLISS\" demo. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed crash when a language file is loaded on a Windows host with\r\n    US keyboard (maron2000)\r\n  - Added Added sharp-bilinear Direct3D shader (RibShark)\r\n  - Pass output dimensions to Direct3D shaders (RibShark)\r\n  - Fixed BPB of floppy images made by IMGMAKE command (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed timestamp of volume label changed by LABEL command (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed pathname issues when mounting differencial VHD images (maxpat78)\r\n  - Corrected relative/absolute track offset in subchannel data for\r\n    CD-ROM images (RibShark).\r\n  - Fixed particular dead keys were not working to input characters\r\n    with diacritics (maron2000).\r\n  - Enabled \"Edit and Continue\" option for debug builds of Visual Studio\r\n    Intel builds (aybe).\r\n  - Updated libchdr to latest (treloret).\r\n  - Fixed icon in Gnome dock bar (FredBezies).\r\n  - add option \"[dos] automount drive directories\" for Windows builds,\r\n    this will mount existing drive directories from C to Y drive (aybe).\r\n  - fix off-center and off-screen window after entering the\r\n    configuration tool while using TTF output mode (aybe).\r\n  - add menu item for centering window \"Video/Center window\" (aybe).\r\n  - Fixed update-version-number script to patch all *.iss files, not \r\n    just the specific one it did before, to ensure future releases have\r\n    correct version numbers. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Updated Nuked-OPL3 code to nukeykt/Nuked-OPL3@cfedb09 (StevenSYS) \r\n  - Updated SDL2 library to 2.30.4 (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed TTF mode didn't change to graphic mode when machine = Hercules\r\n    (maron2000)\r\n  - Configuration tool: (aybe)\r\n    - more Windows 3.1 look'n'feel (themes w/ host dark mode detection)\r\n    - enhance main window layout, it is now visible in its entirety\r\n    - fix layout issues, off by one in rectangle drawing functions\r\n    - fix 'list iterators incompatible' when pressing the Tab key\r\n    - properties/help: sorted alphabetically, mouse wheel scrollable\r\n    - remove few rendundant labels, adjust names of some others\r\n    - retain 'show advanced options' state throughout session\r\n  - SVN r4483: Fix compilation in Visual Studio 2008 (Allofich)\r\n  - DOSBox Staging: Decouple CMS and OPL emulations (Allofich)\r\n  - Fixed reading NEC specific character font data.(nanshiki)\r\n\r\n2024.07.01\r\n  - Correct Hercules InColor memory emulation. Read and write planar\r\n    behavior was incorrect due to a misunderstanding of available\r\n    documentation. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Hercules/MDA and InColor integration broke the Hercules blend mode\r\n    render, fix the render so that adjacent lit pixels are brighter\r\n    again. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix \"VRD\" debugger command bug that didn't properly render out the\r\n    rest of the VGA display frame. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed debugger mapper shortcut bug where entering the debugger\r\n    completes the 1 ms \"tick\" early, effectively jumping emulator time\r\n    up to start of the next ms. This might explain the mysterious cases\r\n    where a program always fails to work unless you are debugging it.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added debugger command \"VRT\" which resumes running the guest until\r\n    vertical retrace. Added for programmers who wish to write something\r\n    to screen and then see it show up. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix IMGMOUNT, when mounting FAT disk images, to provide the DPB the\r\n    actual media id byte instead of assuming 0xF8 or 0xF0. INT AH=1Ch\r\n    should now report the proper media id byte for any floppy format,\r\n    instead of always reporting 0xF0 (1.44MB floppy). (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Allow BOOT to load and execute the boot sector of a guest OS even if\r\n    memory size is too small (in IBM PC emulation, less than 32KB of RAM).\r\n    MS-DOS 1.x of course will crash if you try that because of the\r\n    assumptions made in the boot sector, but it's there if you are feeling\r\n    adventurous or are in an experimental mood (joncampbell123).\r\n  - If memsize is 4KB, place the COMMAND.COM PSP segment in the private\r\n    UMB area instead of the normal MCB allocation chain (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS kernel will always allocate kernel memory from private UMB area\r\n    if memory size < 16KB, in order to continue to work (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS kernel will allocate from segment 0x60 instead of 0x70 if the\r\n    memory size is less than 64KB. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - files= and fcbs= default value now automatically scales according to\r\n    available conventional memory (640KB or lower) in order for memsize 64KB\r\n    or lower to free up or memory and run properly. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - dosbox.conf files= and fcbs= settings have been changed to allow\r\n    \"0\" as a value to mean choose a reasonable default. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix bug where DOS kernel crashes on startup because of the initial\r\n    stack pointer set by BIOS startup that points past available memory\r\n    when memsize is 64KB or less. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - If minimum mcb free is not set and memory size is less than 256KB,\r\n    automatically set minimum mcb free to minimum mcb segment, in order\r\n    to release more available memory within the limited space (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Do not enable XMS emulation if system memory size is 1MB or less. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - DOS drive cache: When listing a directory, defer the filename sort until\r\n    the entire list is built. This improves directory listing performance\r\n    in directories with many files. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 10h, if instructed, will now use the video parameter table to set\r\n    standard VGA modes instead of internal logic. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Removed erroneous VGA display compensation code for certain EGA/VGA\r\n    registers that really only caused incorrect display of the EGA 640x350\r\n    4-color mode. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Corrected EGA and VGA video parameter tables by copying the parameters\r\n    from actual IBM EGA VGA ROM BIOS images. They should be 100% correct\r\n    now. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Corrected register values and video rendering of machine=EGA 640x350\r\n    mode when emulating 64KB of RAM. This should fix rendering and display\r\n    issues with EGA 640x350 4-color emulation. Also corrected INT 10h\r\n    character printing functions to filter the color attribute value for\r\n    640x350 4-color mode so the DOS prompt does not have alternating\r\n    colors, in the same manner the real IBM EGA BIOS does. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix BIOS screen to use CGA 640x200 2-color mode if machine=ega with\r\n    less than 128KB of video ram, or machine=ega200, instead of showing\r\n    a garbled 640x350 display. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix memory buffer overrun with machine=ega that can occur with\r\n    640x350 mode and less than 256KB of video RAM. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - The DOSBox clipboard API (via INT 2Fh) is now disabled by default, because\r\n    some programs use it's presence to detect whether they are running under\r\n    Windows. This fixes a program where Norton Desktop 1.0 does not use it's\r\n    \"graphical\" text UI elements because it thinks it's running within a\r\n    Windows DOS box. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Remove unnecessary and useless Win32 fcntl() on some memory typecast\r\n    to int which is causing a segfault whenever a ZIP file is mounted\r\n    as a drive with an overlay filesystem atop it. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Update caption control feature to use equivalent APIs on Mac OS. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add dosbox.conf and menu option to control whether the DOSBox-X window\r\n    can be seen in screen captures in Windows 7/8/10/11. Windows 11 \"Recall\"\r\n    is very concerning and users might not want their DOS gaming to be\r\n    part of it's memory. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Correct EGA switch readback from port 3C2h to reflect a value of 0x8\r\n    instead of 0x9 when machine=ega200 (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Correct BIOS data area value that holds the \"EGA switches\" to reflect\r\n    200-line EGA \"emulation\" when machine=ega200. Value 0x08 instead of 0x09\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Correct mode parameters for CGA 640x200 2-color mode when using\r\n    machine=ega200 so that it displays correctly. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - DOS kernel: Remove fixed hacks for SFT and dynamically allocate the\r\n    second SFT table for the last N - 5 file handles. Add code to zero\r\n    SFT table memory to ensure that random data doesn't cause issues.\r\n    Windows 3.1 is still perfectly fine with it, so the SFT table update\r\n    and cleanup is complete. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS kernel: Move the magic \"CON\" strings into the first SFT and\r\n    mimic the 5 default open file handles that every DOS process starts\r\n    with: CON CON CON AUX PRN. Windows 3.1 is still happy with it, which\r\n    is good. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS kernel: Put the CON driver somewhere else because allowing it\r\n    to overlap the SFT is messy. Fix SFT generation to match the way that\r\n    MS-DOS 5.0 does it where the first table is always 5 entries and the\r\n    second table is always N - 5 entries. Cleanup the DOS memory allocation\r\n    a bit. So far, Windows 3.1 doesn't have a problem with it. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS kernel: Interrupt handler IRET was accidentally placed within\r\n    the SFT table, move it up to resolve the conflict. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Local DOS drive support: On Windows, if the guest is attempting to\r\n    create a hidden file, make sure to call the right APIs to create a\r\n    hidden file on the host. Not only is this needed to create a hidden\r\n    file, but if the guest tries to create a hidden file and the file\r\n    already exists as a hidden file, the file creation needs to succeed.\r\n    Fix for \"Facts of Life\" by Witan because the demo creates a hidden\r\n    WITAN.92 every time it is run (joncampbell123).\r\n  - XMS: Add dosbox.conf option to XMS driver to switch on flat real mode\r\n    when a) the XMS driver initializes and/or b) when the XMS driver is\r\n    called on to move/copy memory. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 21h: If a DOS program frees a memory block, and then resizes the\r\n    freed memory block, reassign ownership of that block to the program\r\n    as if allocated. This is apparently canonical MS-DOS behavior. Added\r\n    dosbox.conf option to control whether resizing a freed block silently\r\n    assigns ownership (default setting) or whether it returns an error.\r\n    DOS resize memory function for the most part DID assign ownership but\r\n    not in the case where the size of the MCB was exactly the size requested\r\n    to resize to. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Sound Blaster: Fix bug where \"force autoinit\" prevented Sound Blaster\r\n    playback from working at all, fix for \"Jump\" by Public NMI (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Debugger UI now shows PIC_FullIndex() and whether or not the CPU is\r\n    in the HLT state. Single stepping does not do anything when the CPU is\r\n    in the HLT state, so at least let the user know (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Keyboard controller (IBM PC): Cancel the IRQ signal upon reading I/O\r\n    port 60h. The reason for the IRQ, the pending data, was just read, so\r\n    now there is no point in keeping the IRQ signal up. This fixes Escape\r\n    key problems with \"Cronologia\" by Cascada that causes part 3 \"Time\"\r\n    to immediately exit and continue to the credits. Part 1 and 2 are not\r\n    affected by the pending IRQ because those parts mask IRQ 1 and poll\r\n    the keyboard controller directly. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix complexity test code to determine when Odd/Even mode is enabled\r\n    in all cases and to resolve a problem with garbled scrolling text\r\n    in the \"Vectorballs\" part of \"Unreal\" (joncampbell123).\r\n  - M_EGA display mode now applies CRTC BYTE/WORD/DWORD shift to display\r\n    start address, same as M_VGA, to ensure correct display when demos\r\n    and games set the CRTC to non-BYTE modes. This fixes page flipping\r\n    flickering during the \"Vectorballs\" part of \"Unreal\" by Future Crew.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Update Configuration GUI to use radio buttons for selection, meaning the\r\n    circular buttons that resemble those in Windows, not the check boxes.\r\n    The GUI toolkit had them all along, the Configuration GUI was using\r\n    check boxes for that for some reason. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Linux ALSA MIDI output: Any attempt to send RESET or other Fx commands\r\n    to the ALSA library causes a segfault in the ALSA library. Revise the\r\n    code to send without crashing. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Linux ALSA MIDI output: Add code to list and enumerate the MIDI sequencer\r\n    devices available so the user can use it to determine what magic numbers\r\n    to put into the midiconfig setting, especially if the user wants to send\r\n    MIDI to an external synthesizer. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Suddenly Mac OS 14 and XCode consider the \"id\" and \"int\" datatypes\r\n    different and assigning or returning one to the other is now a compiler\r\n    error. Add typecast to enable compile on latest XCode. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - INT 33 mouse emulation: Add dosbox.conf options to force a specific\r\n    coordinate system for the DOS game with respect to host/guest mouse\r\n    cursor integration (getting the DOS cursor to match the host cursor\r\n    within the window). Add dosbox.conf option where additional adjustments\r\n    are available. The maximum x/y and max-adjust options are ideal for\r\n    Lemmings 2, which uses INT 33h in a way that confuses the automatic\r\n    range detection code used to synchronize cursor position and therefore\r\n    needs this option, and the first Lemmings as well. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - PIT timer: Fix restart_counter(), the delay computation was completely\r\n    backwards. This is particularly important where it concerns programs\r\n    that use the PIT to detect the rate at which the Pentium time stamp\r\n    (RDTSC) advances as the previous code caused wildly inaccurate measurements\r\n    and bad timing (GRUB bootloader, the Microsoft CD-ROM boot \"press a key\r\n    to boot from CD\" message). (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IDE: Make sure to set feature/error register to 0x01 when the guest\r\n    soft or hard resets the IDE devices through the controller. The Linux\r\n    kernel uses a soft/hard reset on startup to detect PATA devices and\r\n    if it does not see the correct value after reset, it will either ignore\r\n    the device or complain about diagnostic failure and cautiously talk to\r\n    the primary IDE hard drive while ignoring any ATAPI CD-ROM emulation.\r\n    This allows the Linux kernel to boot and see the CD-ROM drive. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IDE: Do not clear registers unnecessarily when finishing IDENTIFY DEVICE.\r\n  - The BOOT command now supports El Torito \"no emulation\" booting from a\r\n    CD-ROM drive, which is needed to boot install CDs for Windows XP, Linux,\r\n    etc. or Linux-based live CDs. Note that at this time, BOOT only supports\r\n    \"no emulation\" and IMGMOUNT only supports \"floppy emulation\" (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 13h extensions: If a read was interrupted by an error, update the\r\n    block transfer count so the caller knows (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS: Move version parsing farther up, so that the initial DOS version\r\n    can affect memory layout and tables as needed. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - DOS DPB and FAT driver: If the DOS version is 4.0 or higher, write a\r\n    DOS 4.0+ compatible DPB structure (as DOSBox-X already has been doing\r\n    since forking from DOSBox). If the DOS version is lower than 4.0,\r\n    write an MS-DOS 3.30 compatible DPB structure. This allows Popful Mail\r\n    to run without getting into an infinite loop scanning the DPB linked list\r\n    when [dos] section ver=3 30 (MS-DOS 3.30), aside from the fact that the\r\n    game will also run without this change if you set ver=4 0 since the game\r\n    appears to be aware of the change in structure between MS-DOS 3.30 and\r\n    MS-DOS 4.0, though for whatever reason the game refuses to run on\r\n    MS-DOS 5.0 or higher. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IDE: Silently ignore SET FEATURES command 0x03. Any negative response\r\n    to feature 0x03 causes the Linux kernel to reject the IDE device.\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add support for PIT timer 0 mode 4. Linux kernel 6.1.29 compiled in\r\n    \"tickless\" mode uses mode 4 instead of mode 0 as a delay timeout. Prior\r\n    to this fix, the Linux kernel would switch into tickless mode and then\r\n    nothing would happen because IRQ 0 would never fire again. See also Linux\r\n    kernel source code, drivers/clocksource/i8253.c function pit_set_oneshot()\r\n    to see what I mean. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Windows 95 S3 driver behavior suggests that S3 16-color VESA modes\r\n    0x202 to 0x208 are NOT planar modes, but packed modes. Change modes to\r\n    M_PACKED4 and update modelist building to allow that range even if the\r\n    dosbox.conf is configured not to list 4bpp packed VESA modes. This fixes\r\n    Windows 95 S3 driver 16-color modes 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024.\r\n    Noted: Windows 95 is the last version of Windows to support 4bpp packed.\r\n           Windows 98 and higher refuses to support it and the Display settings\r\n           will not allow you to select any 16-color mode other than the stock\r\n           VGA 640x480 16-color planar mode. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add --load-seg option to BOOT in case any PC-98 game boot floppy expects\r\n    to be loaded somewhere other than the default. PC-98 game \"Private School\r\n    Adventure\" will crash if loaded to segment 0x1FC0 but runs fine if booted\r\n    with --load-seg 0x0FC0 instead. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add dosbox.conf option to direct the EMS page frame segment, in a limited\r\n    fashion, though only effective for PC-98 mode. PC-98 segment is still\r\n    0xD000 by default, but apparently there are games that require the EMS\r\n    page frame to exist at 0xC000. For these games, you can now set under the\r\n    [dos] section \"ems frame=C000\". (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Restored libslirp support for 32-bit MinGW CI builds which was temporarily\r\n    dropped in 2024.03.01 release. Also since MinGW plans to gradually phase\r\n    out 32-bit support, added code to manually build on our own. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed build errors of Windows installers. Windows Vista support for standard\r\n    installer is dropped to fix this issue. Vista users can either use the XP\r\n    installer or portable builds instead. (maron2000) \r\n  - Fixed compile error of speexdsp/fftwrap.c on gcc-14 (maron2000)\r\n  - PC-98: Fixed US keyboard support for tilde (Shift+grave) key (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed DOSBox-X freezed when codepages regarding EGA18.CPX were set (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed CUE sheets of GOG games were rejected. Still requires \"-t iso\" or \r\n    \"-t cdrom\" option for uncommon file extensions except \".CUE\". (maron2000)\r\n  - Added loongarch64 support (donmor)\r\n  - Disable FP exceptions in a portable way (xry111, donmor)\r\n  - Added \"*.ccd\" in file open dialog (maron2000)\r\n  - Added CI builds for ARM mac (maron2000)\r\n  - Bump tinyfiledialogs to ver 3.17.4 (maron2000)\r\n  - Obtain geometry info of non-standard sized floppy from BPB (maron2000)\r\n  - PC-98: Implemented int 18h ah=47h,48h,49h (nanshiki)\r\n  - Added breakpoint type \"Freeze memory\" (Enmet)\r\n  - Implemented seeking in MSCDEX\r\n    (Imported from dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#3516 authored by weirddan455)\r\n  - Fixed built-in COPY command failed to obtain free space when reported DOS \r\n    version is set to 7.1 (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed some file extensions in the filter list were ignored in the file open\r\n    dialogs (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed mounting a non-FAT VHD image (maxpat78)\r\n  - Fixed VHD geometry detection (maxpat78)\r\n  - Fixed issue that IMGSWAP command did not work for CD drives. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed loaded language file unexpectedly changes on launch. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed reported size issues in builtin DIR command (maxpat78)\r\n  - Added missing language file in Windows standard & XP installers. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed a bug in IME character display on macOS Sonoma (nanshiki)\r\n  - Fixed build errors of SDL1 code when built with gcc-14 (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed static link errors of libslirp >= 4.8.0 (maron2000)\r\n  - PC-98: Added MEM command for PC-98 mode (maron2000)\r\n\r\n2024.03.01\r\n  - If an empty CD-ROM drive is attached to IDE emulation, return \"Medium Not\r\n    Present\" instead of a read error, when asked to read. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add \"empty drive\" CD-ROM image type \"IMGMOUNT e: empty -t iso\" as a way\r\n    to emulate an empty CD-ROM drive with no disc in the drive. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add \"empty drive\" floppy image type \"IMGMOUNT 0 empty -t floppy -fs none\"\r\n    as a way to emulate a floppy drive with no disk in the drive. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Video debug overlay: Fix mouse integration misalignment when the video\r\n    debug overlay is enabled while Windows is running (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Video debug overlay: Fix segfault when enabled with 15/16bpp SVGA modes.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Video debug overlay: Fix bug where video debug failed to appear in SVGA\r\n    15/16/24/32bpp display modes because of a design where the VGA drawing\r\n    code points directly at video RAM except when drawing the hardware cursor.\r\n    One symptom was that the video debug info on the side failed to appear at\r\n    all, unless running in Windows and only within the vertical range of the\r\n    mouse cursor. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Video debug overlay: Do not bother showing the Attribute Controller palette\r\n    in 15/16/24/32bpp SVGA modes because it doesn't matter there and is not\r\n    involved with how anything is displayed. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Video debug overlay: Fix debug info text to appear for 15/16/24/32bpp SVGA\r\n    modes. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - BOOT --bios no longer triggers a system reset VM event, but instead just\r\n    jumps to the new BIOS image after DOS kernel shutdown. This is needed for\r\n    hardware and resources to stay as they were when running the BIOS i.e.\r\n    keeping any IDE devices configured within the DOS kernel intact so that the\r\n    BIOS can find and use them. Prior to this change, all hardware was fully\r\n    reset and unmapped prior to running the BIOS which made IDE emulation\r\n    unusable with BIOS images. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - BOOT --bios no longer immediately loads the new BIOS into memory, but instead\r\n    loads and stores the image to a temporary buffer. The ROM image does not\r\n    actually get mapped in until the DOS kernel and everything else has had a\r\n    chance to shut down fully. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix BOOT --bios not to try to load PC-98 ITF firmware unless actually running\r\n    in PC-98 mode (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Write PC-98 keyboard translation table (non-shifted) in ROM BIOS and set the\r\n    keyboard translation table pointer in the BIOS data area for \"Nut Berry\".\r\n    This Nut Berry game also assumes lookup and translation tables exist at\r\n    specific locations in the ROM BIOS, so put those tables there. The shift\r\n    state table in BIOS has also been added, though at the moment, the tables\r\n    are incomplete. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - MegaZeux from the MS-DOS days had a 256-color tweakmode that worked on some\r\n    popular SVGA chipsets of its time though on others it does nothing but halve\r\n    the display resolution of text mode. The basic idea is that it makes the VGA\r\n    card latch two 4-bit outputs of the VGA text mode into one 8-bit value, thus,\r\n    256 colors possible. Add support for this. However I am not sure whether this\r\n    tweakmode is supported by S3 chipsets, so it is OFF by default and you will\r\n    need to add \"enable supermegazeux tweakmode=true\" to the [video] section of\r\n    your dosbox.conf to enable it. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Undo the \"no partition offset\" change. DOOM II for PC-9821 requires it to work\r\n    else the page flipping fails and sprites and rendering flickers as you play.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Allow text layer to appear in PC-98 256-color mode. Even though I was unable\r\n    to enable it on real hardware, \"Shamat, The Holy Circlet\" requires having\r\n    the text layer visible on top of 640x400 256-color mode for the introductory\r\n    scrolling text to appear on screen. So for now, just allow it. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - The reason some PC-9821 games have been giving bad PITCH values (double the\r\n    correct value) to the GDC in 256-color mode has been determined. They read\r\n    port 9A0h to determine if the GDC is running at 5MHz or not. That port 9A0h\r\n    index was not implemented and therefore gave the game the impression it was\r\n    running at 5MHz when it was not, therefore the doubled PITCH value. This fix\r\n    corrects the squeezed 256-color mode and allows it to appear properly.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IMGMOUNT: If the file extension is HDI, assume a hard disk image even if the\r\n    image file is small enough to qualify as a floppy disk image. There is an\r\n    HDI image of PC-98 game \"D.O. Doki Doki Disk 8\" that is 2.2MB, small enough\r\n    to be mistaken as a 2.88MB IBM PC floppy disk and therefore fail to mount\r\n    as an HDI image, this change fixes it. (joncampbell123, maron2000).\r\n  - Emulate PEGC PC-98 linear framebuffer at both 0xF00000-0xF7FFFF (at 15MB\r\n    memory mark) but also make it appear at top of memory below BIOS (normally\r\n    at 0xFFF00000-0xFFF7FFFF). Some 32-bit PC-9821 CD-ROM MS-DOS games assume\r\n    the top of memory alias and will fail to show anything on screen without\r\n    it (unless, alternatively, the memalias setting is set to emulate 24 address\r\n    lines like a 386SX). Now to figure out why these same games are programming\r\n    a GDC PITCH value that's double what it should be... (joncampbell123).\r\n  - PC-98 GDC scan offset no longer pays attention to scan offset of data\r\n    partition in 256-color mode. Required to help fix broken 256-color graphics\r\n    for some PC-98 CD-ROM games. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Refuse to enable ISA 15MB-16MB memory hole if memalias is set to 24 bits or\r\n    less. Not only is it redundant to do that but it also causes the BIOS to\r\n    immediately crash on startup. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IDE ATAPI CD-ROM emulation: In PC-98 mode when emulating a NEC CD-ROM drive,\r\n    also limit sector reads to one CD-ROM sector per DRQ because the MS-DOS driver\r\n    assumes that behavior. The driver will stall and error out if it requests a\r\n    multi-sector read and the drive does NOT limit transfers to one sector at a\r\n    time per IDE data transfer. This is in line with my experience writing the\r\n    DOSLIB IDE testing program and laptops from the 1990s with IDE ATAPI CD-ROM\r\n    drives, so it's understandable. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - The reason the CD-ROM driver in PC-98 game HDI images refused to talk to our\r\n    IDE CD-ROM emulation is... (drumroll) we didn't report ourself as an NEC\r\n    CD-ROM drive when given the MMC INQUIRY command. Yes, really. The OAK CD-ROM\r\n    driver in these HDI images really does care whether or the drive is an NEC\r\n    brand drive. What a stupid reason not to talk to a CD-ROM drive. Add code to\r\n    default to \"NEC\" \"CD-ROM DRIVE\" as the INQUIRY result if running in PC-98 mode.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add basic rudimentary support for CloneCD (*.ccd *.img) images. It might not\r\n    work with more complex arrangements but it is enough for most CD-ROM PC-98\r\n    games so far. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - libpng supports the pHYs PNG chunk which describes the pixel aspect ratio of\r\n    the PNG image. libpng 1.6 has it, use it. Programs that support the information\r\n    like FFMPEG will then display the PNG image with the correct aspect ratio.\r\n    (joncampbell123). [https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues/4754]\r\n  - PC-98 mode: There is a 302KHz timer behind I/O ports 5Ch/5Eh that some MS-DOS\r\n    drivers depend on for timing, particularly a popular IDE CD-ROM device driver\r\n    in many PC-98 game HDI images. This change allows the driver to time out after\r\n    about 5-10 seconds instead of an infinite hang. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix INT 10h to keep hardware CRTC I/O port synchronized with BIOS DATA area\r\n    copy so that other parts of INT 10h called by SetVideoMode do not accidentally\r\n    talk to the wrong I/O ports.

(joncampbell123)\r\n  - DOS FAT driver: If the partition is unformatted and looks as if\r\n    freshly written by FDISK, then instead of failing to mount, mount\r\n    the partition instead as an unformatted partition and fail file\r\n    I/O until a BPB is set and the partition formatted by FORMAT.COM.\r\n    This matches MS-DOS behavior and it makes it possible to mount an\r\n    image, FDISK it, restart, FORMAT.COM the unformatted partition,\r\n    and end up with a working drive letter (just like MS-DOS). So far\r\n    verified against MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows 98 versions of FDISK,\r\n    FORMAT, SYS, and SCANDISK. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - DOS FAT driver: Add options -o sectoff and -o sectlen to make it\r\n    possible to manually specify the start and length of a partition.\r\n    Future code will use this internally as well.

(joncampbell123).\r\n  - IPX: If NE2000 and IPX are enabled, and an IPX tunneling connection is\r\n    active, and the user boots a guest OS, switch on a mode where all IPX\r\n    packets going to and coming from the guest are re-routed through the\r\n    IPX tunnel instead of to the NE2000 ethernet backend. This feature\r\n    makes it possible to play IPX-based games in a guest OS like MS-DOS\r\n    and Windows 95. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IPX: Add extension to server to allow clients to register their own\r\n    MAC address instead of using the default MAC address given by their\r\n    IP address and port number. The extension is designed so that if DOSBox-X\r\n    is a client to another DOSBox fork's IPX tunneling server, it will\r\n    be ignored and DOSBox-X will get the usual MAC address instead. This\r\n    extension is required for guest OSes to be able to use the IPX protocol\r\n    through the NE2000 card given upcoming code changes as they normally\r\n    use the network card MAC address when picking an IPX address because\r\n    the IPX interface is not available once booted into a guest OS. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IPX client: If both IPX and NE2000 emulation are enabled, IPX emulation\r\n    will use the NE2000 card's MAC address instead. It will use the IPX\r\n    server DOSBox-X extension to try. If it doesn't work, then the normal\r\n    MAC address assignment is accepted without complaint. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - NE2000: Add \"nothing\" backend. It receives nothing and send packets go\r\n    nowhere. If no other backend is available, this backend is a fallback\r\n    so that at least the NE2000 emulation can work. The other purpose of\r\n    a nothing callback is to give NE2000 something to talk to for those\r\n    who wish to use the upcoming IPX packet redirection to link DOS and\r\n    Windows games over the IPX client or server connection to other\r\n    instances of DOSBox. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added record function to capture NE2000 network traffic to a\r\n    pcap/Wireshark file in the capture directory. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed bug where guest VM reset causes the CMOS to stop ticking for\r\n    exactly the amount of time it was running before reset. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added alarm interrupt function to RTC CMOS emulation (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Reverted DOS to using the BIOS_DATA tick count for time and the cached\r\n    copy of date it keeps internally, rather than always calling INT 1Ah.\r\n    It turns out that is how DOS actually behaves, which is also why it is\r\n    possible for the DOS and CMOS RTC to diverge. Fix CMOS emulation to\r\n    allow get/set time and to run in emulation time, not real time, though\r\n    the clock starts from the host time.

The CHS or LBA partition types do matter because it\r\n    affects which version of INT 13h is used by Windows 98/ME to boot up\r\n    and, if drive C: is in compatibility mode, at all times. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - PC-98 256-color mode will also trigger the auto mode of \"render on\r\n    demand\" for performance reasons because per-scanline raster effects\r\n    are very unlikely in that case, as will MDA and Hercules machine\r\n    types. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - When the DOS IDLE API is enabled (by default), limit STI+HLT to\r\n    occur on INT 28h only once after any call to read the CON device\r\n    or call to BIOS INT 16h to read the keyboard. This fixes stalls\r\n    and sluggish input problems with programs that like to call INT 28h\r\n    often like the Pacific C compiler PPD IDE interface. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Hercules InColor machine type: Fixed attribute and RAMFONT handling\r\n    of 48K RAMFONT mode and added planar text rendering. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Write BIOS data area fields for number of rows, char height, etc.\r\n    for MCGA machine type in addition to EGA/VGA machine types because\r\n    IBM technical references suggest it's there for MCGA as well.\r\n    This also resolves an issue where with the MCGA machine type, INT 10h\r\n    failed to print any text to screen whatsoever. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Render on demand (Staging calls it \"lazy rendering\") now defaults\r\n    to \"auto\" and allows an \"auto\" setting. The auto setting will\r\n    turn it off for standard VGA modes and will turn it on for SVGA\r\n    modes where per scanline raster effects are very unlikely to\r\n    occur. This may provide a performance boost for DOS games in SVGA\r\n    modes and the Windows desktop (joncampbell123).\r\n  - CGA 320x200 4-color mode is now rendered using the M_EGA render\r\n    code for EGA/VGA machine types to better reflect real hardware.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix bug where setting doublescan=false for anything other than\r\n    the VGA machine type would break CGA graphics modes.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix video debug overlay calculations of source video mode for\r\n    CGA graphics modes. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - CGA 640x200 2-color mode and MCGA 640x480 2-color mode are no\r\n    longer rendered as M_CGA2 for EGA/VGA machine types. The reason\r\n    is that at the hardware level they are really just IBM standard\r\n    tweaked versions of the EGA/VGA 16-color modes with additional\r\n    bits for the interleave emulation and can be properly emulated\r\n    with the M_EGA renderer. M_CGA2 is still used for the CGA and\r\n    MCGA machine types for those modes. The DCGA DOS/V mode has been\r\n    carefully made into its own render mode instead of part of the\r\n    M_CGA2 case. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed refcount -1 error and abort when multiple floppies are\r\n    attached to a floppy drive and the \"Swap floppy\" mapper shortcut\r\n    is used at least once (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Hercules palette selection now provides a \"dark gray\" color\r\n    mapping to match the green, amber, or gray palette selection of\r\n    the user (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix Hercules vs MDA attribute handling of \"dark gray\" background\r\n    color when hardware blink is disabled.

Prior to this fix,\r\n    only periodic tick events were reported even if the bit was set\r\n    to enable update-ended. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix serial and AUX PS/2 mouse emulation to not send relative\r\n    motion unless mouse captured, to make it consistent with the\r\n    BIOS PS/2 mouse emulation (joncampbell123)\r\n  - FAT driver: Major performance boost is possible by eliminating\r\n    unnecessary code that re-reads the entire directory when looking\r\n    up or changing one particular directory entry. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - CMOS registers: Fix code to allow getting and setting time,\r\n    fix year vs century registers to work properly. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - BIOS INT 1Ah: Fix functions to get and set time and date\r\n    instead of faking on read and ignoring set. Use the CMOS\r\n    registers. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS INT 21h: Fix date and time functions to call the BIOS for\r\n    time instead of trying to fake it only at the DOS level. This\r\n    includes allowing INT 21h to change the date/time using the\r\n    BIOS. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS shell: Make TIME actually use INT 21h to set time instead of\r\n    directly modifying the BIOS timer tick count in the BDA.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Increased PIC event queue size, there are corner cases especially\r\n    with Windows XP that can occasionally overrun the queue.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Updated IBM PC keyboard emulation to correctly encode Pause and\r\n    Print Screen key scan codes when shift, alt, and ctrl are held\r\n    down. This makes it possible to type \"Alt+SysRq\" for programs\r\n    that expect it, including SoftICE. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - NE2000 emulation: Looking at recent Bochs source code, ne2k.cc\r\n    appears to have downgraded the \"IMR write, reserved bit set\"\r\n    message from BX_PANIC to BX_ERROR. Update the same in DOSBox-X\r\n    so that Windows 2000 no longer crashes the emulator with E_Exit()\r\n    when probing the NE2000 hardware. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 33h mouse services: Add \"Get General Driver Information\"\r\n    function for Microsoft Word 5.5 (joncampbell123).\r\n  - INT 33h mouse services: Render cursorType == 2 (graphics cursor)\r\n    as if text cursorType == 0 if the current mode is text mode.\r\n    Microsoft Word 5.5 always calls functions to set text AND graphics\r\n    cursor regardless of whether the actual mode is graphics or not.\r\n    This fix allows the cursor to show correctly as the block cursor\r\n    it wanted in text mode instead of a moving hardware blinking cursor.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed S3 XGA emulation bitmap rendering to correctly handle\r\n    8/16/32-bit pixel transfer I/O and update comments to reflect\r\n    the 32-bit byte aligned transfer mode of the Trio chipset.\r\n    This fixes incorrectly drawn radio buttons and 16x16 icons\r\n    in Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, and\r\n    Windows 2000. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed keyboard emulation so that upon the keyboard reset command\r\n    FFh, the keyboard does the reset process and THEN sends back\r\n    bytes 0xAA (power on/reset OK) and 0x00 (interface self-test).\r\n    This resolves the issue where Windows NT 3.1 pauses at startup and\r\n    does not resume booting until you press a key on the keyboard.\r\n    This also resolves the issue where Windows NT 3.5 keyboard and\r\n    mouse input stops working completely if you press a key on the\r\n    keyboard. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add Hercules InColor emulation of MDA vs CGA attribute select,\r\n    and make sure it obeys the blink setting (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Change Hercules/MDA text output to render 9 pixels per char\r\n    if the char9 setting is on, to match the 9x14 character cell\r\n    that those cards emit to the screen. The user can always turn\r\n    it back off to get the 8x14 text they're probably accustomed\r\n    to in other DOSBox forks. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Render output fixed to never double pixels vertically on render\r\n    if the machine type is emulating VGA and the Doublescan option\r\n    is enabled, in order to help resolve SVGA text mode issues\r\n    reported by ThomasKjoernes (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add InColor CRTC registers and add code to emulate the planar\r\n    bitplane operations. Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0 renders\r\n    correctly now. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Update Hercules InColor code to render the same 64-color EGA\r\n    palette as machine=ega. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Correct machine=hercules text rendering flaw that prevented\r\n    the bright attribute (bit 3/7) from working, making all text\r\n    output the same normal brightness. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add expected data structures and signatures to VGA ROM BIOS at\r\n    C000:0000 if machine type selects ATI emulation (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add ATI machine types, which at this time, is just a placeholder\r\n    for development to go in that direction over time for those\r\n    machine types. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added \"machine=hercules_plus\" and \"machine=hercules_incolor\" as\r\n    stubs to be developed on going forward to emulate the HGC+ and\r\n    InColor cards. Note that InColor will require the MCH_HERC case\r\n    to generate 64-color EGA-like output going forward even if the\r\n    documented startup state still emulates the MDA-like monochrome\r\n    attributes. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - SDL2: Stop checking for compiler flags that make it an error to\r\n    declare variables after statements in a function or any other\r\n    terrible sins that would offend old C89 standard compilers.\r\n    DOSBox-X is never going to compile for a C standard that old.\r\n    Furthermore this check is preventing compilation on ARM-based\r\n    Macbooks for some reason, though not Intel based Macbooks.\r\n\r\n2023.03.31\r\n  - \"mount -t overlay\" will now print a message on the console to\r\n    let you know if the act of mounting the overlay replaced a\r\n    previous overlay mount. Overlay mounts cannot be stacked in\r\n    DOSBox-X (and probably most DOSBox forks that support overlays)\r\n    and the user should understand that. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Remove kludges from DOS path resolution to handle drive paths\r\n    that refer to drive @ (at sign). Note that in ASCII the at sign\r\n    is one code below capital \"A\". Windows 95 FORMAT.COM due to\r\n    another issue was asking for \"@:\\WINBOOT.SYS\" and sometimes\r\n    causing a segfault in DOS path resolution due to an uninitialized\r\n    drive index. The fix for the other issue removes the need for this\r\n    kludge. In it's place a message will be logged to your log file if\r\n    anything attempts to access files on drive \"@:\" because it likely\r\n    means a failure to determine the drive index properly. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - In addition to reporting the \"boot drive\" via INT 21h AX=3305h, also\r\n    write boot drive in the \"List of Lists\" structure. Windows 95\r\n    FORMAT.COM reads the boot drive from the LoL and does not do any\r\n    error checking if that value is out of range (such as if it was\r\n    never set and the byte value is zero). Failure to set this field\r\n    will result in FORMAT.COM attempting to access \"@:\\WINBOOT.SYS\"\r\n    and \"@:\\IO.SYS\" and failing. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add dosbox.conf option to set a fixed RTDSC tick rate to use at\r\n    all times during emulation instead of the CPU cycle count\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix RDTSC to maintain a monotonic increasing count even if the\r\n    CPU cycles count changes, and better handle timestamp writes\r\n    through WRMSR (joncampbell123).\r\n  - FAT filesystem driver: Instead of searching from cluster 0 every\r\n    time a new cluster is to be allocated, keep track of the search\r\n    to help reduce slowdowns on fairly large filesystems when many\r\n    files are copied onto it (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Page Up/Down vs Roll Down/Up was in the wrong order, switch order\r\n    to correct it. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix 'pc98 force ibm keyboard layout' was always forced to be 'true'\r\n    for left & right bracket keys on US keyboards. (maron2000)  \r\n  - Fix dynamic_nodhfpu FPU stack bugs, the same bugs that once plagued\r\n    dynrec. dynamic_x86 never seemed to have the same problem because\r\n    in reality the DH FPU case was normally used, to hit this bug you\r\n    had to use core=dynamic_nodhfpu. Also fix dynamic x86 DH FPU code\r\n    never to restore from DH case if the DH FPU code was never enabled,\r\n    which periodically caused FPU state to disappear. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add dosbox.conf option to control the MSCDEX.EXE device name when\r\n    emulating a CD-ROM drive (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Wengier coded this nice text-only DOSBox-X logo for the TTF output.\r\n    Fix border alignment issues and make the text logo the default and\r\n    only option for MDA and Hercules machine types at boot.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add -print-ticks command line option, which enables code to print\r\n    both SDL_GetTicks() and emulator time once a second to the console\r\n    and the log file. This may help in tracking down bugs related to\r\n    long term laptop suspend or suspension of the process in general.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - PC-98: Ignore INT 18h AH=0Ch (enable text layer) in 256-color mode.\r\n    Real hardware doesn't seem to let you turn on the text layer in\r\n    256-color mode, though I am not certain if this is a restriction\r\n    imposed by the BIOS or by the hardware. This fixes possible cases\r\n    where Sim City 2000 in 256-color mode reveals garbage text data at\r\n    the bottom of the screen if it is there when it starts. This doesn't\r\n    fix the issue where Sim City 2000 cannot set 640x480 256-color mode\r\n    properly unless your display is already set to 31Khz hsync because that\r\n    is evidently a bug in the game, not DOSBox-X. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - PC-98 256-color mode: Fix \"Active Display Words\" value set by INT 18h\r\n    to 40, not 80, for graphics layer. This has no apparent effect on\r\n    games but it does fix the sometimes erroneous graphics layer width\r\n    in the video debug display. Neko Project II source code seems to\r\n    indicate the 31KHz hsync mode is programmed that way even if 256-color\r\n    mode. This should not break anything since the GDC doesn't let you\r\n    read back the \"SYNC\" reset parameters anyway--this isn't VGA hardware,\r\n    after all. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IPX emulation was broken because it set up the virtual file, IRQ\r\n    and interrupt handler way too early, which the BIOS startup would\r\n    then overwrite with the default BIOS IRQ handler. IPX emulation\r\n    should work now, at least multiplayer DOOM. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added debug menu and dosbox.conf option to show debug information\r\n    at the bottom of the screen when enabled. This debug information\r\n    reflects the video state at the start of active display. It can be\r\n    used to see in real time the state of the palette, display offset,\r\n    display stride, and other useful information. It is rendered into\r\n    the frame on purpose so that it appears as part of the picture\r\n    when you take a screenshot or record a video to AVI or MTS for\r\n    later review. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Dynamic core: Fix serious bug in dynrec dynamic core where calls\r\n    to handle x86 FPU instructions erroneously passed the entire\r\n    FPU status word instead of passing only the FPU stack pointer.\r\n    The result of this error was that floating point was erratic,\r\n    buggy, and often caused memory corruption in DOSBox-X eventually\r\n    leading to a crash. It should now be possible to properly run\r\n    DOS games on dynrec based systems, including ARM-based M1 Macbooks,\r\n    that use the FPU. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Debugger: When entering debugger interface, force dynamic core\r\n    to flush it's state so that the debugger can show the correct\r\n    state to the user when they use the \"FPU\" command to see it.\r\n     (joncampbell123).\r\n  - VGA emulation: Automatically ignore odd/even mode if \"Chain 4\"\r\n    mode is enabled in the sequencer (normally enabled only for\r\n    256-color mode). Some games accidentally set odd/even mode\r\n    in 256-color mode and yet apparently worked just fine on real\r\n    hardware. Without this change, such games will display distorted\r\n    graphics. It makes logical sense \"Chain 4\" would take priority\r\n    over odd/even mode. Note: If a game uses 256-color unchained mode\r\n    AND foolishly enables odd/even mode, then the resulting distorted\r\n    graphics are probably accurate to what would happen on real\r\n    hardware, but then programmers would have caught their mistake\r\n    and fixed it so that is very unlikely to occur. This helps to fix\r\n    \"Seal: Magic Eye\" although some remaining visual artifacts in the\r\n    game can only be resolved by setting machine=svga_et4000\r\n     (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Set usescancodes=true when non-US keyboards are detected\r\n     (Windows builds) (maron2000)\r\n  - For long double without using x86 FPU, the code still calls the\r\n    fstcw instruction and can enable FPU exceptions that crash the\r\n    emulator, therefore mask off all exception bits to stop that.\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added code to mouse emulation to control how often the mouse\r\n    reports events through the interrupt. Added dosbox.conf option\r\n    to allow the user to force a report rate, which can be used to\r\n    force a lower than normal report rate for games that cannot\r\n    properly handle higher ones. Allow PS/2 mouse emulation, if\r\n    rate not set by user, to control report rate. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add code to COMMAND.COM to flush keyboard input before running\r\n    the command given by the user, and flush again when the command\r\n    returns. Added option to dosbox.conf to enable/disable this\r\n    function (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix bug where Tandy mode ignored the \"allow more than 640kb\"\r\n    setting.\r\n  - Fix INT13h AH=02 broken conditional branch which prevents\r\n    installer of game \"Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb\"\r\n    to obtain free space of hard drive (maron2000)\r\n  - qcow2 image support: Make image able to be mounted by\r\n    drive letters (experimental) (maron2000)\r\n  - VHD image support: Make file name check for .vhd extension\r\n    to be case insensitive (maron2000)\r\n  - VHD image support: Fix auto-detection of geometry (maron2000)\r\n  - Sound Blaster: Added code to periodically check the user's\r\n    settings regarding recording source selection and listening.\r\n    This should allow the user to change those settings on the\r\n    fly. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Sound Blaster: Added options to control whether the generated\r\n    recording source is audible through the speakers, and what\r\n    generated audio to send to the client. Options are: silence,\r\n    hiss, and a 1KHz test tone. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Sound Blaster: If the DSP is recording rather than playing,\r\n    then send audio to the guest at the recording sample rate\r\n    containing some form of generated audio. Default is silence.\r\n    This ALSO satisfies the Creative driver CTSB16.SYS when it\r\n    does the DMA test at startup. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Sound Blaster: Fixed code to properly recognize when the\r\n    guest wants to record audio, including through SB16\r\n    commands. Prior to this fix, all SB16 Bxh-Cxh commands\r\n    were handled as if playback even if the command would\r\n    instead trigger recording. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Sound Blaster: Add missing update of \"last DMA callback\"\r\n    timestamp that is needed for when the guest pauses DMA\r\n    during playback or recording. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - VHD image support: If the VHD image is not a fixed type,\r\n    say so in the log (previously it said nothing) and say\r\n    what kind of image was mounted (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added INT 13h AH=44h Extended Verify to satisfy any disk\r\n    utilities that might use it. The function doesn't really\r\n    do anything except return success (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix CPU stack management to use CPU mode agnostic method\r\n    using mem_readw instead of real_readw. However the real\r\n    mode version is used if real or virtual 8086 mode because\r\n    of comments in an older commit that mention UNLZEXE that\r\n    depends on real mode stack pointer rollover. This fixes\r\n    a bug related to protected mode APM (Advanced Power\r\n    Management) emulation that prevented the Linux kernel\r\n    from booting (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add support for INT 2F function 1680h \"Idle\" and DOS\r\n    idle (INT 28h), add code to reduce DOSBox-X CPU load\r\n    during emulation when the idle function is called,\r\n    add dosbox.conf enable/disable (default enable) to\r\n    control this behavior (Github user \"finalpatch\")\r\n  - Graphical fixes and dialog support for Haiku OS (amol-)\r\n  - Allow jp106 keyboard layout in DOS/V mode, automatically\r\n    choose when keyboard layout is auto on Windows with\r\n    Japanese keyboard, fix jp106 input in SDL1 builds running\r\n    on Japanese Windows with English keyboard (nanshiki)\r\n  - Sync dh fpu state with normal fpu when dynamic core\r\n    calls normal core to handle self modifying code. Add\r\n    additional code to other cases. (Github user \"finalpatch\")\r\n  - Fix incorrect handling of upper 4 bits of character attributes\r\n    in video mode 72h in DOS/V mode (nanshiki)\r\n  - Fix BIOS signature at 0xFFFFF to reflect actual value\r\n    of Tandy machines so \"Ninja\" works correctly in\r\n    Tandy mode (rderooy)\r\n    See also: [https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=92129]\r\n  - Change default mixer rate to 48KHz instead of the\r\n    long standard 44.1KHz. Most modern sound cards on\r\n    modern OSes render at 48KHz anyway and resample\r\n    either in hardware or software and most configurations\r\n    render at 48KHz. Perhaps somewhat improved audio quality\r\n    could be had by rendering at what most sound cards are\r\n    doing these days anyway. As usual, audiophiles are free\r\n    to set the mixer rate to 96KHz if supported by their\r\n    sound card. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix PIT 0 timer interrupt handling not to attempt\r\n    periodic event and error adjustment unless the game\r\n    is using periodic modes 2 or 3. This fixes PIT timing\r\n    bug and possible emulator hang when exiting games\r\n    like \"Days of Thunder\" that leave PIT 0 in mode 0 or\r\n    1 on exit for some reason. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix Sound Blaster DMA rate limits to better reflect\r\n    actual hardware. SB16 limits to 45454Hz just as\r\n    Pro and earlier do. These limits were added before\r\n    the proper measurements were coded and tested on\r\n    real hardware. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix S3 cursor emulation to support both X11 and\r\n    Windows hardware mouse cursor modes available\r\n    on S3 Virge, Trio, and possibly other cards\r\n    (John Tsiombikas)\r\n  - Add EGA/VGA emulation code to keep track at runtime\r\n    whether planar features are in use. If they are not,\r\n    then handle EGA/VGA video memory access using a\r\n    simplified version for a bit of a performance boost\r\n    in response to complaints about poor VGA emulation\r\n    performance. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - VGA palette DAC update: Instead of recalculating\r\n    the palette map every time a color is written through\r\n    port 3C9h, set a flag. Defer palette map update to\r\n    when the next scan line is rendered, in order to\r\n    improve performance. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add option to enable or disable the \"memory I/O\r\n    optimization\" option, meaning the code that was\r\n    added to assign simplified VGA memory I/O handling\r\n    when the DOS game is not using any bit planar raster\r\n    op and more complicated features of the EGA/VGA\r\n    hardware. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added VGA render on demand mode to VGA emulation.\r\n    When enabled, VGA emulation does not render scanlines\r\n    until vertical retrace or when certain registers are\r\n    written that change the display (attribute controller,\r\n    VGA palette, etc.). It is added to dosbox.conf as\r\n    \"scanline render on demand\" and is false by default\r\n    because it can provide a performance boost for DOS games\r\n    but it also tends to break timing-dependent Demoscene\r\n    effects. The idea is that some emulator performance\r\n    improvement may be possible by not interrupting the\r\n    CPU loop per scanline for the same reason that DOSBox\r\n    SVN has traditionally only rendered the VGA display\r\n    in quarters instead of per scanline. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Remove experimental \"alt VGA\" rendering code. It was\r\n    never completed and it is probably starting to\r\n    bitrot (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix EGA/VGA version of CGA 4-color graphics renderer\r\n    code to consider all four bitplanes when combining\r\n    each pair into a 2-bit value. When bitplanes 2+3 are\r\n    enabled and writeable, the 4-color mode becomes a\r\n    sort of 2-plane 2 bits per pixel 16-color mode. Fix\r\n    for machine=ega and \"Leather Goddess of Phobos 2\",\r\n    a game that sets up EGA 640x200 16-color mode then\r\n    suddenly switches on the 2bpp CGA mode as a way to\r\n    do 16-color dithered graphics. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix installers for Dynamix games not working.\r\n    (Allofich & halcyon00)\r\n  - Fix crash related to swapping between disk\r\n    images. (Allofich)\r\n  - SVN r4482: Correct CMS sound pitch. (Allofich)\r\n\r\n2022.12.26\r\n  - Allow more than 640KB of conventional memory,\r\n    regardless of \"allow more than 640kb\" option, for\r\n    Tandy machine type. The setting is capped to 768KB\r\n    to reflect Tandy systems with that upgrade, which\r\n    is said to allow a full 640KB for DOS and 128KB for\r\n    video RAM without any conflict from the MCB chain.\r\n    Adjust Tandy video emulation for 768KB case. This\r\n    fixes \"Might and Magic III Isles of Terra\" crashes\r\n    in Tandy mode and Tandy graphics because the game\r\n    does not correctly handle the memory configuration\r\n    when less RAM is involved. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix code page CPI/CPX loader to allocate 128KB of\r\n    memory instead of 84KB. The code allocates a 64KB\r\n    stack for the executable code within. The 84KB\r\n    allocation permitted the initial stack pointer to\r\n    exist beyond available conventional memory if\r\n    conventional memory size was below about 156KB and\r\n    cause a crash. This is a quick fix, a long term fix\r\n    would be to instead set the initial stack pointer\r\n    to some offset below 0xFFFE based on available memory,\r\n    just as the .COM executable loader was modified to do\r\n    some time back to enable proper execution when\r\n    memsize < 64KB. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Do not load country/font information at startup\r\n    if the code page to load is the same as the default\r\n    code page. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix Tab/Shift+Tab in Configuration GUI regarding\r\n    setting text fields that have a ... button to select\r\n    from an enumeration. Those buttons are no longer a\r\n    trap for tab enumeration. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix Mac OS SDL1 keyboard support code to properly\r\n    fill in unicode character values in relation to\r\n    IME checks. This fixes a problem where it was\r\n    impossible to type anything in the configuration GUI\r\n    in SDL1 Mac OS builds. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Mark VBE mode 0x212 as \"do not list\" so that it does\r\n    not appear in normal VBE mode enumeration, while\r\n    keeping it valid for the Windows 3.1 driver which\r\n    assumes the mode is there at that number without\r\n    enumeration. By not listing the mode, drivers like\r\n    VBEMP and DOS application code will not attempt to\r\n    use it. There is already another mode number for\r\n    640x480 24bpp anyway. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix VBE mode 0x212, which is 640x480 24bpp packed\r\n    mode but with a per scanline stride of 2048 bytes\r\n    per pixel set aside for the Windows 3.1 driver and\r\n    the \"640x480 (1Meg) 16 million colors\" setting,\r\n    so that the VBE \"Get Mode Info\" call reflects the\r\n    proper per-scanline stride instead of the ideal one.\r\n    This should fix complaints about VBEMP and 640x480\r\n    24-bit color mode. Given how minimal the use of the\r\n    mode is by the Windows 3.1 driver, the 2048 byte\r\n    mode does not permit setting scan line length or\r\n    display start i.e. panning is not permitted.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix Pentium Pro emulation to support microcode\r\n    related MSRs so that Windows 98 does not crash\r\n    on startup when cputype=ppro_slow. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added SMV debugger command. This is the linear\r\n    (virtual) equivalent of the SM \"Set Memory\"\r\n    command. (joncampbell123).\r\n    (https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues/3826)\r\n  - Fix debugger help command to list both C / D commands\r\n    and the DV/DP commands. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add VGA FONTDUMP debugger command for those\r\n    who might want to take custom fonts in text\r\n    mode and do something with them outside the\r\n    emulator. \"VGA FONTDUMP\" followed by a filename\r\n    which must have the extension .BIN (for a raw\r\n    64KB dump of font RAM) or .BMP (for a formatted\r\n    dump as a monochrome bitmap file). (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Disabled code to randomly return GDC drawing\r\n    status active. The implementation was causing\r\n    severe performance issues. The code has not\r\n    been removed because it could be optimized and\r\n    fixed and could even follow the state of GDC\r\n    drawing. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - VGA 6-bit DAC mode expand to full 8-bit range,\r\n    instead of simple shifting (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix 8254 PIT emulation (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add dosbox.conf option \"cpuid string\" to allow\r\n    CPUID to return custom ID strings instead of just\r\n    \"GenuineIntel\". Have fun! (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed build to properly compile against internal\r\n    SDL/SDL2 library even if an external version is\r\n    available (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed some violations of the one definition rule.\r\n    (Jookia)\r\n  - Use pkg-config to find OpenGL (Jookia)\r\n  - Updated Flatpak SDK and dependencies (Jookia)\r\n  - PC-98 Implement AVSDRV.SYS PCM function (int D9h)\r\n    (nanshiki)\r\n  - PC-98 Support 6x8 Katakana font with int 18h ah=14h\r\n    (nanshiki)\r\n  - PC-98 Fix Audio Q-Channel info in MSCDEX (nanshiki)\r\n  - Fixed FFMPEG 5 compatibility (Jookia)\r\n  - Fix FFMPEG crash if FFMPEG fails to write header\r\n    for some reason.

(joncampbell123)\r\n\r\n2022.09.0 (0.84.3)\r\n  - Added 86PCM support for PC-98 emulation. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Added German language translation. (Link-Mario)\r\n  - Added code page 867 (compatible with Hebrew DOS\r\n    WordPerfect) and 868 (Urdu) for the guest-to-host\r\n    code page conversions. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved ANSI.SYS detection for the welcome banner\r\n    and CLS command. The command \"INTRO WELCOME\" will\r\n    re-display the welcome banner without running the\r\n    commands in AUTOEXEC.BAT. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved IME support on macOS SDL2 build. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved detection for the Chinese/Japanese/Korean\r\n    keyboard layouts on Windows platform. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved Windows installer for selecting languages\r\n    for the DOS emulator. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved config option \"file access tries\" for the\r\n    Linux and macOS platforms. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed SafeDisc 2 check for Red Alert 2 by renaming\r\n    the IDE CD-ROM device. (rderooy & psyraven)\r\n  - Fixed problem when inputting characters with call\r\n    INT21/AH=3Fh in PC-98 mode. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Fixed hang on zip-mounted drives and minor bug on\r\n    the DOS file-read code. (tbr)\r\n  - Fixed file copying problem with Windows 9x install\r\n    at the end of the DOS-based Setup. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed command like \"IF NOT EXIST D:\\NUL ...\" not\r\n    working if the drive does not exist. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed that pasting text from clipboard via mouse\r\n    may not work properly in some cases. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the mouse scrolling wheel not working with\r\n    CTMOUSE 2.1's \"CTMOUSE /O\" in guest DOS. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed window transparency setting not working in\r\n    macOS SDL1 build. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed macOS small display issue with the in-tree\r\n    SDL2 library by applying SDL updates. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed menu option \"Always on top\" to work with the\r\n    in-tree SDL2 library on macOS. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the terminal mess-up issue with -display2\r\n    option on Linux and macOS platforms. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed OpenGL output options not working in Windows\r\n    ARM32/ARM64 builds. (Wengier)\r\n\r\n2022.08.0 (0.84.2)\r\n  - Fill in PC-98 BIOS data area byte value indicating\r\n    CPU type (whether 8086, 286, 386 or higher)\r\n    (Wengier), fill it in at startup (joncampbell123).\r\n  - CHOICE now supports breaking and errors on end of\r\n    file or pipe instead of freezing DOSBox-X. (Jookia)\r\n  - Fixed debugger commands parsing numbers wrong. (Jookia)\r\n  - Fixed DIR crashing on volumes with more than\r\n    999,999,999,999 bytes of free space. (Jookia)\r\n  - Switched to year.month.patch versioning (Jookia)\r\n  - Fix NE2000 panicking if packets are queued too fast.\r\n    (kcgen, Jookia)\r\n  - Fix ISO image format detection to support pure\r\n    UDF formatted images, meaning that the image\r\n    lacks any ISO 9660 features and contains only\r\n    UDF. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added support for UDF filesystem to ISO image\r\n    handling. It is enabled by default if emulating\r\n    MS-DOS 7.10 (aka Windows 98) or higher.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added code to detect Rock Ridge according to the\r\n    System Use Sharing Protocol standard, and to\r\n    read the SUSP entries correctly for the alternate\r\n    name, if enabled. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Updated ISO MSCDEX drive emulation to scan the\r\n    available volumes in the ISO image rather than\r\n    assume the first volume, which makes Joilet\r\n    support possible if long filenames are enabled\r\n    and the DOS version is 7.0 or higher. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add IMGMOUNT -o option for ISO filesystem support\r\n    to enable/disable Joliet extensions, which is a\r\n    Microsoft extension to ISO 9660 where long names\r\n    encoded using Unicode UCS-16 exist as a supplementary\r\n    volume in the ISO image and are used by Windows 95\r\n    and higher to support long filenames on CD-ROM.\r\n    Added support for reading the Joliet volume and\r\n    providing them for both the 8.3 and long filename\r\n    APIs in DOS. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add IMGMOUNT -o option for ISO filesystem support\r\n    to enable/disable Rock Ridge long filename support.\r\n    The option is -o rr=1 to enable and -o rr=0 to\r\n    disable. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed 8.3 name generations on ISO drives with Rock\r\n    Ridge extension. The ISO drives can be refreshed\r\n    via RESCAN command like other drives. (Wengier)\r\n  - SDL_Net support is available for HX-DOS builds,\r\n    similar to other builds. Packet driver is needed\r\n    for network capability in DOS. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed line endings when copying to shared clipboard\r\n    (e.g. CLIP$) in non-Windows platforms. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed problems with SDL1 Windows builds in which\r\n    the user had to type the Fullscreen mapper shortcut\r\n    twice. It seems a SDL1 library function that is\r\n    used to indicate ignoring or adding a class of\r\n    events also liked to flush the event queue. This\r\n    is called on mode change. This caused lost\r\n    keystrokes, leaving the mapper the impression that\r\n    those keys were still held down. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed PC-98 mode MS-DOS 7/Windows 9x boot disk's\r\n    80386 CPU check. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for auto-converting non-image drives\r\n    (such as mounted local drives) to disk images, so\r\n     that they will be visible when booting into guest\r\n    systems. A config option \"convertdrivefat\" (in\r\n    [dosbox] section) is added to toggle this setting,\r\n    or you can toggle via BOOT command's -convertfat\r\n    (or -convertfatro option for read-only access) and\r\n    -noconvertfat options. There're also config options\r\n    \"convert fat free space\" (in [dosbox] section) and\r\n    \"drive z convert fat\" (in [dos] section) to control\r\n    free space (in MB; 0 means read-only) and whether\r\n    to also convert virtual drive Z:. Much of the code\r\n    is imported from DOSBox Pure, with added support\r\n    for PC-98 HDI and code page conversions. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu option \"Save to disk image\" (under drive\r\n    letter in \"Drive\" menu) to save a mounted non-FAT\r\n    drive to selected disk image (IMG/HDI). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added the \"Limit disk transfer speed\" menu group\r\n    (under \"DOS\") to toggle the hard & floppy disk data\r\n    rate function. Also moved \"Quick launch program...\"\r\n    menu from \"DOS\" menu to \"Main\" menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added code pages 856 (Hebrew) and 859 (Latin 9) for\r\n    the guest-to-host code page conversions. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option to allow create of temporary\r\n    devices for piping operations when a temporary DOS\r\n    path is not available. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for ATAPI raw sector reading with\r\n    READ CD command. (schellingb)\r\n  - Report bad sectors recorded in raw CD images as\r\n    ATAPI read errors. (schellingb)\r\n  - You can use CONFIG -set langcp=... to change the\r\n    current language along with the embedded code page,\r\n    or CHCP nnn:... to specify a language file as well,\r\n    e.g. \"CHCP 932:\" or \"CHCP 932:ja_JP\" for Japanese\r\n    code page and language file. Also improved -langcp\r\n    option for SBCS code pages, and Windows installer\r\n    will additionally set keyboard layouts for the\r\n    selected languages. (Wengier)\r\n  - Changed menu option \"Restart DOSBox-X with language\r\n    file...\" to \"Load language file...\" for loading\r\n    language files without rebooting DOSBox-X, unless\r\n    a guest system is currently running. (Wengier)\r\n  - Imported the more recent MBR code from FreeDOS to\r\n    avoid the \"boot menu\" as in older code. (Wengier)\r\n  - When changing TTF font, DOSBox-X will try to show\r\n    the number of missing characters in the new TTF\r\n    font (if any). (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed color becoming darker after changing TTF font\r\n    multiples times in TTF output. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed display of individual/total file sizes with\r\n    DIR command when they are very large. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed non-US code page conversions for mounted FAT\r\n    drives. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed incorrect message displays in Configuration\r\n    Tool and Mapper Editor when booting into guest\r\n    systems with language files. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed possible \"Path not found\" bug when switching\r\n    to code page 950 from another code page. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed creating directories may not work properly\r\n    for overlay drives on Windows systems. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed -set and -get options of CONFIG command when\r\n    there are spaces in property names, without having\r\n    to prepend the section names. For example, command\r\n    CONFIG -get \"synchronize time\" is supported just\r\n    as CONFIG -get \"dosbox synchronize time\". Similar\r\n    for -SET option when launching DOSBox-X. (Wengier)\r\n0.84.1\r\n  - Added dosbox(-x).conf option to enable workaround\r\n    for errant DOS programs that set the TF (trap flag)\r\n    and then crash. Added code to DOS kernel INT 01h\r\n    handler to clear TF flag if instructed to by the\r\n    dosbox(-x).conf setting which can prevent such\r\n    errant programs from crashing. Needed for 1996 demo\r\n    \"Dyslexia\" by Threesome. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix RETF instruction handling to only modify the\r\n    low 16 bits of ESP in real mode, even if the\r\n    immediate value for RETF is a large value like\r\n    FFFEh (fix for Finster by Mad Scientists). Prior\r\n    to this fix, it was possible to increment the\r\n    upper 32 bits of ESP from real mode using a\r\n    normal 16-bit RETF with a very large immediate\r\n    value. This fix removes the need for the ENTER\r\n    masking dosbox(-x).conf option entirely and allows\r\n    Finster to run without it. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added dosbox(-x).conf option to control whether the\r\n    ENTER instruction masks the stack pointer to 64KB\r\n    if the stack segment is 16-bit, which is off by\r\n    default because real Intel processors do not do\r\n    that. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added dosbox(-x).conf option that can instruct EGA/\r\n    VGA emulation to ignore the display blanking bit in\r\n    the sequencer registers. Some games appear to have\r\n    bugs in their VGA programming code that can\r\n    accidentally set that bit and therefore show\r\n    nothing on screen. Fix for 1996 game \"Finster\" by\r\n    Mad Scientists. The game appears to make this\r\n    programming mistake on any fork of DOSBox\r\n    including DOSBox-X, and is reported to also make\r\n    the same mistake on other emulators like 86box.\r\n    However most forks of DOSBox have a matching bug\r\n    in their VGA emulation that allows the blanked\r\n    display to appear normally regardless of that\r\n    register bit unless run with machine=vgaonly.\r\n    It's unclear if there is anything about DOSBox\r\n    or DOSBox-X emulation that causes the game to\r\n    misprogram the registers. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - If guest uses ENTER instruction from 16-bit code\r\n    with 66h (32-bit operand) prefix, and the CPU is\r\n    in real mode or the stack segment is 16-bit, mask\r\n    stack pointer with 0xFFFF. This fixes 1996 game\r\n    \"Finster\" by Mad Scientists (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now search for resource files such as\r\n    fonts and translations in the resource directory (\r\n    C:/DOSBox-X in Windows, /usr/(local/)share/dosbox-x\r\n    in Linux, and dosbox-x.app/Contents/Resources in\r\n    macOS) in addition to other locations. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated DOSBox-X's integration device to version\r\n    1.0.1, adding API calls such as DOSBox-X's version\r\n    number and platform, and some DOS-related status\r\n    such as DOS version number. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improve the HX-DOS build package, including the\r\n    TTF output support and accessory files. (Wengier)\r\n  - Use long double for internal event scheduling\r\n    if available, to improve accuracy (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix remaining SDL2 Windows problems by adding\r\n    missing break statement above window event\r\n    handler. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Move \"Always on top\" menu option from \"Video\" to\r\n    \"Main\" menu, also enabled for Windows/macOS SDL2\r\n    builds when possible. (Wengier)\r\n  - Add workarounds for SDL2 builds to avoid problems\r\n    with window resize, menu update, and restore\r\n    events that sometimes caused the emulator to hang\r\n    on startup in Windows. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add \"Set transparency...\" and \"Set text in title\r\n    bar...\" menu options under \"Video\" to change window\r\n    transparency and title bar text. (Wengier)\r\n  - Add special properties to CONFIG command including\r\n    \"system\" and \"version\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Fix DOS 8.3 filename generations when there are\r\n    special characters in the filenames. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fix creation of disk images with spaces using the\r\n    \"Create blank disk image...\" menu option. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fix IMGMAKE to provide executable code in MS-DOS\r\n    partition or floppy disk boot sector following\r\n    the BPB, that prints \"This is not a bootable disk\"\r\n    instead of leaving zeros that lead the CPU astray\r\n    and possibly hang the system in the event anything\r\n    tries to boot the partition (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix emulator segfault on invalid encoding of\r\n    BOUND instruction (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Address auto-centering on mode change complaints\r\n    by making the \"-\" setting of windowposition the\r\n    default. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added MinGW-lowend SDL2 build, which is compatible\r\n    with Windows XP. Also updated the build selection\r\n    page for Windows installers. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fix windows transparency during TTF output switch\r\n    in Windows SDL2 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fix SDL2 Windows builds to flag a resize as not\r\n    user initiated only if the presence of the menu\r\n    bar changes. This fixes a problem where SDL2\r\n    builds did not acknowledge window resize events\r\n    at all. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix FluidSynth weird sound issue in 32-bit Visual\r\n    Studio SDL2 build. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fluidsynth: Fix uninitialized conditional object\r\n    init in Windows builds (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Linux/X11: Add an X11 error handler function to\r\n    handle the occasional X11 error that can happen\r\n    within the SDL2 library if certain events, like\r\n    window resize, occur too frequently. The custom\r\n    error handler logs the error but does not abort\r\n    the emulator like the default one would.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix SDL2 builds with output=surface not to render\r\n    if the window at any point is too small. Resizing\r\n    the window below the minimum supported by the\r\n    DOS screen will not longer trigger segfaults or\r\n    assertion failures. Issue #3348. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix IME not working on Windows when -langcp option\r\n    is used to load a language with DBCS codepage, or\r\n    in 32-bit MinGW lowend SDL1 build. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed INT 10h failing to fully clear Tandy video\r\n    memory when entering 16-color graphics modes.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fixed missing/NULL INT 1Fh interrupt vector with\r\n    CGA/PCjr/Tandy machine types. DOS games that print\r\n    to screen using INT 10h in graphics modes can now\r\n    print extended (>=128) character codes correctly.\r\n    This fixes \"BushBuck: A Treasure Hunt\" and enables\r\n    it's rather odd Tandy detection routine to work\r\n    with machine=tandy. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Disney Sound Source: Fix problems between Disney\r\n    sound source and parallel port emulation. Fix the\r\n    code to enable Disney Sound System emulation either\r\n    by disney=true (DOSBox SVN compatible) or\r\n    parallel1=disney (The DOSBox-X way). (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DOS SHELL: Change shell command parsing to make\r\n    unusual combinations of command plus trailing\r\n    command possible such as ECHO. ECHO; ECHO: ECHO[\r\n    ECHO] ECHO\\ ECHO/ ECHO\" ECHO+ (issue #3503).\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - DIR command supports more sorting methods including\r\n    \"DIR /OGD\", \"DIR /OGE\", and \"DIR /OGS\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for BDF and PCF bitmap fonts for DOS/V\r\n    functions, such as the free WenQuanYi bitmap font\r\n    (bundled for displaying CJK characters). (Wengier)\r\n  - EGA: Add machine type to emulate 200-line (CGA\r\n    compatible) EGA display mode, machine=ega200.\r\n    All text modes have 8x8 character cells, use CGA\r\n    compatible video timing, and the 640x350 modes\r\n    are not available. Fix EGA display offset register\r\n    usage to properly work with alphanumeric text\r\n    mode when \"word mode\" is turned off. This fixes\r\n    IBM demonstration program \"Fantasy Land\".\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IDE: Remove extra state from IDE controller that\r\n    is managed by the drive. The ATA-1 standard seems\r\n    to say that status and drive/head registers on\r\n    read back always come from the ATA device.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IDE: If ATA device is busy, all IDE registers\r\n    return the status register and BSY bit according\r\n    to ATA-1 standard (joncampbell123).\r\n  - IDE ATAPI CD-ROM: Add ATAPI command BEh READ CD.\r\n    This command is like the 28h/A8h READ command but\r\n    specific to the CD/CD-ROM format and allows reading\r\n    the various sector types including data sectors and\r\n    CD audio. Windows NT 4.0 requires this, or else it\r\n    treats the CD-ROM drive like a non-working device.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n0.84.0\r\n  - CMOS century register now aliased to register\r\n    32h and 37h to appease Windows 2000, which assumes\r\n    the century is stored there and will complain\r\n    about invalid date/time otherwise (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Treat IDE command E7h (FLUSH CACHE) as a no-op\r\n    so that the common use of it from Windows 2000\r\n    doesn't spam your log file (joncampbell123).\r\n  - BIOS: At post, if DOS kernel was active and the\r\n    DOS Shell was still running, initiate a proper\r\n    system reset event. Some software, including the\r\n    WINNT.EXE install program for Windows NT, like to\r\n    restart the system by JMPing to the BIOS POST\r\n    entry point. Prior to this fix, doing that from a\r\n    DOS program caused instability with mounted images\r\n    and the DOS shell due to recursion. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Fix FPU implementation for aarch64 cores (cimarronm)\r\n  - Fixed INT 10h and DAC palette mapping to resolve\r\n    incorrect colors with Hercules graphics mode when\r\n    a game calls INT 10h to set video mode after setting\r\n    it up. This resolves the incorrect blue on black\r\n    color map for Grand Prix by Accolade (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Add recursive mkdir_p() directory creation so that\r\n    overlay filesystem support can correctly create\r\n    a subdirectory of any depth, instead of only one\r\n    level deep from an existing directory on disk.\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add dosbox(-x).conf option \"isapnpport\" to control\r\n    whether the ISA Plug & Play I/O port is presented\r\n    to the guest. Setting is \"true\", \"false\", or \"auto\".\r\n    \"auto\" means to enable if PnP BIOS is enabled.\r\n    Previously this port was always present even if\r\n    the PnP BIOS was not. Some operating systems,\r\n    including Windows NT/2000/XP, will enumerate ISA\r\n    Plug & Play hardware by themselves whether or not\r\n    the PnP BIOS is present. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix FPU operations using the top of stack on\r\n    32-bit VS builds (cimarronm)\r\n  - Add IDE ATAPI command MECHANISM STATUS for\r\n    Windows NT 4.0 because that system seems\r\n    to want to know if your CD-ROM drive is a\r\n    CD changer (joncampbell123)\r\n  - IDE Plug & Play resource descriptor changed to use\r\n    2-byte structure for listing IRQ resource instead of\r\n    3 bytes. This (for some reason) fixes problems with\r\n    the IDE driver in Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and\r\n    Windows XP and allows them to boot properly.\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - INT 13h extensions function 48h is supposed to\r\n    return physical geometry, not the logical geometry\r\n    normally returned by function 08h. This means for\r\n    IDE devices, to return the geometry the IDE controller\r\n    is using. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Enhanced the Mapper Editor interface. The Mapper UI\r\n    has been greatly improved. (aybe)\r\n  - Add IDE ATAPI command MECHANISM STATUS for Windows\r\n    NT 4.0 because that system seems to want to know if\r\n    your CD-ROM drive is a CD changer. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix IDE devices to start up with the drive ready\r\n    bit set for OSes that expect it when probing IDE\r\n    devices. This allows the Linux kernel to see IDE\r\n    ATA drives emulated by DOSBox-X. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix IDE ATAPI emulation to correctly handle CD\r\n    READ across one or more DRQ block transfers. Use\r\n    block size given by guest in consideration of DRQ\r\n    block size, which allows ATAPI CD-ROM emulation to\r\n    work properly with the Linux kernel. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add debug command to show PC-98 color palettes.\r\n    Corrected typo. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add support for PC-98 monochrome graphics mode.\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - IDE emulation now handles implementation events per\r\n    IDE device instead of per IDE controller, which\r\n    may resolve IDE controller issues with some guests.\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added PC-98 GDC drawing commands, which is\r\n    based on Neko Project II source code (nanshiki)\r\n  - Added PC-98 LIO BIOS interface, which is based on\r\n    Neko Project II source code (nanshiki)\r\n  - INT 21h AH=31h Terminate And Stay Resident: If the\r\n    program called INT 21h to free its own PSP segment,\r\n    reassign the block back to the program as allocated\r\n    and then resize as expected. Needed for PC-98 game\r\n    \"Yu No\" in which PLAY6.EXE, one of the resident\r\n    drivers used for music, does just that. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add a hack to enable read access to port 0xa460 on PC-98 which \r\n    returns Sound ID to detect the sound board available.\r\n    Note that the current hack returns Sound ID of PC-9801-86 board\r\n    regardless of the board selected to emulate. (maron2000)\r\n  - Adds WINCHECK to list of programs which should not\r\n    return a valid installation check for WinOldAp\r\n    (AX=1700h/int2fh) so it doesn't mistakenly believe\r\n    Windows is running (cimarronm)\r\n  - Add minimal support for IDE SET FEATURES command EFh.\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix CMPXCHG8B to change only the ZF flag, instead of\r\n    changing ZF with other flags in an undefined state\r\n    afterwards. This fixes problems with the Windows 2000\r\n    kernel booting up and cputype=pentium (though I am\r\n    unable to get past the INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE error).\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Updates XADD instruction to set appropriate flags\r\n    (cimarronm)\r\n  - Updates to FPU to handle opcode size prefix (66h)\r\n    on FSTENV/FLDENV/FSAVE/FRSTOR instructions (cimarronm)\r\n  - Update FLD constant FPU instructions to more\r\n    accurately match FPU implementations (cimarronm)\r\n  - Fixed dynamic_dynrec being displayed as dynamic_x86\r\n    in menu, and PREFETCH instruction breakage in the\r\n    dynamic core. (Jookia)\r\n  - Fixed crash if no dynamic cores available (Jookia)\r\n  - Fixed TTF mode breaking a guest not running the\r\n    DOS kernel. (Jookia)\r\n  - Fix DBCS table initialization on reset and\r\n    restart (cimarronm)\r\n  - Fixed some guest systems may not work as expected\r\n    in non-TTF outputs. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed IME input not working in MinGW builds, and\r\n    FluidSynth in MinGW-lowend builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed resizable OpenGL Voodoo window not working\r\n    properly on Windows in previous version. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed commands \"CHOICE /N /C:123\" and \"MIXER /GUI\"\r\n    not working properly in previous version. (Wengier)\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Disable leading directory validity check in\r\n    DOS_FindDevice.\r\n0.83.25\r\n  - XGA: Do not register XGA I/O ports unless emulating\r\n    S3 chipset (such as machine=svga_s3) (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Menu options \"Force scaler\" and \"Print text screen\"\r\n    can now be assigned to keyboard shortcuts from the\r\n    Mapper Editor. (Wengier)\r\n  - Allowed to boot from Toshiba DOS image file for the\r\n    Toshiba J-3100 emulation. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Default S3 machine types now support XGA/SXGA VText\r\n    in DOS/V, in addition to svga_et4000. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Added \"j3100backcolor\" and \"j300textcolor\" config\r\n    options (in [dosv] section) to specify background\r\n    and text colors in J-3100 mode. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Added config option \"aspect_ratio\" (in [render]\r\n    section) which when set will force the specified\r\n    aspect ratio (e.g. 16:9 or 3:2) in the aspect ratio\r\n    correction mode (i.e. aspect=true). A menu group\r\n    \"Aspect ratio\" is added to \"Video\" menu for users\r\n    to select or set an aspect ratio, including an\r\n    original ratio option. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"show recorded filename\" (in\r\n    [dosbox] section) which when set to true (default)\r\n    will show message boxes with recorded filenames\r\n    when making audio or video captures. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"allow quit after warning\" (in\r\n    [dosbox] section) which when set to false DOSBox-X\r\n    will disallow the quit option after displaying a\r\n    warning message. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"turbo last second\" (in [cpu]\r\n    section) which allows to stop the Turbo function\r\n    after specified number of seconds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated FLAC, MP3, and WAV decoder libraries to the\r\n    latest versions (v0.12.38, v0.6.32, and v0.13.6)\r\n    respectively; per David Reid). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for upper case characters (A-Z) for\r\n    AUTOTYPE command. (kcgen)\r\n  - Added /T option for CHOICE command to set a default\r\n    choice as in DOS, e.g. CHOICE /T:Y,3 (Wengier)\r\n  - Added Korean language option in Windows installer.\r\n    Also, language option page will be shown regardless\r\n    of the output option selected. (Wengier)\r\n  - Add stub INT 10h handler at F000:F065 if\r\n    machine=vgaonly and using a VGA ROM BIOS image.\r\n    The IBM VGA ROM BIOS image points INT 42h at that\r\n    fixed address and calls it for any function it does\r\n    not understand. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Set int33 event status bit 8 when passing absolute\r\n    mouse coordinates, which is useful in emulation or\r\n    virtualization environments where the mouse may be\r\n    integrated with the host cursor. (javispedro)\r\n  - Added support for Pentium Pro hinting NOPs and\r\n    related multi-byte NOPs. (Jookia)\r\n  - Updated HX DOS Extender to latest version 2.19 for\r\n    HX-DOS builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X returns 1 instead of 0 when E_Exit occurs\r\n    or unit tests fail. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed built-in IPX and Modem emulation unavailable\r\n    in MinGW builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed -machine command-line option (as listed by\r\n    \"INTRO USAGE\" command) not working. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed lockup in classic Jumpman. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed color in some modes under x86-64 macOS SDL2\r\n    builds. (myon98)\r\n  - Fixed extra INT 10h call during BIOS screen. The\r\n    extra call caused crashes when combined with a ROM\r\n    image of the stock IBM VGA BIOS. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed fscale FPU operation and updated FPU status\r\n    word. Also fixed FPU stack value log messages on\r\n    x86-based builds. (cimarronm)\r\n  - Fixed bug that OpenGL Voodoo window may not appear\r\n    correctly if the DOSBox-X window was previously in\r\n    full-screen mode in some builds. DOSBox-X will now\r\n    ensure a switch to window mode (or maximized window\r\n    mode) in this case. Also fixed some menu options\r\n    including rebooting DOSBox-X while Voodoo emulation\r\n    is currently active. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed crash when switching to dynamic_rec core from\r\n    menu when dynamic_x86 is also available. Also fixed\r\n    the dynamic_rec core may not be displayed correctly\r\n    in the menu when a language file is used. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed Windows resource information. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed a buffer overflow when launching a program.\r\n    (Jookia)\r\n  - Fixed bug where DOS IOCTL would call device control\r\n    channel on devices which did not advertise support\r\n    for IOCTL. (cimarronm)\r\n  - Clean up of DOS device and attribute flag usage\r\n    (cimarronm)\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Use real pointer with font data for reading\r\n    characters. Also ignore page number for modes with\r\n    only one page.\r\n0.83.24\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.24.html\r\n  - PC-98: Search for FONT.ROM in resources directory\r\n    in addition to the working directory. (bsdf)\r\n  - Add S3 Vision964 and Vision968, based on existing\r\n    support for the Vision864/868 chips (rderooy).\r\n  - APM BIOS: When the guest calls the APM BIOS to go\r\n    into suspend or standby mode, emulate a suspended\r\n    or standby mode. Spacebar resumes the guest machine.\r\n    Blank the display (if VGA/SVGA machine type) upon\r\n    suspend/standby and unblank upon leaving it.\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - APM BIOS: Add dosbox-x.conf option to control\r\n    whether the power button triggers a suspend or\r\n    standby event. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - APM BIOS: Add power button mapper event, tie\r\n    power button to APM BIOS, return power button as\r\n    APM suspend event, add code to APM BIOS to handle\r\n    suspend and resume events. Windows 98 no longer\r\n    complains about the inability to suspend or go to\r\n    standby. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - APM BIOS: Limit debug logging of APM BIOS function\r\n    AH=05h (CPU IDLE) because Windows 98 likes to call\r\n    that function way too often. Once a millisecond, in\r\n    fact! The log spam makes it difficult to see\r\n    anything important scroll by while debugging.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Revise S3 Trio64 XGA line drawing code to\r\n    add comments, and obey the \"skip last pixel\" bit\r\n    so that the Windows drivers can better draw polygon\r\n    line segments. This fixes broken XOR polylines in\r\n    Windows 3.1 and Microsoft Word 2.0. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add S3 ViRGE accelerated XGA line drawing function.\r\n    Windows 3.1 through Windows 98 can now draw lines\r\n    with hardware acceleration. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Merge code to help preserve long filename when\r\n    older program writes/overwrites the 8.3 filename.\r\n  - Change \"fpu\" config setting to an enumeration\r\n    that still accepts true and false, but now also\r\n    accepts auto, 287, and 387. It is now possible to\r\n    specify fpu=287 and cputype=386 to emulate a 386\r\n    paired with a 287 chip as is said to be how early\r\n    386 Compaq systems were wired, for example.\r\n    (joncampbell123)\r\n  - 3Dfx Voodoo window is now resizable (inc. maximized\r\n    window) when using OpenGL mode, in addition to the\r\n    software mode. (MartyShepard, kekko, Wengier)\r\n  - Menu options \"CJK: Switch between DBCS/SBCS modes\",\r\n    CJK: Auto-detect box-drawing characters\", and \"Reset\r\n    color scheme\" (in \"Video\" -> \"TTF options\") are now\r\n    assignable in Mapper Editor. (Wengier)\r\n  - The \"colors\" config setting now allows a leading\r\n    \"+\" character to stay the specified color scheme when\r\n    switching from another output. (Wengier)\r\n  - SETCOLOR command allows a syntax like \"SETCOLOR 1 +\"\r\n    to return the specified color number to the preset\r\n    value (as specified by \"colors\" setting). (Wengier)\r\n  - When using TTF output, DOSBox-X will dim the topmost\r\n    line when the window is inactive in full-screen or\r\n    menuless mode as in vDosPlus. (emendelson)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT command now accepts wildcards, such as\r\n    \"IMGMOUNT A disk*.img\" to mount image files matching\r\n    the given pattern. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added CuteMouse wheel mouse extension so that DOS\r\n    programs such as DOS Navigator 2 can make use of it.\r\n    It is enabled when mouse wheel movement conversion is\r\n    currently disabled. (FeralChild & Wengier)\r\n  - Implemented basic support for VMware mouse protocol\r\n    so that when used together with e.g. the VMware mouse\r\n    driver for Windows 3.x, the mouse will be seamlessly\r\n    integrated with the host system, and can enter/exit\r\n    the DOSBox-X window without having to capture/release\r\n    the mouse. Config option \"vmware\" is added (in [dos]\r\n    section) which allows to disable VMware mouse guest\r\n    integration. (FeralChild, Wengier, joncampbell123)\r\n  - When country number is not specified and cannot be\r\n    obtained from system, DOSBox-X will try to map the\r\n    keyboard layout to country number. The country list\r\n    is also extended. (Wengier & FeralChild)\r\n  - Added \"-nolog\" command-line option to disable logging\r\n    output completely, and \"Disable logging output\" menu\r\n    option in \"Debug\" menu to toggle this. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated EGA?.CPX and KEYBOARD.SYS/KEYBRD?.SYS to the\r\n    latest version from FreeDOS. The CPX files now appear\r\n    in CPI directory of Z drive, which can be replaced by\r\n    files provided by the user. (FeralChild & Wengier)\r\n  - Fix lockup when printing in dBase IV. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fix crash/restart when running Wing Commander with\r\n    EMS memory enabled. (grapeli)\r\n  - Fix possible buffer overflow issue that may happen\r\n    in certain conditions. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fix NewWadTool 1.3 unable to play music by ensuring\r\n    that periodic timer interrupt is triggered on every\r\n    cmos_timerevent. (cimarronm)\r\n  - Fix handling of some DOS file I/O device drivers that\r\n    expect a pre-filled input-buffer on READ function and\r\n    also do not like to be called for every single byte\r\n    in that buffer may not work correctly. (leecher1337)\r\n  - Fix FPU emulation to use 8087 FENI/FDISI behavior\r\n    when cputype=8086 or cputype=80186. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix FPU emulation to correctly emulate 80287 -/+inf\r\n    compare behavior even if compiled for x86 targets\r\n    where C_FPU_X86 uses the host FPU. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix audio speech stuttering issue in SpaceQuest 4\r\n    v1.3 using Sound Blaster. (grapeli & rderooy)\r\n  - Fix issue with Lemmings palette swapping not working\r\n    properly. (maron2000 & grapeli)\r\n  - Updated MT32emu to version 2.6.1. (maron2000)\r\n    (Refer to https://github.com/munt/munt for details)\r\n  - Updated DOSMID to version 0.9.6. (Wengier)\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Indicate in BIOS memory when keyboard ACK received.\r\n    Fixes Soko-ban Revenge.\r\n    - Fix execution of small COM programs on PCjr machine\r\n    type.\r\n0.83.23\r\n  - Fixed XGA accelerated rendering for ViRGE emulation\r\n    and 24 bits/pixel display modes. Since Windows drivers\r\n    insist on 24bpp, this is necessary for\r\n    \"Truecolor (24-bit)\" to display and render correctly.\r\n  - dosbox-x.conf option \"vesa vbe 1.2 modes are 32bpp\" is\r\n    now \"true\", \"false\" or \"auto\", where \"auto\" determines\r\n    this setting based on which S3 chipset is being\r\n    emulated. It seems the Windows drivers for ViRGE\r\n    chipsets require 24bpp for truecolor modes, in fact,\r\n    they do not even offer 32bpp as an option. Since\r\n    the Windows 3.1/95/98 drivers use VESA BIOS calls to\r\n    set video modes, this implies that the VESA BIOS on\r\n    ViRGE cards are also making the base modes 24bpp rather\r\n    than 32bpp. Note that the Windows drivers for older S3\r\n    chipsets are perfectly happy to use 32bpp unless you\r\n    select \"16.7 million colors (1 Meg)\" in Windows 3.1,\r\n    which is the only option in those drivers to offer\r\n    24bpp. To avoid grief with DOSBox-X users, \"auto\"\r\n    is the default setting.\r\n  - Added basic S3 ViRGE XGA acceleration. It's enough for\r\n    90% of the GDI functions in Windows 3.1 so far.\r\n  - Fixed S3 rectangle XGA accelerated pattern blit, when\r\n    using display memory as the pattern mask source, to\r\n    follow S3 Trio32/Trio64 documentation, instead of the\r\n    DOSBox SVN educated guess, to resolve some edge cases\r\n    where the wrong color is chosen to draw filled rectangles\r\n    in Windows 3.1. This fixes the \"basement\" in Microsoft\r\n    Creative Writer so that clicking around no longer leaves\r\n    white boxes on the screen.\r\n  - Extend 256-color foreground/background color behavior\r\n    from S3 86c928 to Vision864 and Vision868 as Windows\r\n    95 behavior suggests they handle the hardware cursor\r\n    the same way in 256-color mode.\r\n  - Extend \"divide cursor X position by bytes per pixel\"\r\n    behavior from S3 86c928 to Vision864 and Vision868\r\n    emulation as well, based on Windows 3.1 video driver\r\n    behavior.\r\n  - Gravis Ultrasound: Most I/O registers except port 3x4\r\n    are intended for 8-bit I/O. If 16-bit I/O occurs to\r\n    such registers, handle as two 8-bit I/O cycles. I\r\n    found something in the Demoscene (1997 demo \"Atlantis,\r\n    Deep Like A Sea\") that uses a 16-bit I/O write to write\r\n    current channel and register select in one write.\r\n    Prior to this fix, there was no music other than quiet\r\n    popping noises in DOSBox-X.\r\n  - Sound Blaster: Fixed DSP command 0x48 (Set DSP block\r\n    transfer size) to accept block size as BYTES as\r\n    standardized by Creative and convert to SAMPLES\r\n    internally. This fixes stuttering voices in Freddy\r\n    Pharkas when sbtype=sb16. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Avoid crashes due to assertion failure when media \r\n    keys are pressed (maron2000)\r\n  - Fix CD audio playback failure (cue + mp3) when\r\n    trying to play from pregap sectors. (maron2000)\r\n  - Change default value of mt32.rate to 48kHz to match\r\n    default value of mt32.analog option. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fix a buffer overflow issue in dos.cpp (maron2000)\r\n0.83.22\r\n  - Added Pentium 3 Processor Serial Number emulation.\r\n    Serial number can be set from dosbox-x.conf or not\r\n    set, in which case it will act as if disabled by the\r\n    BIOS. (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added Pentium III cputype, added SSE register set,\r\n    added SSE instructions to debugger disassembler,\r\n    added some initial SSE instructions. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added some MSRs expected by Linux, Windows, and\r\n    tools like CPU-Z to make them happy. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added FXSAVE/FXRSTOR which makes Linux happy with\r\n    Pentium III emulation. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Allow WRMSR to set time stamp counter, as it is known\r\n    though undocumented a standard since the Pentium\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added debugger command to show global and per-voice\r\n    status of the Gravis Ultrasound emulation. May come\r\n    in handy for programmers who wish to write their own\r\n    GUS routines, and for Trixter who brought up the\r\n    subject of determining whether a program plays music\r\n    with the GUS or treats it like a dumb sound card.\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added debugger command to show SSE register file, and\r\n    to set SSE register contents. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added debugger command to show MMX register file, and\r\n    to set MMX register contents. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added support for expressions within parenthesis in\r\n    debugger expression handling. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added & (AND), ^ (XOR), and | (OR) operators, and\r\n    << and >> bit shift operators to debugger expression\r\n    handling. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added multiply (*) and divide (/) operators to debugger\r\n    expression handling. Order of operations applies, so\r\n    given mixed addition and multiplication, the multiply\r\n    is done first then the result is added. Also added\r\n    support for the modulo (%) operator to the debugger\r\n    expression handling. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Revised debugger expression handling to correctly\r\n    parse arithmetic operators with order of operations\r\n    in mind. Prior to this fix, consecutive subtraction\r\n    would cause seemingly illogical results, for example\r\n    \"10-1-1-1\" would yield \"9\" instead of \"7\" because\r\n    subtraction was handled in the wrong order. This fix\r\n    also makes mixed addition and subtraction possible.\r\n    NOTICE: Remember that all numbers going in and\r\n    coming out of the expression handler are hexadecimal,\r\n    NOT decimal! (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed simple expression handling in the debugger.\r\n    Revised hexadecimal vs register parsing so that\r\n    hexadecimal numbers that happen to start with\r\n    the name of certain CPU flag registers does not\r\n    cause confusing results. Prior to this fix,\r\n    hexadecimal numbers like \"dfe\" or \"af0\" were\r\n    impossible to enter without leading zeros or\r\n    quotes because the parser would confuse the\r\n    first digits with the DF and AF bits of the FLAGS\r\n    register. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added menu options \"AMD Athlon 600MHz\" and \"Pentium\r\n    III 866MHz EB\" within the group \"Emulate CPU speed\"\r\n    (under \"CPU\") for CPU speeds to emulate. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for archive, hidden, system attributes\r\n    on mounted local and overlay drives for non-Windows\r\n    platforms by using special file(s). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"special operation file prefix\"\r\n    (in [dos] section) to specify an alternative file\r\n    prefix for DOSBox-X's special operations on mounted\r\n    local and overlay drives. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added code page 3021 for the MIK character set used\r\n    by the Bulgarian language (as in FreeDOS). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added language file for the Brazilian Portuguese,\r\n    available from Windows installer. (altiereslima)\r\n  - For piping (|), DOSBox-X will now also try C: drive\r\n    as a temporary piping path if current directory is\r\n    read-only and the environment variable %TEMP% (or\r\n    %TMP%) is not set. (Wengier)\r\n  - For clipboard copy, CR+LF will now be used instead\r\n    of LF on Windows for better compatibility. (Wengier)\r\n  - Disk images are automatically mounted as read-only\r\n    (instead of failing) now if the image files are\r\n    read-only and the users do not explicitly specify\r\n    read-only mode for the disk images. (Wengier)\r\n  - The default value of config option \"autofixwarning\"\r\n    (in [dos] section) is now \"false\", and it is now\r\n    changeable via CONFIG command. (Wengier)\r\n  - The default output for Linux SDL1 builds is changed\r\n    from opengl to surface, unlike Linux SDL2 builds\r\n    whose default output remains opengl. (Wengier)\r\n  - Native Windows menus is supported in Windows SDL2\r\n    builds just like Windows SDL1 builds. It is possible\r\n    to force SDL-drawn menus for both Windows SDL1 and\r\n    SDL2 builds at compile time. (Wengier)\r\n  - Setting \"windowposition\" to \"-\" in the configuration\r\n    will leave DOSBox-X window position as is instead of\r\n    a specific position or being centered. (Wengier)\r\n  - For printing, the SarasaGothicFixed TTF font will\r\n    also be searched for DBCS code pages. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"showdbcsnodosv\" (in the [dosv]\r\n    section) which when set to true enables rendering of\r\n    Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters for DBCS code\r\n    pages in non-DOS/V, non-PC98, and non-TTF mode.\r\n    Video capturing started from TTF output will enable\r\n    DBCS characters when possible. (Wengier)\r\n  - Changing DBCS code pages is supported for standard\r\n    modes (i.e. non-DOS/V, non-PC98 and non-TTF modes)\r\n    using CHCP command. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed issues with certain DBCS characters for the\r\n    DOS/V system. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed slow blinking text in TTF output. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed copying box drawing characters to clipboard\r\n    not working in non-TTF JEGA mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed background for the Configuration Tool when\r\n    the TTF output is active. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed DBCS characters not showing up when capturing\r\n    screenshots in TTF CJK mode, or they do not show up\r\n    properly in the Configuration Tool when \"autodbcs\"\r\n    is set to \"false\" in the configuration. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed media keys presses by ignoring these keys in\r\n    Windows SDL1 builds. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed IOCTL & ASPI interfaces for mounting physical\r\n    CD drives on the Windows platform. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the issue of loading scalers in the previous\r\n    version. A message box will only show up if you\r\n    append \"prompt\" to the scaler option. (Wengier)\r\n0.83.21\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.21.html\r\n  - Improved clipboard copying & pasting for different\r\n    code pages including box-drawing characters in DBCS\r\n    code pages. Also, for the J-3100 mode, the selected\r\n    text will now be highlighted when you try to select\r\n    text for copying. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved IME support for Chinese/Japanese/Korean\r\n    languages on Windows builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Pausing the emulation will automatically release\r\n    the mouse and prevent mouse capture. (Wengier)\r\n  - For Configuration Tool, a \"...\" button is added to\r\n    properties which have limited numbers of values so\r\n    that when clicking their possible values will be\r\n    shown in a new dialog and can be selected directly.\r\n    Also, more settings will be applied immediately when\r\n    modified from the Configuration Tool. (Wengier)\r\n  - For Windows SDL1 builds, DOSBox-X will now try to\r\n    prevent the Windows menus from separating into more\r\n    than one lines due to small window width. (Wengier)\r\n  - If a scaler as specified in the config may not work\r\n    as expected and if not forced, DOSBox-X will show a\r\n    a message box asking whether to load it. (Wengier)\r\n  - Config option \"pixelshader\" now allows a shader file\r\n    name without the .fx extension, or a shader file in\r\n    the current directory. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for ENET reliable UDP as an option for\r\n    modem and null-modem emulation. You can enable it\r\n    with \"sock:1\" option for modems/null-modems that are\r\n    connected with serial ports (COM1-COM9), such as\r\n    \"serial1=modem listenport:5000 sock:1\" for COM1 to\r\n    listen to port 5000 with reliable ENET UDP instead\r\n    of TCP connection. The feature is ported from DOSBox\r\n    Staging. (sduensin, GranMinigun, kcgen, Wengier)\r\n  - Added new command-line option \"-o\" for providing\r\n    command-line option(s) if programs(s) are specified\r\n    to start when you launch DOSBox-X. An example:\r\n    dosbox-x program.exe -o \"opt1 opt2\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Added special properties to CONFIG command including\r\n    \"cd\", \"date\", \"errorlevel\", \"random\", \"time\", and\r\n    \"lastmount\" so that commands like \"CONFIG -GET cd\"\r\n    and \"CONFIG -GET errorlevel\" will get current DOS\r\n    directory and ERRORLEVEL value. The returned value\r\n    will also be saved to %CONFIG% variable. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Enter Debugger Command\" button to \"DOSBox-X\r\n    logging output\" and \"Code overview\" windows (from\r\n    \"Debug\" menu\") for users to enter some debugger\r\n    command(s) and see the result. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added debugger commands DATE and TIME to view or\r\n    change DOSBox-X's internal date and time, using the\r\n    same date and time formats as the shell DATE and\r\n    TIME commands, e.g. \"TIME 10:11:12\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"badcommandhandler\" (in [dos]\r\n    section) which allows to specify a custom error\r\n    handler program before error message \"Bad command\r\n    or file name\" shows up in the DOS shell. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"stop turbo on key\" (in [cpu]\r\n    section) which allows to automatically stop the\r\n    Turbo (fast forward) mode when a keyboard input\r\n    has been detected. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"fat32setversion\" (in [dos]\r\n    section) which controls whether DOSBox-X should\r\n    automatically set reported DOS version to 7.0/7.10\r\n    when it's less than 7.0/7.10 and mounting LBA/FAT32\r\n    disk images is requested. It defaults to \"ask\" so\r\n    that DOSBox-X will ask in this case. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"j3100colorscroll\" (in [dosv]\r\n    section) which defaults to \"false\" and allows the\r\n    J-3100 version of SimCity and VGA version of the\r\n    Toshiba Windows 3.1 to run, whereas CGA/EGA version\r\n    of the latter requires a \"true\" setting. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Added config options (in \"ethernet, slirp\" section)\r\n    \"tcp_port_forwards\" and \"udp_port_forwards\" for port\r\n    forwarding when using the Slirp backend. (kcgen)\r\n  - Added code pages 737 (Greek) and 775 (Baltic) for\r\n    the guest-to-host code page conversions. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added UTF8 and UTF16 commands to convert UTF-8 and\r\n    UTF-16 text to view in the current code page. For\r\n    example, the command \"UTF8 < UTF8TEXT.TXT\" will\r\n    output converted text UTF8TEXT.TXT in the current\r\n    code page, and for UTF16 command there are optional\r\n    /BE & /LE options to specify endianness. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for DBCS characters located in UNC\r\n    network paths of the form \\\\COMPUTER\\FOLDER\\FILE\r\n    on the Windows platform. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added hidden code page 951 for Big5-HKSCS encoding\r\n    or Big5 Unicode-At-On (Big5-UAO) encoding. Config\r\n    option \"uao\" is added in [ttf] section so that if\r\n    set to \"true\" code page 951 will use the Big5-UAO\r\n    encoding instead of the Big-HKSCS encoding, the\r\n    latter being the default for CP951. If ChinaSea is\r\n    enabled, ChinaSea characters will be used instead\r\n    of original characters in these encodings. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added -nl option for MOUNT command to automatically\r\n    find the next available drive letter to mount if\r\n    the specified drive is already mounted. This allows\r\n    multiple directories to be mounted when DOSBox-X\r\n    starts with multiple [name] arguments. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added HISTORY command to display or clear command-\r\n    line history for the internal DOS shell. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added ASSOC command to view/change file extension\r\n    associations. You can define a command or program\r\n    to open a file with a specific file extension, e.g.\r\n    \"assoc .txt=edit\" to open .TXT files with the EDIT\r\n    command when entering the .TXT file name from the\r\n    DOS command line. Wildcards are allowed, such as\r\n    \"assoc .*=dir\", although in such case exceptions\r\n    including \"assoc .com=com\", \"assoc .exe=exe\", and\r\n    \"assoc .bat=bat\" are probably desired. (Wengier)\r\n  - Commands CHOICE and COUNTRY are external commands\r\n    that appear on the Z drive (Z:/DOS/CHOICE.COM and\r\n    Z:/SYSTEM/COUNTRY.COM respectively) now rather than\r\n    internal shell commands. COUNTRY command now also\r\n    affects thousand and decimal separators. (Wengier)\r\n  - The internal Virtual Drive Z: can now be rescanned\r\n    just like mounted local drives. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now change most config options in [printer]\r\n    section of the configuration for the virtual printer\r\n    with CONFIG -set commands. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added missing ChinaSea characters in code page 950\r\n    with ChinaSea/Big5-2003 extension enabled. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for Bash-shell completion for DOSBox-X\r\n    on non-Windows platforms. (rderooy & FeignInt)\r\n  - Improved DBCS support for DOS commands including\r\n    ATTRIB, ECHO, TYPE, MORE, and TRUENAME. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved checking of segment limits. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Mac OS X builds from now on will use an in-tree tool\r\n    to replace dylib references in all executable files.\r\n    XCode install_name_tool is no longer used, it became\r\n    a hypochondriac and is sitting in the corner screaming\r\n    about link edit data that doesn't fill a __LINKEDIT\r\n    segment. It is once again possible to make Mac OS X\r\n    ARM releases and to use dylib files from Brew doing\r\n    so. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fix IPL1 partition choice debug message to actually\r\n    show the partition index chosen, not the -partidx\r\n    option variable, which if not given by the user, is\r\n    -1 and was reported as a very large unsigned\r\n    number. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed command-line options -starttool & -startmapper\r\n    not showing messages from specified language file\r\n    for Configuration Tool and Mapper Editor. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed an issue with RENDER_Reset function while\r\n    loading previously saved states. (yetmorecode)\r\n  - Fixed E_Exit \"RET from illegal descriptor type 0\"\r\n    when running DirectX diagnostic program (dxdiag)\r\n    from a guest Windows 98 system. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed \"parallel?=file openwith:xxx\" not working if\r\n    a file name is not provided. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed crash in the following config combination:\r\n    output=ttf, machine=pc98, dosvfunc=true. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed Disney sound source connecting to parallel\r\n    port not working in the previous version. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed NET command from Windows for Workgroups 3.11\r\n    not working from the internal DOS shell. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed MODE command options like \"rate\" and \"delay\"\r\n    not working if entered in upper cases. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed command-line parameters (when launching\r\n    DOSBox-X) containing Chinese characters in code page\r\n    950 not working in Windows SDL2 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Improve BIOS FDD motor timeout counter, most\r\n    notably for earlier PCs. Fixes a Chinese variant\r\n    of Space Harrier.\r\n0.83.20\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.20.html\r\n  - Implemented support for Pentium II cputype (with\r\n    the setting \"cputype=pentium_ii\" in [cpu] section),\r\n    and added Pentium II SYSENTER/SYSEXIT instructions\r\n    to normal core and debugger disassembler. The two\r\n    instructions are supported for Pentium II cputype.\r\n    CPUID for Pentium II will now report stepping 3 and\r\n    model 3 which is a minimum requirement for OSes to\r\n    attempt to use SYSENTER/SYSEXIT. Silencing for\r\n    RDMSR/WRMSR and SYSENTER/SYSEXIT debug messages is\r\n    removed while CPU \"debug spew\" is silenced by\r\n    default. MSRs related to Intel microcode are added\r\n    because both Linux and Windows ME probe those MSRs\r\n    if Pentium II emulation reports stepping 3 model 3.\r\n    The microcode MSRs are silently ignored. Moreover,\r\n    the MSR register 0x0000001B has been added to\r\n    Pentium II emulation. DOSBox-X does not emulate a\r\n    local APIC but Windows ME assumes that MSR is\r\n    present and reads/writes it on startup if DOSBox-X\r\n    reports itself as a Pentium II. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added support for DCGA and Toshiba J-3100 emulation\r\n    modes by importing code from DOSVAXJ3 by nanshiki.\r\n    The J-3100 emulation mode can be enabled with the\r\n    option \"dosv=jp\" along with a non-off setting of\r\n    \"j3100\" option in [dosv] section. For example, with\r\n    \"j3100=on\" or \"j3100=auto\" (and \"dosv=jp\") J-3100\r\n    system will be enabled and activated at start. With\r\n    \"j3100=manual\" (and \"dosv=jp\") J-3100 system will\r\n    be enabled and not activated at start, but there is\r\n    now a DCGA command to enter DCGA (either English or\r\n    J-3100 DCGA, depending on if J-3100 is enabled)\r\n    mode from other video modes. (nanshiki & Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for unit tests based on Google Test\r\n    framework (gTest/gMock) to ensure code stability.\r\n    Unit tests can be started with command-line option\r\n    \"-tests\" in the debug builds. Some unit tests are\r\n    ported from DOSBox Staging. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added SERIAL and PARALLEL commands to view/change\r\n    the current configuration of serial/parallel ports.\r\n    Type \"SERIAL /?\" and \"PARALLEL /?\" for further info\r\n    about the two commands. Commands like \"config -set\r\n    serial?=...\" and \"config -set parallel?=...\" will\r\n    also auto-call these commands. (sduensin & Wengier)\r\n  - Added IMGSWAP command to swap disks for drives.\r\n    e.g. \"IMGSWAP D\" to swap D: drive to the next swap\r\n    position, and \"IMGSWAP A 3\" to swap A: drive to\r\n    the 3nd swap position. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added DOS commands including COMP, DISKCOPY, EDLIN,\r\n    FC, FILES, PRINT, and SHUTDOWN (most from FreeDOS)\r\n    to the built-in Z: drive. Updated or recompiled\r\n    EDIT and EDLIN commands to support LFNs. (Wengier)\r\n  - The CAPMOUSE command without a parameter now shows\r\n    whether the mouse is captured/released. (Wengier)\r\n  - The command \"config -set\" is now case-insensitive\r\n    for property names. Also, if an option cannot be\r\n    changed at run-time, DOSBox-X will ask whether to\r\n    restart itself to apply the new setting. (Wengier)\r\n  - Do not read real-mode data areas from mouse event\r\n    handling if running a protected mode guest OS like\r\n    Windows NT, and disable INT 33h functions when DOS\r\n    kernel is shut down to boot into a guest OS. Moving\r\n    mouse while Windows NT is running should no longer\r\n    cause page faults and crashes. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - The setting \"mountwarning = false\" will now silence\r\n    more warning messages during mounting. (Wengier)\r\n  - The code page setting of \"country\" option will now\r\n    be ignored for PC-98, JEGA and DOS/V modes. These\r\n    modes will enforce the desired code page. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for loading the ASC16/ASCFONT.15/\r\n    ASC24/ASCFONT.24? font files from the UCDOS/ETen\r\n    Chinese DOS systems for the options \"fontxsbcs\",\r\n    \"fontxsbcs16\" and \"fontxdbcs24\" in [dosv] section\r\n    of the config file for DOS/V systems. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved auto-detection of box-drawing characters\r\n    when using DBCS code pages. (Wengier)\r\n  - Applied UTF-8 conversions to file browse dialog\r\n    boxes for selecting files containing Unicode\r\n    characters (e.g. CJK characters). (Wengier)\r\n  - For screenshot and MIDI/OPL recording, DOSBox-X\r\n    will now display a message box showing the saved\r\n    file name when the recording has been completed.\r\n    The full paths will also be logged. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added confirmation message while trying to load a\r\n    Direct3D pixel shader which may not be needed or\r\n    may have undesired effect. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added warning message if DOS/V or Japanese PC-98/AX\r\n    machine type is selected and a language file with\r\n    an incompatible code page is specified. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"AMD K6 166 MHz\", \"AMD K6 200 MHz\" and \"AMD\r\n    K6-2 300 MHz\" menu options within the menu group\r\n    \"Emulate CPU speed\" (under \"CPU\"). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added a TrueType font selection page into Windows\r\n    installer, which will show when TrueType font (TTF)\r\n    output is selected for new installations. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added MMX instruction PSHUFW and added typecasts\r\n    to some MMX instructions in case compilers cannot\r\n    properly shift uint64_t by uint8_t otherwise. Most\r\n    Pentium-level MMX instructions (such as MOVD, MOVQ,\r\n    and EMMS) are added to the debugger disassembler\r\n    and support for the disassembler to represent MMX\r\n    registers. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added code to normal core to flush paging TLB\r\n    whenever handing a non-recursive guest page fault.\r\n    The guest OS will likely update the page tables\r\n    to resolve the fault. The Linux kernel will\r\n    constantly get \"stuck\" whenever you run a command\r\n    without this change. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added code to make sure DOS kernel drives and drive\r\n    letters have been unmounted and deallocated before\r\n    booting a guest OS or shutting down DOSBox-X\r\n    (joncampbell123).\r\n  - Added ability to change floppy images with drive\r\n    number (0 or 1) only. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added INT 13h AH=16h, detect disk change. This can\r\n    be controlled by config option \"int 13 disk change\r\n    detect\" (in [dos] section) in case any older OS can\r\n    not handle it. INT 13h AH=15h will report a floppy\r\n    drive with change line support if enabled. MS-DOS\r\n    seems to work just fine with it. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added menu item \"Enable extended Chinese character\r\n    set\" in \"Video\" => \"TTF options\" to toggle setting\r\n    for the Simplified Chinese (GBK extension) and\r\n    Traditional Chinese (ChinaSea extension). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"chinasea\" (in [ttf] section)\r\n    which when set to \"true\" allows ChinaSea (中國海字集)\r\n    and Big5-2003 extension of the original Big5-1984\r\n    charset for Traditional Chinese TTF output. This\r\n    requires the use of a TTF/OTF font containing such\r\n    extended characters to correctly render them; the\r\n    included SarasaGothicFixed TTF font is updated to\r\n    support such characters.Certain Traditional Chinese\r\n    DOS software like the Hyper Editor 5.03 (漢書5) makes\r\n    use of ChinaSea characters. Also moved \"gbk\" config\r\n    option from [dosv] to [ttf] section. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"forcesquarecorner\" (in [sdl]\r\n    section) which when set to \"true\" will force to\r\n    disable rounded corners on Windows 11. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added code to INT 18h emulation (IBM PC mode) to\r\n    jump to ROM BASIC if the user provided an IBM\r\n    ROM BASIC image to load. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added config option \"ibm rom basic\" in [dosbox]\r\n    section which allows users to load a ROM image\r\n    containing IBM PC ROM BASIC, for disk images\r\n    and MS-DOS setups that need it. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added stub IBM ROM BASIC points in the BIOS area\r\n    so that when BASIC(A).COM from MS-DOS 1.x and 2.x\r\n    are run, a polite message is displayed instead of\r\n    invalid code and crashes. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - 8086 and 80186 CPU types no longer check segment\r\n    limits. (joncampbell123 & Allofich)\r\n  - Put in undocumented behavior in opcode 0x8e for\r\n    8086 and 80186. (Allofich)\r\n  - Made 8086 treat opcodes C0,C1,C8,C9,F1 as aliases\r\n    of C2,C3,CA,CB,F0, and opcodes 0x60-0x6F as aliases\r\n    of opcodes 0x70-0x7F. (Allofich)\r\n  - Adjusted multiple-prefix bug for 8086/286 to only\r\n    apply when REP or REPZ is used. (Allofich)\r\n  - Fixed 0x0F opcode being valid on 80186 core when\r\n    it should be invalid. (Allofich)\r\n  - Fixed CGA modes to always use a character height\r\n    of 8, rather than reading it from address 485h.\r\n    Fixes corrupt graphics in the PC Booter version\r\n    of Apple Panic. (Allofich)\r\n  - Fixed underflow when INT 13 AH=2 called for\r\n    sector 0. (Allofich)\r\n  - Fixed infinite loop when trying to run a 32-bit\r\n    program with the 8086 CPU type. (Allofich)\r\n  - Fixed INT 13h emulation to no longer call the DOS\r\n    kernel \"DriveManager\" if the DOS kernel has been\r\n    shutdown. This fixes memory corruption issues in\r\n    the guest OS system run by the BOOT command that\r\n    can occur when the \"swap disks\" command is used in\r\n    the emulator. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed DTA memory leak from FAT driver if FAT drive\r\n    was mounted when booting into a guest OS. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed a crash on unmount that occurs if IMGMOUNT\r\n    is used to mount multiple floppy disk images to\r\n    a drive letter. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed possible crash with printing. (jamesbond3142)\r\n  - Fixed possible freeze when shutting down Windows 9x\r\n    after changing a CD image from the menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the default U.S. keyboard layout for the\r\n    HX-DOS build. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed copying full-screen or multi-line text from a\r\n    DBCS codepage in TTF output or PC98 mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed possible crash at start with getsysfont=true\r\n    when a font may not be obtained on some Chinese\r\n    Windows systems. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed TTF color issue with some DOS GUI programs by\r\n    initializing the color scheme when with default\r\n    COLORS= setting in EGA or VGA mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed some Direct3D pixel shaders not working (such\r\n    as GS2x and CRT-geom-blend). (Wengier & depaljas)\r\n  - Fixed config option windowposition=x,y not working\r\n    in Linux/macOS SDL1 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed copying files from the virtual drive Z: not\r\n    working when using the 4DOS shell. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed some issues in MORE command. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed \"DIR>NUL\" freeze/crash when only disk or CD\r\n    images are mounted. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Fixed BIOS screen when resetting the machine with a\r\n    non-TTF output and DOS/V mode enabled. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the key `/~ not working when IME is enabled\r\n    on a non-Japanese keyboard. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed display glitches in the game \"Continuing\r\n    adventures of Cyberbox\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed unusable joystick with config options like\r\n    joy1response1 set to certain values. (Baderian)\r\n  - Make memory B0000-B7FFF unmapped for the CGA\r\n    emulation. Fixes \"Backgammon 5.0\" detecting that\r\n    an MDA is also present when using CGA. (Allofich)\r\n  - Make floppy I/O delay separately configurable from\r\n    hard drive delay, and make it slower than before\r\n    by default. It is adjustable via the \"floppy drive\r\n    data rate limit\" config option. (Allofich)\r\n  - Always return bit 6 of port 61h as set for PC and as\r\n    clear for PCjr and Tandy. Allows Zaxxon to load in\r\n    PC mode. (Allofich)\r\n  - Video emulation for PC-98 mode (for 400-line modes)\r\n    is now 16:10 instead of 4:3. 480-line PC-98 modes\r\n    are still 4:3. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - PC-98 EGC emulation: Add generic ope_xx handler for\r\n    the remaining block of undefined/undocumented EGC\r\n    ROPs. This fixes \"Atomic Punker\" which uses EGC ROP\r\n    0xBE for sprite rendering. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Don't run mouse setup code if there is no emulated\r\n    mouse. (Allofich)\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Add proper opl3 handling of the waveform select\r\n    to dbopl.\r\n    - Correct disassembly of some FPU instructions.\r\n0.83.19\r\n  - Reorganized the \"List network interfaces\" and \"List\r\n    printer devices\" dialogs (under the \"Help\" menu) to\r\n    allow the use of scroll bars. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu option \"Reset TTF color scheme\" to reset\r\n    the current color scheme for TTF output. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"righttoleft\" in [TTF] section\r\n    which when set to \"true\" will cause DOSBox-X to\r\n    display text from right to left (instead of left to\r\n    right) for the TTF output. It can also be toggled\r\n    from the menu (\"Video\" => \"TTF options\" => \"Display\r\n    text from right to left\"). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"vga fill active memory\" which\r\n    when set to \"true\" will fill inactive video memory\r\n    regions with RAM rather than mapping them as empty.\r\n    This allows the ETen Chinese DOS system (倚天中文系統)\r\n    3.5/2000 (e.g. ET16V and ET24VA) to run. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"middle_unlock\" ([sdl] section)\r\n    to control whether to unlock the mouse with middle\r\n    mouse button click. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"dosvfunc\" in [ttf] section to\r\n    support DOS/V applications when country information\r\n    is set to Japan in TTF output. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Added \"VTEXT\" command to view or change the current\r\n    V-text mode for the DOS/V emulation. Also improved\r\n    the font support for 24-pixel font DOS/V mode, such\r\n    as supporting HZK24? fonts for Simplified Chinese\r\n    DOS/V mode and STDFONT.24 from ETen Chinese system\r\n    for Traditional Chinese DOS/V mode. If a Chinese\r\n    font is specified via \"fontxdbcs\", \"fontxdbcs14\" or\r\n    \"fontxdbcs24\" options, it will be loaded before\r\n    system font even with \"getsysfont=true\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Commands like 80x25, 80x43, ... now use internal\r\n    function for better compatibility with the TrueType\r\n    font (TTF) output. (Wengier)\r\n  - MODE command without a parameter will now print the\r\n    current lines/columns instead of usage. (Wengier)\r\n  - INTVEC debugger command now correctly outputs\r\n    addresses when in protected mode. (Allofich)\r\n  - Fix horizontal lines in the debugger window being\r\n    rendered as unrelated characters in some code\r\n    pages. (Allofich)\r\n  - INT 21 AX=4B03 now sets AX to 0000 like MS-DOS\r\n    does. Fixes missing music in \"聊齋誌異之幽谷傳奇\"\r\n    (Liáozhāi zhì yì zhī yōugǔ chuánqí) (Allofich)\r\n  - Use 0x1E to 0x3E for the keyboard buffer of the CGA\r\n    machine, which fixes the controls locking up in the\r\n    PC booter version of Apple Panic. (Allofich)\r\n  - Allowed machine types \"pcjr_composite\" and\r\n    \"pcjr_composite2\", similar to \"cga_composite\" and\r\n    \"cga_composite2\", instead of having to switch the\r\n    composite type manually. (Wengier)\r\n  - If machine is PCjr, place PC BIOS reset code at\r\n    F000:0043 to match that of the real BIOS.\r\n  - Fix PCjr NMI handler to load DS with segment 0x0040.\r\n    Fixes crashes in SHAMUS. (Allofich)\r\n  - Fix PCjr NMI handler to use 8086-level instructions\r\n    when loading DS with segment 0x0040 so that it\r\n    works properly with cputype=8086.\r\n  - Remove useless check for signed divide quotient\r\n    of 0x80/0x8000/etc. (the result was -0x80/0x8000/etc\r\n    anyway. Add code to check specifically for these\r\n    values after signed divide if cputype=8086 and\r\n    trigger divide overflow exception, to match behavior\r\n    described for the 8086 processor.\r\n  - Modify exception handling so that for cputype=8086\r\n    the return address for an exception handler points\r\n    at instruction after fault location.\r\n  - Fix IDIV instruction incorrectly raising a divide\r\n    error exception for some borderline values. Fixes\r\n    Microsoft Flight Simulator. (Allofich)\r\n  - IBM PC BIOS emulation fixed to place key pieces of\r\n    code and entry points at fixed legacy locations\r\n    required by some older DOS games, instead of\r\n    by dynamic allocation. Added code to BIOS allocation\r\n    to reserve F000:E000 or higher for fixed allocation\r\n    and force dynamic allocation below that address to\r\n    prevent further conflicts should others submit\r\n    pull requests for additional fixed locations. This\r\n    fixes some games like \"聊齋誌異之幽谷傳奇\" (Liáozhāi\r\n    zhì yì zhī yōugǔ chuánqí) which appear to assume\r\n    some of these fixed BIOS addresses and will\r\n    crash if they are wrong.\r\n  - Added tool EMSMAGIC.COM as alternative EMS manager,\r\n    which can be dynamically installed or uninstalled\r\n    with the setting ems=false. (Wengier)\r\n  - If a program is provided in the command-line when\r\n    launching DOSBox-X, it will now be executed after\r\n    any commands in the [autoexec] section by default.\r\n    A command-line option \"-prerun\" is added to force\r\n    the program run before any commands in [autoexec]\r\n    section like before. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added auto-detection for single-wide DBCS-encoded\r\n    characters for the TTF output (non-PC98). (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved the menu option \"Restart DOSBox-X with\r\n    language file...\" (under \"Main\") for switching\r\n    between DBCS languages. (Wengier)\r\n  - Disabled the Alt+F4 key for closing the DOSBox-X\r\n    window in MinGW SDL2 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed program or config file containing Unicode\r\n    characters passed from command-line when launching\r\n    DOSBox-X in Windows SDL2 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed issue with DELETE key in PC-98 mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed COLORS config option (in [ttf] section) not\r\n    working in the previous version. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed issues after resetting the virtual machine\r\n    when using DBCS language files. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed some issues related to system IME support for\r\n    CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) languages, for both\r\n    Windows SDL1 and SDL2 builds. (nanshiki & Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed bugs in the region memory allocator C++ class\r\n    that claimed the entire free block even if the\r\n    size wanted was smaller. Added field to remember if\r\n    the allocated block was allocated for fixed or\r\n    dynamically allocated memory. Cleaned up allocator\r\n    code and removed redundancy.\r\n  - Fix SELINFO command not showing output correctly\r\n    in the debugger window. (Allofich)\r\n  - Better CMOS register B and C emulation. (Allofich)\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Support for DMF floppy disk images.\r\n    - Zero-out DX in EXEC overlay command.\r\n    - Improve stack check for wrap-around cases.\r\n    - Change to misc_output for SVGA_S3Trio.\r\n0.83.18\r\n  - Cleaned up and more accurately worded CMOS-related\r\n    log messages. (Allofich)\r\n  - Fixed the names of virtual files and files on mounted\r\n    FAT drive images being logged as \"(null)\". (Allofich)\r\n  - Fixed packed structure alignment problem with MSVC\r\n    (Microsoft C++) builds regarding some disk image\r\n    formats. These problems prevented VS2019 builds from\r\n    mounting hard disk images. (Allofich)\r\n  - REP STOSB will correctly move one byte if one byte\r\n    remains to be processed aka CX == 1, this is needed\r\n    for FD98.COM self clearing code to work properly. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Fixed IOCTL support for character device drivers. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Fixed ANSI ESC [6n escape handling to correctly\r\n    report cursor position as 1-based count, not 0-based\r\n    count. (nanshiki)\r\n  - PC-98 INT DCh emulation fixed to better represent the\r\n    function key shortcuts as real DOS does. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Emulator fix for HX-DOS builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Fix the return value of register al from INT10 ah=0x0F\r\n    for non EGA/VGA machines.\r\n0.83.17\r\n  - Added FISTTP instruction to experimental cputype (LBi)\r\n  - Updated debugger to support and decode fisttp, fcomi,\r\n    fcomip, fucomi, fucomip (LBi)\r\n  - Added support for Chinese/Japanese/Korean IMEs on\r\n    Windows/Linux SDL2 builds. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Added cputype=experimental, which is the same as the\r\n    highest CPU emulation level but with additional\r\n    instructions from newer processors that do not exist\r\n    in the era emulated by DOSBox-X i.e. FISTTP which is\r\n    an SSE3 Pentium 4 instruction. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added support for 286/386 call gates to JMP\r\n    instruction (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added -bd <n> option to IMGMOUNT to allow mounting\r\n    partitions from a hard disk image mounted as an\r\n    INT 13h hard disk. <n> is the numeric value the\r\n    hard disk image was mounted to. In this way, it\r\n    becomes possible to mount any or all partitions\r\n    in a hard disk image. WARNING: To safely mount\r\n    multiple partitions, use -o partidx=<n> to specify\r\n    each partition you mount by index. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - If a drive has no volume label, and user runs\r\n    LABEL without specifying one, do not ask whether\r\n    or not to delete the volume label because there\r\n    is in fact no volume label to delete. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added FreeDOS utilities DEFRAG, FORMAT, FDISK,\r\n    CHKDSK, and SYS to the built-in Z drive. KERNEL.SYS\r\n    is not provided so that the user can provide what\r\n    they consider the best version of the FreeDOS kernel\r\n    to format with if they use FORMAT /S (joncampbell123)\r\n  - INT 29h routes output through ANSI.SYS driver in\r\n    both IBM PC and PC-98 mode, unless ansi.sys=false\r\n    is set in the config setting. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Fix regression in r4444: Hercules machine type\r\n    cursor translation.\r\n    - Remove redundant signature for ET4K that is now\r\n    done in video BIOS.\r\n    - Implement mouse driver function 0x27, fixes\r\n    Alive - Behind the Moon.\r\n    - Add log message for unusual cases where an\r\n    executable unsafely places its initial stack outside\r\n    the memory block.\r\n0.83.16\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.16.html\r\n  - Added support for extended MS-DOS partitions that\r\n    reside in extended partitions. These partitions\r\n    can be manually mounted using -o partidx=n where\r\n    n is 4 or larger. To assist in partition indexes,\r\n    the FAT driver will also print the partition\r\n    table to your log file and console when asked to\r\n    print debug information. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added dosbox-x.conf options to control VESA BIOS\r\n    window size and window granularity. This allows\r\n    DOS development to test VESA BIOS support against\r\n    SVGA cards that use window sizes and/or window\r\n    granularity other than 64KB including older SVGA\r\n    hardware by Paradise and Cirrus. Note that use\r\n    of these options is intended solely for DOS\r\n    development and will break S3 drivers that do not\r\n    use the VESA BIOS extensions. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed VESA BIOS S3 modelist to match the VBE 1.2\r\n    standard modelist properly, including the addition\r\n    of modes 0x119-0x11B. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added machine=vesa_oldvbe10 to emulate a VESA\r\n    BIOS that follows version 1.0 of the standard.\r\n    Specifically, in version 1.0, mode information\r\n    like XResolution was OPTIONAL and the VESA BIOS\r\n    was allowed not to fill it in since you could\r\n    assume the information from the standard video\r\n    mode number you applied. This setting emulates\r\n    a VESA BIOS that does NOT provide this information,\r\n    for testing purposes. Also, machine=vesa_oldvbe is\r\n    fixed to never report a LFB, since that was not yet\r\n    defined for VBE 1.2. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Reorganized Windows installation to 2 installers\r\n    installing 32-bit and 64-bit DOSBox-X binaries,\r\n    for WinXP+ (all) and Vista+ 64-bit respectively,\r\n    reducing the sizes of installers significantly\r\n    while adding the SarasaGothicFixed TTF font and\r\n    a language selection page for choosing existing\r\n    language translations (with new language files\r\n    for French and Traditional Chinese). (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now search for more paths (such as\r\n    user config directory and \"languages\" subfolder)\r\n    for loading language files before failing, and\r\n    on Linux and macOS platforms will also search for\r\n    additional directories such as /Library/Fonts/\r\n    (Linux) or /Library/Fonts/ (macOS) for TrueType\r\n    fonts when using the TTF output. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will try to load the SarasaGothicFixed\r\n    TTF font when no external TTF font is specified\r\n    and a CJK code page detected at start. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added Shift+Tab shortcut in Debugger to switch to\r\n    previous window complimenting existing function of\r\n    Tab switching to the next window. (cimarronm)\r\n  - LH/LOADHIGH command can now load programs into UMB\r\n    memory if it is available. Also added \"shellhigh\"\r\n    config option to decide whether to load builtin\r\n    command shell to UMB memory (with default setting\r\n    of \"auto\", it is enabled if reported DOS version\r\n    is at least 7, similar to MS-DOS 7+). (cimarronm)\r\n  - HELP command is now an external command appearing\r\n    on Z drive rather than an internal shell command\r\n    (it is never a DOS internal command). (Wengier)\r\n  - Command-line options -eraseconf and -erasemapper\r\n    will now erase loaded config file and mapper file\r\n    respectively and continue, whereas -resetconf and\r\n    -resetmapper will erase user config file or user\r\n    mapper file and exit as before. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu group \"3dfx\" in \"Video\" menu to toggle\r\n    the low-level Voodoo card emulation and high-level\r\n    Glide emulation at run-time. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu options \"Restart DOSBox-X instance\" and\r\n    \"Restart DOSBox-X with language file\" in \"Main\"\r\n    menu to reboot the current DOSBox-X instance or\r\n    reboot the DOSBox-X instance with the specified\r\n    language file automatically. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu options \"Show code overview\" and \"Show\r\n    logging text\" in \"Debug\" menu to show the overview\r\n    of the current code and the output of DOSBox-X's\r\n    current logging text in debug builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"customcodepage\" in the [dos]\r\n    section to allow a custom code page, in the format\r\n    \"customcodepage=nnn,codepagefile\" in TrueType font\r\n    (TTF) output. CHCP command also supports additional\r\n    parameter to specify a code page file. Also added\r\n    builtin support for code pages 1250-1258. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"transparency\" in [sdl] section\r\n    to change the DOSBox-X window transparency (from 0\r\n    to 90, low to high transparency) on the Linux/macOS\r\n    SDL2 and Windows platforms. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"hidenonpresentable\" in [dos]\r\n    section to toggle whether to filter out file names\r\n    on local drives that are non-representative in\r\n    current code page. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config options \"pc-98 try font rom\" and\r\n    \"pc-98 anex86 font\" for the PC-98 emulation to\r\n    customize the font file to load. If former option\r\n    is set to \"false\", then DOSbox-X will not try to\r\n    load FONT.ROM first for PC-98, and latter option\r\n    specifies an Anex86-compatible font to load for\r\n    PC-98 (before trying FREECG98.BMP). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for composite support for PCjr mode\r\n    by porting patch from NewRisingSun. (Wengier)\r\n  - Non-Japanese DOS/V systems will now use 19-pixel\r\n    VGA fonts rather than 16-pixel VGA fonts for SBCS\r\n    characters to look better. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now also load HZK14/HZK16 font files (for\r\n    14- and 16-pixel height) and STDFONT.15 font file\r\n    via the \"fontxdbcs\" and \"fontxdbcs14\" options for\r\n    Simplified Chinese DOS/V (dosv=cn) and Traditional\r\n    Chinese DOS/V (dosv=tw) emulations. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved the DOS/V font acquisition function on\r\n    the Linux platform (both SDL1 & SDL2), such as\r\n    adding support for 14-pixel height fonts (used by\r\n    Configuration Tool & Mapper Editor), and enhancing\r\n    support for Chinese characters acquisition (e.g.\r\n    WenQuanYi support for the Traditional Chinese). A\r\n    config option \"getsysfont\" is added which when set\r\n    to \"false\" will disable the font acquisition on\r\n    Windows and Linux platforms. (Wengier & nanshiki)\r\n  - Implemented support for inputting CJK characters\r\n    on Linux SDL1 builds using Linux system IMEs. Code\r\n    imported from SDL-IM-plus by nanshiki and confirmed\r\n    to work on Linux/X11 platform by him.\r\n  - Added support for inputting Japanese and Korean\r\n    characters using system input method (IME) using\r\n    the default \"windib\" video driver in Windows SDL1\r\n    build (in addition to \"directx\" driver). (nanshiki)\r\n  - Fixed CJK characters not showing correctly for the\r\n    SDL-drawn menu with OpenGL outputs if \"language\"\r\n    config option is used instead of -lang command-line\r\n    option. Thank nanshiki for catching this. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed setting \"machine=amstrad\" cause DOSBox-X to\r\n    crash on non-Windows platforms. (cimarronm)\r\n  - Fixed bug related to DBCS vector table. (nanshiki)\r\n  - Fixed running e.g. built-in DEBUG command from a\r\n    drive other than Z may not work. (cimarronm)\r\n  - Fixed the command \"FOR %I ...\" not working when\r\n    executed from the command line. (Wengier)\r\n  - For audio/video recording, DOSBox-X will display\r\n    a message box showing the saved file name when the\r\n    recording has been completed. (Wengier)\r\n  - Mapper Editor will try to show the actual mod keys\r\n    for mod1/mod2/mod3 when clicked. (Wengier)\r\n  - Removed the special DOS function at Int21h/AH=2B/\r\n    CX=0x4442h/DX=0x2D58h in favor of the DOSBox-X\r\n    Integration Device at I/O ports 28h-2Bh which works\r\n    for both integrated DOS and guest OS environments.\r\n  - Enabled MT-32 emulation on ARM-based Mac OS X\r\n    builds (joncampbell123)\r\n  - For Configuration Tool, ensure mouse coordinates\r\n    are adjusted accordingly with forced scaler. (aybe)\r\n  - Fixed a bug in the Int21/AH=36h (get disk space)\r\n    function for returning very large CX values, and\r\n    that non-zero values are returned when the free\r\n    space is 0 on mounted local drives. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed \"FILES\" always fixed to 200 as reported by\r\n    the \"DOSINFO\" tool, in spite of \"files\" setting in\r\n    [config] section of the config file. (Wengier)\r\n  - Refined the handling of international keyboards and\r\n    fixed some issues in version 0.83.15. (maron2000)\r\n  - Fixed initialization order that prevented Bochs\r\n    port E9h emulation from working. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed menu options in system menu not working in\r\n    Windows SDL1 builds with \"windib\" driver. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed issue that the mouse cursor not showing in\r\n    the game \"Power Dolls\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed non-English accents may not show correctly\r\n    with a SBCS code page in TrueType Font (TTF) output\r\n    (introduced in version 0.83.15). (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed line endings for SBCS language files such as\r\n    English and Spanish translations. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed resetting the TTF screen when exiting from\r\n    Configuration Tool or Mapper Editor when TrueType\r\n    font (TTF) output is active. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the option \"drive z expand path\" not working\r\n    if Virtual Drive Z: has been moved to a different\r\n    drive letter (e.g. Drive Y:). (Wengier)\r\n0.83.15\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.15.html\r\n  - Enhanced the network redirector functions for the\r\n    Windows platform, so that you can for example list,\r\n    open, write, copy, and execute files in UNC network\r\n    paths in the form \\\\COMPUTER\\FOLDER directly when\r\n    network redirector function is enabled and secure\r\n    mode is disabled on Windows systems. (Wengier)\r\n  - MOUNT command followed by a drive letter only will\r\n    show the current status of the drive, or show that\r\n    the drive is not mounted if so. You can make the\r\n    message shorter with the -q option, and filter out\r\n    non-local drives with \"-o local\" option. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added NE2000.COM (packet driver for NE2000 network\r\n    card) which will appear in Z:\\SYSTEM directory when\r\n    NE2000 networking feature is enabled. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added /H option to TRUENAME command to return the\r\n    full filename on the host system for a specified\r\n    file/directory on a mounted local drive. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added option \"starttranspath\" which if set to true\r\n    will automatically translath all paths in command-\r\n    line to host system paths when starting programs to\r\n    run on the host system. You can also toggle this\r\n    function dynamically from the drop-down menu (\"DOS\"\r\n    => \"Host system applications\" => \"Translate paths\r\n    to host system paths\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Added option \"drive z expand path\" which when set\r\n    to true (default) will automatically expand %PATH%\r\n    environment variable to include the subdirectories\r\n    on the Z drive when only the Z:\\ path is specified\r\n    for compatibility purposes. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added option \"turbo\" in [cpu] section to enable\r\n    Turbo (Fast Forward) mode at start. You can also\r\n    change it from the command-line via CONFIG command\r\n    (e.g. \"config -set turbo=true\"). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added value \"quiet\" to \"log console\" config option\r\n    to only log DOS console outputs. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu command to spawn a new instance of\r\n    DOSBox-X to Mac OS X builds to work around the\r\n    singular app instance model the Finder tends to\r\n    prefer, so that users can run multiple instances\r\n    if they wish. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - MacOS builds will once again have Fluidsynth,\r\n    libslirp, and FFMPEG support from revised .app\r\n    building code. For best results support is enabled\r\n    at compile time only if Brew is installed along\r\n    with Brew builds of those packages. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - MacOS coreaudio MIDI support will continue with\r\n    the default soundfont rather than giving up\r\n    if it cannot select the custom soundfont specified\r\n    in the config file. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Fixed MacOS bug where coremidi would attempt\r\n    MIDI output even if no MIDI destinations are\r\n    available, which is apparently the case on\r\n    Big Sur. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - The names of advanced config options will now be\r\n    listed in the common config reference file (i.e.\r\n    dosbox-x.reference.conf) too. Several previously\r\n    advanced options are now common options. (Wengier)\r\n  - Command \"CONFIG -L\" will now list the global config\r\n    file for DOSBox-X (if any). (Wengier)\r\n  - There is now a special DOS function for DOSBox-X at\r\n    Int21h/AH=2B/CX=0x4442h('DB')/DX=0x2D58h('-X'), as\r\n    follows: AL=0h (DOSBox-X installation check), AL=1h\r\n    (SDL version check), AL=2h (platform check), AL=3h\r\n    (machine type check), and AL=4h (DOSBox-X version\r\n    check). For example, you can get installed DOSBox-X\r\n    version by calling the function Int21h/AX=2B04h/CX=\r\n    0x4442h/DX=0x2D58h in your program - AL and AH will\r\n    become 0, and BX will return the DOSBox-X version\r\n    number after \"0.\" (e.g. BH=83, BL=15). (Wengier)\r\n  - It is now possible to translate text for graphical\r\n    Configuration Tool and Mapper Editor interfaces.\r\n    The sizes and/or positions of some buttons in these\r\n    interfaces are adjusted accordingly too. (Wengier)\r\n  - Config option \"usescancodes=auto\" now implies false\r\n    for PC-98 mode in SDL1 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Config option \"pc-98 force ibm keyboard layout\" now\r\n    defaults to \"auto\", which implies \"true\" if a U.S.\r\n    keyboard layout is detected and implies \"false\"\r\n    otherwise. Also fixed some input keys for the PC-98\r\n    mode. (Wengier & maron2000)\r\n  - For PC-98 mode, if both FONT.ROM and FREECG98.BMP\r\n    are not found in the directory, then DOSBox-X will\r\n    now use internal Japanese font (also used by DOS/V\r\n    and JEGA systems) and the built-in 8x16 SBCS font\r\n    pre-generated from FREECG98.BMP. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added DBCS awareness support for special characters\r\n    \"\\\" and \"|\" in Chinese/Japanese/Korean code pages\r\n    so that they will be treated properly as trailing\r\n    bytes of double-byte characters. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved handling of clipboard copy/paste involving\r\n    DBCS characters with TrueType font (TTF) output in\r\n    standard mode. The clipboard copy/paste feature is\r\n    also supported in DOS/V and JEGA modes. (Wengier)\r\n  - The config option ttf.halfwidthkana (now in [ttf]\r\n    section) will enable low ASCII boxing characters\r\n    for the TrueType font (TTF) output too. This option\r\n    is now enabled by default for JP mode, and printing\r\n    these characters is also supported. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for showing Chinese/Japanese/Korean\r\n    characters in the SDL-drawn menu (in addition to\r\n    characters in different SBCS code pages) and the\r\n    Configuration Tool interface (so e.g. DOS command\r\n    help will show correctly for these languages). You\r\n    can change the DBCS font used by Configuration Tool\r\n    interface via fontxdbcs14 config option. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for inputting DBCS characters using\r\n    system input method (IME) in Windows SDL1 build.\r\n    Chinese (Simplified and Traditional) IMEs may work\r\n    with the default video setting and a Chinese code\r\n    page or Chinese DOS/V mode. Japanese & Korean IMEs\r\n    may require DirectX mode for the SDL1 library (set\r\n    option \"videodriver\" to \"directx\" in [sdl] section\r\n    for this). There is a new config option \"ime\" in\r\n    [dosbox] section to control it. When set to \"auto\"\r\n    (default), it is enabled for Windows SDL1 builds\r\n    only if DOSBox-X is started with a CJK code page or\r\n    in PC-98, JEGA or DOS/V mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for Japanese EGA mode (machine=jega)\r\n    by adopting code from DOSVAXJ3. As with DOS/V, you\r\n    can optionally set the SBCS and DBCS fonts with\r\n    fontxsbcs, fontxdbcs (and fontxsbcs19, fontxdbcs24,\r\n    etc) options in [dosv] section of config file, or\r\n    the default fonts will be used for them. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for DOS/V (Japanese mode) by adopting\r\n    code from DOSVAXJ3. Also added support for Chinese\r\n    and Korean DOS/V modes. Set option \"dosv\" to \"jp\",\r\n    \"chs\" (or \"cn\"), \"cht\" (or \"tw\"), or \"ko\" in [dosv]\r\n    section of the config file to enable DOS/V mode for\r\n    different CJK languages. There are now also various\r\n    font-related (and V-text screen mode) options added\r\n    in [dosv] section for the DOS/V support. For the\r\n    Simplified Chinese (code page 936), you can also\r\n    enable GBK extension of the standard GB2312 charset\r\n    with \"gbk\" option for Simplified Chinese DOS/V and\r\n    the TrueType font (TTF) output. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for codepage conversion of file names\r\n    in \"drivez\" folder (for customization of Virtual\r\n    Drive Z:) so that they will appear properly on this\r\n    drive according to the code page set. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved support for DBCS (double-byte) characters\r\n    on mounted FAT drives with Chinese/Japanese/Korean\r\n    codepages (932/936/949/950). (Wengier)\r\n  - The \"Unexpected control character\" error message\r\n    which may appear when executing certain batch files\r\n    is now a debug message (belong to the \"misc\" type)\r\n    instead of showing to the DOS console output.\r\n  - Added \"videodriver\" config option in [sdl] section\r\n    to force a video driver (such as windib/windows,\r\n    x11, dummy) for the SDL library to use. The video\r\n    driver \"directx\" has been enabled for Windows SDL1\r\n    builds (without certain functions). (Wengier)\r\n  - There is a now a [ttf] section in the config file,\r\n    and TTF-related config options are moved/renamed\r\n    from [render] section to this section (previous\r\n    config options \"ttf.*\" in [render] section become\r\n    * (with \"ttf.\" dropped) in [ttf] section). Windows\r\n    installer will also automatically transfer previous\r\n    TTF options to the new [ttf] section. (Wengier)\r\n  - When setting to \"auto\", config option \"allow lmsw\r\n    to exit protected mode\" will be active for Pentium+\r\n    CPUs instead of 486+ CPUs. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed a bug which may lead to crash when pasting\r\n    text via the DOS clipboard API (e.g. the 4DOS CLIP:\r\n    device) in non-Windows platforms. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the possible freeze when output was switched\r\n    from TrueType font (TTF) output and you tried to\r\n    reset the virtual machine. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed non-representative filenames on local drives\r\n    in current code page causing memory corruption for\r\n    e.g. Windows 3.1 Setup on non-Windows platforms.\r\n    These entries will no longer appear to DOS guest\r\n    system in incompatible code pages. (Wengier)\r\n0.83.14\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.14.html\r\n  - Added support for directories on the Z drive, so\r\n    there is no need to put all files/programs on the\r\n    root directory of Z drive any more. Only one-level\r\n    directories are currently supported. There are now\r\n    six directories on the Z drive by default, namely\r\n    4DOS, BIN, DEBUG, DOS, SYSTEM, TEXTUTIL. Most files\r\n    that previously appeared on the root directory of\r\n    Z drive are now categorized into directories, with\r\n    addition of some files/programs, such as additional\r\n    4DOS files, text utilities in TEXTUTIL directory\r\n    and TITLE command to change window title. Default\r\n    value of the %PATH% environment variable has been\r\n    expanded to include these subdirectories, but if\r\n    you use a custom path then you may want to include\r\n    these directories in your %PATH%. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now specify a command shell located on a\r\n    mounted local drive via SHELL= command in [config]\r\n    section of config file after the drive is properly\r\n    mounted via INSTALL= command. (Wengier)\r\n  - Extended START command to Linux and macOS systems.\r\n    It's disabled by default just like on Windows host\r\n    systems, but can be enabled by setting \"startcmd\"\r\n    to \"true\" or with the -hostrun command-line option\r\n    (replacing -winrun command-line option). (Wengier)\r\n  - CHCP command in the TrueType font (TTF) output now\r\n    allows code page 932, 936, 949, and 950 to display\r\n    Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters and file\r\n    names with DBCS support enabled in non-PC98 mode.\r\n    By default DOSBox-X will enable DBCS characters and\r\n    auto-detection for box-drawing characters in these\r\n    code pages, and these can be disabled by setting\r\n    new options \"ttf.autodbcs\" and \"ttf.autoboxdraw\" to\r\n    \"false\". There is also option \"ttf.halfwidthkana\"\r\n    to enable half-width Katakana in Japanese non-PC98\r\n    machines. KEYB command (and \"keyboardlayout\" config\r\n    option) also accept \"jp\", \"ko\", \"cn\", \"tw\", \"hk\",\r\n    \"zh\" as key layout names for code pages. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for printing Chinese/Japanese/Korean\r\n    DBCS (double-byte) characters when these code pages\r\n    are active, which by default (\"auto\") is enabled for\r\n    the TTF output, but can be enable or disabled for\r\n    all outputs by setting option \"printdbcs\" to \"true\"\r\n    or \"false\" in [printer] section. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added ability to toggle between Shift-JIS (or Kanji)\r\n    and graphical modes using Ctrl+F4 key (or ESC )3 and\r\n    ESC )0 escape sequences) in the PC-98 mode. There\r\n    is now also an indication of graphical mode in the\r\n    function row. (nmlgc)\r\n  - Added the \"usesystemcursor\" config option (in [sdl]\r\n    section) which when set to true will use host system\r\n    mouse cursor instead of drawing a DOS mouse cursor\r\n    when the mouse is not locked. (Wengier)\r\n  - When opening \"Save...\" or \"Save Language File...\"\r\n    dialogs in the Configuration Tool, the new dialogs\r\n    will now automatically be in focus. For the language\r\n    file, the name of the current language file will be\r\n    filled and modifiable. Pressing ENTER key saves the\r\n    config or language file, and pressing ESC key will\r\n    close these dialog boxes. (Wengier)\r\n  - Command \"CONFIG -wl\" will show the name of language\r\n    file being written to (if there is a language file\r\n    loaded then \"CONFIG -wl\" alone will write to it),\r\n    and command \"CONFIG -ln\" will show current language\r\n    name (if any), or you can use command \"CONFIG -ln\r\n    <lang_name> -wl <lang_file>\" to specify a language\r\n    name when writing to a language file. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added special properties to CONFIG command such as\r\n    \"hostos\", \"programdir\", \"workdir\", \"configdir\", and\r\n    \"userconfigdir\" so that commands like \"CONFIG -GET\r\n    hostos\" and \"CONFIG -GET workdir\" will get the host\r\n    system OS and DOSBox-X working directory. (Wengier)\r\n  - If a config option can only be changed at run-time,\r\n    \"CONFIG -set\" will now show such a message. You can\r\n    use \"CONFIG -setf\" to bypass, but the setting won't\r\n    take effect in the current session. (Wengier)\r\n  - SETCOLOR command can now change the text-mode color\r\n    schemes in outputs rather than the TrueType font\r\n    output too (VGA mode only). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for new TTF word processor type \"FE\"\r\n    for FastEdit, a new DOS text editor with functions\r\n    to view and change text styles. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"ttf.wpfg\" config option in [render] section\r\n    which can optionally specify a foreground color\r\n    (0-7) for the TTF output, similar to \"ttf.wpbg\" for\r\n    the background color in the TTF output. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"ttf.printfont\" config option in [render]\r\n    section which when set to true (default) will force\r\n    to use the current TrueType font (set via ttf.font)\r\n    for printing too when using TTF output. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added additional options to the \"mouse_wheel_key\"\r\n    config option to allow conversion of mouse wheel\r\n    movements into Ctrl+up/down arrow (option 4), Ctrl+\r\n    left/right arrows (option 5), Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn keys\r\n    (option 6), and Ctrl+W/Z as used by WordStar & EDIT\r\n    (option 7) . More menu options are added to \"Mouse\r\n    wheel movements\" menu group as well. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu option \"Print text screen\" (under \"DOS\")\r\n    to print current DOS text screen, if the printer\r\n    feature has been enabled. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu options \"Display TTF blinking cursor\",\r\n    \"CJK: Switch DBCS/SBCS mode\", \"CJK: Auto-detect\r\n    box-drawing characters\" and \"CJK: Allow half-width\r\n    Japanese Katahana\" under \"Video\" => \"TTF options\"\r\n    menu group to toggle the TTF options ttf.blinkc,\r\n    ttf.autodbcs, ttf.autoboxdraw and ttf.halfwidthkana\r\n    in [render] section of the config file. (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for UTF-8 encoded language files. Specify\r\n    a DOS code page with \"country\" option in [config]\r\n    section of the config file. Windows SDL1 menu and\r\n    macOS menu are now also compatible with Unicode\r\n    language files and characters. Also improved code\r\n    page compatibility for text in the SDL drawn menu\r\n    and the Configuration Tool. (Wengier)\r\n  - Cleaned up the welcome banner messages and other\r\n    messages involving boxdrawing characters for easier\r\n    translations into certain languages. (Wengier)\r\n  - Command-line option -silent now implies -nomenu,\r\n    SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy and will disable all sound-\r\n    related config option as well. (Wengier)\r\n  - Command-line option -fastlaunch will now suppress\r\n    messages by \"automountall=true\" option. Also added\r\n    value \"quiet\" to \"automountall\" config option to\r\n    auto-mount all Windows drives quietly. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added default value \"auto\" to \"backend\" option in\r\n    [ne2000] section of the configuration which will\r\n    automatically select slirp backend if available,\r\n    then pcap backend if available. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved handling of Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break for shell-\r\n    based DOS programs. (Wengier)\r\n  - Setting \"irq\" to \"0\" in [sblaster] section of the\r\n    config file will use the default IRQ number for the\r\n    sound card type. Also fixed \"irq=-1\", \"dma=-1\" and\r\n    \"hdma=-1\" not working as desired. (Wengier)\r\n  - Option \"dpi aware=auto\" now defaults to \"true\" when\r\n    full-screen mode is requested when DOSBox-X starts\r\n    in Windows SDL1 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - The return value of AL in Int21/AX=0Eh is no longer\r\n    fixed. The game Jurassic Park may run after moving\r\n    Z drive to a different letter (e.g. E:). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Change current floppy image...\" and \"Change\r\n    current CD image...\" menu options to change the\r\n    currently active floppy disk image(s) on drive A: &\r\n    B: and ISO/CUE image(s) on CD drives respectively.\r\n    This makes it possible to change the active floppy\r\n    disk and/or CD images while a guest system (e.g.\r\n    Windows 9x) is currently running. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Restart DOSBox-X with config file...\" menu\r\n    option to start DOSBox-X with the specified config\r\n    file automatically from the menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Refresh rate...\" menu option (under \"Video\")\r\n    to set the video refresh rate. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Enable A20 gate\" menu option (under \"DOS\")\r\n    to enable or disable the A20 gate. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"maximize\" config option in [sdl] section to\r\n    automatically maximize the DOSBox-X window at start\r\n    (SDL2 and Windows SDL1 builds only). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"allow lmsw to exit protected mode\" config\r\n    option in [cpu] section to control whether the LMSW\r\n    instruction allows the guest to clear the PE bit\r\n    (leave protected mode).\r\n  - Added \"debuggerrun\" config option in [log] section\r\n    to set the run mode when DOSBox-X Debugger starts.\r\n    You can now also switch them from the menu (\"Debug\"\r\n    => \"Debugger option: ...\"), including \"debugger\",\r\n    \"normal\" and \"watch\", the later two corresponding\r\n    to debugger commands \"RUN\" and \"RUNWATCH\". Also,\r\n    the built-in DEBUGBOX command without a parameter\r\n    will start the DOSBox-X debugger. (Wengier)\r\n  - Debugger interface now accepts the '0' key as a\r\n    command to single-step in case F11 isn't an option.\r\n    If you are using XFCE's Terminal emulator, this is\r\n    helpful because Terminal app takes F11 for itself.\r\n  - \"Debug\" menu is now a top-level menu for debugging\r\n    builds (for non-debugging builds there is \"Logging\r\n    console\" menu group under \"Help\"). Also added more\r\n    debug options including \"Generate NMI interrupt\"\r\n    and \"Hook INT 2Fh calls\" under this menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed /S and /F option (date/time-synchronization\r\n    ON/OFF) of DATE command not working. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed aspect=true not working properly for some\r\n    screen modes such as machine=ega. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the mouse not automatically captured when\r\n    DOSBox-X starts with the settings fullscreen=true\r\n    and autolock=true. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed inputs in the Configuration Tool when the\r\n    Configuration Tool is scaled. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed keys may not work after loading a saved state\r\n    for the game Buck Rogers. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed Windows detection for the game \"Tex Murphy:\r\n    Under a Killing Moon\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed serial ports 5-9 may not be usable with real\r\n    serial ports (directserial). (vkbaf & Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed issues related to screen dimensions in TTF\r\n    output in CGA/EGA modes since 0.83.12. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added alternative Windows installer for administrative\r\n    install mode on Windows Vista or later. (Wengier)\r\n  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich)\r\n    - r4443: Improve detection of Paradise SVGA in some\r\n    installers with additional signature.\r\n    - r4453: Improve bittest instructions to wrap more\r\n    correctly. \r\n    - r4454: Enable A20 routines in BIOS.\r\n    - r4456: The numeric keypad can now be used to\r\n    navigate the debugger when Num Lock is off.\r\n0.83.13\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.13.html\r\n  - DOSBox-X can now resolve file paths in its config\r\n    options that include environment variables on non-\r\n    Windows platforms (e.g. ${HOME}..) as well. A new\r\n    config option \"resolve config path\" (in [dosbox]\r\n    section) is added to control path resolving in the\r\n    config file (e.g. to resolve tildes only by setting\r\n    to \"tilde\", or disable all path resolving). (Wengier)\r\n  - System menu text in Windows builds now match the text\r\n    in the drop-down menus to be translatable by language\r\n    files and is compatible with Unicode. (Wengier)\r\n  - The error \"Access Denied\" is returned instead of\r\n    \"File not found\" for files opened exclusively in\r\n    another program on mounted local drives. (Wengier)\r\n  - S386C928 hardware cursor fixed to divide X coordinate\r\n    by bytes per pixel indicated in the control register\r\n    to match apparent Windows 3.1/95 behavior. Cursor\r\n    now tracks host properly even in highcolor/truecolor\r\n    modes.\r\n  - Added support for the RetroWave OPL3 hardware player.\r\n    Set \"oplemu=retrowave_opl3\" in [sblaster] section of\r\n    the config file to use it. Config options including\r\n    \"retrowave_bus\", \"retrowave_spi_cs\", \"retrowave_port\"\r\n    are added to adjust its settings. (ClassicOldSong)\r\n  - Added support for S386C928 hardware cursor color\r\n    selection in 256-color mode, which is different\r\n    from later cards.\r\n  - S3 XGA \"BYTE SWP\" fixed only to byte swap if the\r\n    transfer is 16-bit wide. This fixes the dither\r\n    pattern drawn by Windows 95/98 when you select\r\n    \"Shutdown\" from the Start menu.\r\n  - IMGMAKE command is now disabled in the secure mode,\r\n    similar to commands like IMGMOUNT. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config options \"working directory option\" and\r\n    \"working directory default\" in [dosbox] section of\r\n    the config file to provide various options for the\r\n    users to control DOSBox-X's working directory. For\r\n    example, DOSBox-X can use the primary config file\r\n    directory or the DOSBox-X program directory as its\r\n    working directory. You can view the DOSBox-X'safe\r\n    working directory with CONFIG -L command. DOSBox-X\r\n    is also able to save the working directory that a\r\n    user selects to global config files. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now also try to read the config file\r\n    named dosbox-x.conf in the user config directory\r\n    when searching for config files at start.\r\n  - Added new command-line options -promptfolder and\r\n    -nopromptfolder which will cause the folder prompt\r\n    dialogs to show or not to show at startup.\r\n  - Mac OS X builds will prompt the user to select a\r\n    folder at startup if run from the Finder (or from\r\n    the root directory). The folder selected will then\r\n    become the current working directory of DOSBox-X.\r\n    This makes it possible to start DOSBox-X with a\r\n    config file of your choice and to control where\r\n    the capture, save states and other files go.\r\n  - Fixed Tseng ET4000 640x480 256-color SVGA mode\r\n    when using the ET4000.BIN VGA BIOS, or Windows 98.\r\n  - Added segment limit checks in Normal core for\r\n    MOVSB/MOVSW/MOVSD and STOSB/STOSW/STOSD, which is\r\n    needed for DOSBox-X to work with the Windows 3.1\r\n    S3 86C928 display drivers that use segment limit\r\n    exceptions to fake a linear framebuffer.\r\n  - Added S3 XGA \"byte swap\" emulation, needed for\r\n    correct menu/titlebar display in Windows 3.1 when\r\n    using the S3 86C928 driver.\r\n  - Added YUV (YUY2) overlay to S3 Trio64V+ card\r\n    emulation. Tested with XingMPEG under Windows 3.1\r\n    and ActiveMovie under Windows 98.\r\n  - Added machine types for 5 different variations of\r\n    S3 chipset: Vision864, Vision868, Trio32, Trio64,\r\n    and (experimental) Trio64V+, ViRGE, ViRGE/VX, and\r\n    S3 86C928.\r\n  - Removed second PCI BAR for S3 MMIO register space.\r\n    S3 datasheets do not show a second BAR. Windows 95\r\n    is perfectly happy without it.\r\n  - S3 SVGA XGA emulation BlitRect now supports\r\n    COLOR_CMP. DirectX-based Windows 95 games are now\r\n    able to blit in 256-color mode with a transparent\r\n    color key value.\r\n  - ANSI.SYS emulation now supports the \"Device Status\r\n    Report\" escape when asked through code 6 (report\r\n    cursor position)\r\n  - Fixed RAM mapping bugs related to MDA/CGA/Hercules\r\n    emulation and the \"allow more than 640kb\" option,\r\n    that failed to map RAM as expected, and because of\r\n    that, easily triggered a \"corrupt MCB chain\" error\r\n    message.\r\n  - Worked around the mounting issue for disk or CD\r\n    image files with LaunchBox, by allowing a mounting\r\n    command-line with single quotes like IMGMOUNT D\r\n    'X:\\FILES\\DOS.IMG' on Windows systems. (Wengier)\r\n  - Restored Pentium MMX emulation code for the dynamic\r\n    x86 core to that of version 0.83.11 for better\r\n    compatibility with some Windows 9x games. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"compresssaveparts\" config option (in the\r\n    [dosbox] section) which when set to false will not\r\n    compress the components in saved states. (Wengier)\r\n  - When the current reported DOS version is less than\r\n    7.x and the user tries to mount a LBA or FAT32 disk\r\n    image, DOSBox-X will now show a message to ask if\r\n    the user wants it to set the required DOS version\r\n    automatically and proceed. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now show the folder mounted after\r\n    mounting to a drive from the menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed MOUNT and IMGMOUNT commands unable to mount\r\n    directories or image files that contain non-ASCII\r\n    characters in the code page on Windows. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed CapsLock may not work properly in Windows\r\n    SDL1 builds when -fs option is used. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the cycle information on the title bar when\r\n    the Turbo mode is enabled. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed that some games using the DOS4GW Extender\r\n    may not work due to swap file issue. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed that the clipboard copy and paste may not\r\n    work when the current code page is 808 or 872\r\n    and you are using Windows. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the handling of the \"Save & Restart\" button\r\n    in Configuration Tool when using Direct3D output\r\n    in Windows SDL2 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed incorrect display issue when using TrueType\r\n    font (TTF) output with customized screen dimension\r\n    when fastbioslogo=true is set. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed CD audio not looping for individual tracks\r\n    in games like Alien Trilogy. (kcgen)\r\n  - The command \"MIXER /LISTMIDI\" now lists the ROM\r\n    directory/files and sound fonts for MT32, Synth\r\n    and FluidSynth MIDI device when active. (Wengier)\r\n  - Debugger \"DOS XMS\" command will only list handles\r\n    that are allocated, or with nonzero address or\r\n    nonzero size, to avoid showing irrelevant\r\n    information. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Added LOADFIX -EMS option to allocate/free\r\n    EMS (expanded memory). (joncampbell123)\r\n  - LOADFIX -D -XMS will free all XMS blocks\r\n    allocated by LOADFIX -XMS. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - LOADFIX -A will not allocate memory unless there\r\n    is memory below 64KB to fill. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - INT 15h PS/2 mouse functions now clear pending\r\n    PS/2 mouse interrupt as part of the BIOS call.\r\n    This should resolve unresponsive mouse issues\r\n    with Windows 3.1. (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Add config option \"mt32.model\" in the [midi]\r\n    section to force a MT-32 model to use. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated the MUNT MT-32 library to the latest\r\n    version 2.5.0. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated FLAC decoder library to the latest version\r\n    (0.12.29 by David Reid). (Wengier)\r\n  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich)\r\n    - r4436, r4437: Rewrite store integer instructions\r\n    to check if the result fits.(vogons 78127)\r\n    - r4447: Attribute Controller port alias on EGA\r\n    machine. Fixes EGA display of older Super Pac-Man\r\n    release.\r\n0.83.12\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.12.html\r\n  - Tandy graphics emulation fixed to accept 8 bits\r\n    for vertical total and vertical display CRTC\r\n    registers, which is needed for the tweaked\r\n    graphics mode used by Math Rabbit to display\r\n    correctly.\r\n  - INT 10h will no longer fill in three fields in\r\n    the BIOS data area (video CTL, char height, and\r\n    video switches) unless the machine type is\r\n    EGA or VGA. Those fields do not exist otherwise.\r\n    Certain games like Mindscape's \"Road Runner\" game\r\n    require those fields to be zero as part of its\r\n    Tandy detection routine.\r\n  - PCjr mode will omit the reserved graphics RAM\r\n    MCB block, and will subtract 16KB from the top\r\n    at the BIOS level, if emulating 128KB system\r\n    memory or less.\r\n  - You can now run PCjr mode with as little as\r\n    128KB of RAM. Removed 256KB minimum check from\r\n    DOS kernel. Certain games (Mickey's Space\r\n    Adventure) require memsizekb=128 and memsize=0\r\n    in PCjr mode or else it will not work correctly\r\n    due to how the game locates video system memory.\r\n  - Fixed Tandy mode to place video memory at the\r\n    top of conventional memory and allow running\r\n    Tandy mode with a memsizekb setting as low as\r\n    64KB, though 256KB or higher is recommended.\r\n  - Added Tandy \"real memory size\" field in the\r\n    BIOS data area.\r\n  - Tandy emulation updated to subtract 16KB from\r\n    top of conventional memory, which fixes some\r\n    games and follows DOSBox SVN behavior and real\r\n    hardware according to others on the Vogons forums.\r\n  - Fixed bug that limited Tandy mode to 624KB of\r\n    conventional memory. 32KB of video RAM is taken\r\n    from top of memory, losing half of the 32KB\r\n    breaks games that write to the system RAM instead\r\n    of B800:0000 segment and causes half the graphics\r\n    to not render.\r\n  - CD-ROM image emulation now supports ISO images\r\n    that are 2GB or larger, 32-bit integer size limit\r\n    has been lifted.\r\n  - Increased upper limit of \"prebuffer\" config option\r\n    (in [mixer] section) from 100 to 250. It is still\r\n    recommended to set a value less than 100. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added scrollbar buttons to the Configuration Tool,\r\n    so that the scrollbars better resemble the style of\r\n    the Windows 3.1 scrollbars.\r\n  - The help window for the Configuration Tool will now\r\n    display possible and default values for the config\r\n    options in addition to the descriptions. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated the MMX patch code by kekko. (Wengier)\r\n  - MIXER command now supports the /GUI option to show\r\n    a popup window to display the mixer information.\r\n    Also improved its /LISTMIDI option which will show\r\n    the name of the current MIDI handler and you can\r\n    optionally specify a MIDI handler name (win32/alsa)\r\n    to show the information for this handler. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved the compatibility of AUTOTYPE command with\r\n    games like Asterix & Obelix. (Wengier)\r\n  - The config options ttf.wpbg, ttf.bold, ttf.italic,\r\n    ttf.underline, ttf.strikeout, and ttf.char512 can\r\n    now be modified dynamically with CONFIG -SET ...\r\n    commands, e.g. CONFIG -SET ttf.wpbg=2. (Wengier)\r\n  - The minimal value for the ttf.ptsize config option\r\n    has been decreased from 10 to 9. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu item \"Save logging as...\" (under \"Help\"\r\n    -> \"Debugging options\") to save the current logging\r\n    content to the specified file. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added slirp backend support for the NE2000 network\r\n    feature (in addition to the existing pcap backend).\r\n    There are config sections named [ethernet, slirp]\r\n    and [ethernet, pcap] now to set the options for the\r\n    slirp and pcap backends respectively. Please refer\r\n    to the networking guide in the DOSBox-X Wiki for\r\n    more information about the backends. (Jookia)\r\n  - FAT driver can now support PC-98 HDI images with\r\n    partitions that start at any physical sector even\r\n    if the start is not a multiple of the ratio of\r\n    logical to physical sector size. This allows the\r\n    HDI image of Dragon Knight 4 to mount.\r\n  - Control character 7 (BEEP) is now allowed while\r\n    executing batch files without warnings. (Wengier)\r\n  - With the setting \"core=auto\" DOSBox-X now updates\r\n    the menu in the \"CPU core\" menu group automatically\r\n    between \"Normal core\" and \"Dynamic core\" to reflect\r\n    the CPU core which is currently in use. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed Windows 95/98 installation failures caused by\r\n    FAT driver and DOS API changes in previous version.\r\n  - Fixed well-intended but erroneous fall through case\r\n    in the INT15 handler that prevented 3rd party mouse\r\n    drivers from detecting the PS/2 mouse.\r\n  - Fixed the color issue with the Configuration Tool\r\n    in the macOS SDL1 build. (ant_222)\r\n  - Fixed switching ttf.cols, ttf.lins, and ttf.font\r\n    options dynamically in full-screen mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed menu options \"Increase TTF font size\" and\r\n    \"Decrease TTF font size\" (both under \"Video\" =>\r\n    \"TTF options\") not working (but keyboard shortcuts\r\n    and those in the system menu work). (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed setting option \"ttf.wp=xy3\" or \"ttf.wp=xy4\"\r\n    not working (but \"ttf.wp=xy\" did work). (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed preview function in WordStar not working for\r\n    TrueType font output in previous version. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the issue that caused Windows 3.x group file\r\n    corruption on hard disk image files. (SnikoLoft)\r\n  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich)\r\n    - r4416: Added ability to start and stop avi\r\n    recording, and to start keymapper, from config.\r\n    - r4405: Smarter clearing of the dynrec cache.\r\n0.83.11\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.11.html\r\n  - Added support for the clipboard device (CLIP$) and\r\n    DOS clipboard API on non-Windows systems (they were\r\n    previously only supported on the Windows platform).\r\n    In Linux SDL1 build only read access is supported\r\n    whereas both read and write access are supported in\r\n    all other builds. Also, selecting and copying text\r\n    to the host clipboard using a mouse button or arrow\r\n    key is now supported in macOS SDL1 build. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Paste Clipboard\" button to the AUTOEXEC.BAT,\r\n    CONFIG.SYS and 4DOS.INI sections in Configuration\r\n    Tool for pasting clipboard contents. (Wengier)\r\n  - Windows SDL2 builds now use same clipboard pasting\r\n    method as Windows SDL1 builds by default instead of\r\n    the BIOS keyboard function. The method is now also\r\n    available for Linux and macOS (both SDL1 and SDL2)\r\n    builds (although it is disabled by default on these\r\n    platforms). A menu option \"Use BIOS function for\r\n    keyboard pasting\" is added to the \"Shared clipboard\r\n    functions\" menu group (under \"Main\") to use BIOS\r\n    function for the clipboard pasting instead of the\r\n    keystroke method. Make sure this option is disabled\r\n    if pasting clipboard text into Windows 3.x/9x apps\r\n    (e.g. Notepad & Write) is desired. This setting can\r\n    be changed with \"clip_paste_bios\" config option in\r\n    in [sdl] section of the config file too. (Wengier)\r\n  - With the config option \"startcmd=true\" or command-\r\n    line option -winrun, Windows applications can now\r\n    be launched from within a DOS program or from the\r\n    4DOS shell in addition to built-in shell. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added the \"disable graphical splash\" config option\r\n    in [dosbox] section which when set will cause a\r\n    text-mode BIOS splash screen to be always displayed\r\n    at startup instead of the graphical one. If the\r\n    TrueType font (TTF) output is enabled the text-\r\n    mode BIOS screen is used automatically. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added a simple BIOS Setup Utility, which will show\r\n    a summary of the current system configuration and\r\n    allow users to change the date and time. Press Del\r\n    key at the BIOS boot screen to enter. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"showbasic\" in [sdl] section\r\n    which when set to false will hide DOSBox-X version\r\n    number and running speed in the titlebar. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added experimental option to load a VGA BIOS ROM\r\n    image and execute it, instead of our own INT 10h\r\n    emulation. If enabled, it will load the specific\r\n    ROM file into C000:0000. If not specified, it\r\n    will choose based on machine type. VGA BIOS ROM\r\n    images (e.g. et4000.bin for Tseng ET4000 emulation)\r\n    can be dumped from real hardware or downloaded from\r\n    the PCem ROMs collection. It can be set with config\r\n    option \"vga bios rom image\" in [video] section.\r\n  - Improved handling for file- and record-locking\r\n    for non-Windows platforms. Portions of the code\r\n    are adopted from DOSEmu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved handling for the setting \"ansi.sys=false\",\r\n    such as fixing the welcome screen messup in this\r\n    case and allowing the use of a custom ANSI TSR\r\n    (such as NNANSI.COM) instead. (Wengier & stu)\r\n  - You can now press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break to break\r\n    from long outputs from commands like TYPE, MORE,\r\n    COPY, DIR /S, and ATTRIB /S. (Wengier)\r\n  - Renamed MEM.COM to MEM.EXE to match DOS. (Wengier)\r\n  - Rewrote built-in TREE command instead of the one\r\n    from FreeDOS to support long filenames. (Wengier)\r\n  - DELTREE is now an external command appearing on\r\n    drive Z: as DELTREE.EXE instead of a builtin shell\r\n    command, since it is an external command in a real\r\n    DOS system. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added REPLACE command to replace files, resembling\r\n    the MS-DOS counterpart. This command is compiled\r\n    with long filename support. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added PUSHD and POPD commands so that you can store\r\n    the current directory and changes to the specified\r\n    directory (optionally also the current drive), then\r\n    changes the directory/drive back. PUSHD command\r\n    without arguments show stored path(s). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added COLOR command to change current foreground\r\n    and background colors. It usage is similar to the\r\n    same-named command in the Windows command prompt.\r\n    For example, command \"COLOR fc\" produces light red\r\n    on bright white; COLOR without an argument restores\r\n    the original color. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added CHCP command to view the current code page,\r\n    or change the current code page for the TrueType\r\n    font (TTF) output. Supported code pages include:\r\n    437, 808, 850, 852, 853, 855, 857, 858, 860, 861,\r\n    862, 863, 864, 865, 866, 869, 872, and 874. You can\r\n    now also set the code page for TTF output via the\r\n    optional second parameter of the \"country\" option\r\n    in [config] section of the configuration. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added function to automatically save states in the\r\n    specified time interval (in seconds). You can also\r\n    specify a save slot or start and end save slots to\r\n    be used. For example, \"autosave=10 11-20\" will set\r\n    a 10-second time interval for auto-saving, and the\r\n    save slots used will be between 11 and 20. If no\r\n    save slot is specified, then the current save slot\r\n    will be used for auto-saving. Putting a minus sign\r\n    before time interval causes the auto-saving function\r\n    to not be activated at start. You can optionally\r\n    also specify up to 9 program names for this feature,\r\n    e.g. \"autosave=10 11-20 EDIT:21-30 EDITOR:35\" will\r\n    cause program \"EDIT\" to use save slots 21-30, and\r\n    \"EDITOR\" to use save slot 35, and other programs to\r\n    use save slots 11-20. Added a menu option \"Auto-save\r\n    settings...\" to manage the auto-saving feature at\r\n    run-time. A menu option \"Enable auto-saving state\"\r\n    is added to the \"Save/load options\" menu group under\r\n    \"Capture\" to toggle auto-saving when the function is\r\n    enabled. Likewise, a menu option \"Select last auto-\r\n    saved slot\" is added to the \"Select save slot\" menu\r\n    group (also under \"Capture\") to switch to the last\r\n    auto-saved slot (if any). (Wengier)\r\n  - The Configuration Tool windows are now scalable, so\r\n    that they will no longer look very small in e.g.\r\n    full-screen or High DPI modes. (ant_222)\r\n  - If the -defaultdir option is the only or the last\r\n    command-line option and no parameter is specified,\r\n    then directory of the primary config file (if any)\r\n    becomes the DOSBox-X default directory. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now change the current output dynamically\r\n    with CONFIG command, e.g. \"CONFIG -set output=ttf\"\r\n    and \"CONFIG -set output=default\". (Wengier)\r\n  - The command \"KEYB US\" will return the DOS codepage\r\n    to 437 if current codepage is different. (Wengier)\r\n  - The setting \"output=default\" will enable the OpenGL\r\n    output for Linux systems if possible. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the CGA/MCGA/MDA/Hercules-specific shortcut\r\n    function buttons in Mapper Editor, and the screen\r\n    colors after exiting from Mapper Editor when using\r\n    these machine types in Direct3D output (SDL1 build).\r\n    Also fixed the messages in the welcome banner for\r\n    these machine types to inform users the new default\r\n    shortcuts (Ctrl(+Shift)+[F7/F8]). (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed DOS Int21/AH=0x5a \"Create temporary file\"\r\n    function not generating unique files. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed that the current drive goes back to Z drive\r\n    when combined unmounts & mounts are used. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed PC-98 keyboard handling of CTRL+A through\r\n    CTRL+Z. CTRL+C now works correctly in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - Fixed crash of Free Pascal compiler with dynamic\r\n    core and setting \"use dynamic core with paging on =\r\n    auto\" introduced in the previous version. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed launching Windows programs when the working\r\n    directory has no 8.3 filename entry. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed issues with full-screen switch in some cases\r\n    when the TrueType font output is enabled. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed an issue in MinGW builds that no data will be\r\n    sent to the OPL3Duo board. (DhrBaksteen)\r\n  - Fixed screen flickering when hovering over the menu\r\n    with Direct3D output in the Windows SDL2 build that\r\n    was introduced in the last version. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed mounting disk/CD images with long paths from\r\n    the \"Drive\" menu may not work properly. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed that the \"Save\" button in Configuration Tool\r\n    did not save config file in last version. (Wengier)\r\n  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich)\r\n    - r4346: Fix a long-standing crash that occurred\r\n    when disconnecting a second joystick after\r\n    partially mapping it.\r\n    - r4344: Add F8 to toggle printable characters on\r\n    and off in the debugger.\r\n    - r4340: Fix behavior when main memory allocation\r\n    fails.\r\n    - r4336: Correct an oversight of r4186 when floppy\r\n    disks are mounted.\r\n    - r4330: some big endian improvements and drive_fat\r\n    fixes. (jmarsh)\r\n    - r4320: Report Q-Channel track number in BCD,\r\n    meaning it is not converted to binary by the\r\n    CD-ROM device driver. Fixes the CD-Player feature\r\n    of DOS Navigator 1.51 when playing past track 15.\r\n    - r4318: Add LOGC debug command to log cs:ip only.\r\n0.83.10\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.10.html\r\n  - The Windows key(s) in Windows and the Command key(s)\r\n    in macOS will now be displayed as the \"Windows\" and\r\n    \"Command\" keys instead of the \"super\" and the \"meta\"\r\n    keys in SDL1 builds just like SDL2 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Cursor blinking rate for TrueType font (TTF) output\r\n    can now be customized with the ttf.blinkc option.\r\n    Set an integer between 1 (fastest) and 7 (slowest)\r\n    to change TTF cursor blinking rate, or setting it to\r\n    0 for no cursor (or false for non-blinking cursor as\r\n    in previous versions), with the default value being\r\n    6 on PC-98 systems and 4 elsewhere. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed parallel port emulation to allow MDA port 3BCh\r\n    to work properly.\r\n  - Enhanced the printer function on Windows platforms\r\n    to allow printer names to be specified in [printer]\r\n    section via the \"device\" option for direct printing\r\n    to the selected device. If left empty, then Windows\r\n    Print dialog will always be shown, or specifying \"-\"\r\n    will cause it to show only once (unless the user\r\n    clicks \"Cancel\"). Under \"Help\" menu there is now a\r\n    menu option \"List Printer Devices\" to list printer\r\n    devices on Windows, and the parallel port LPT1 now\r\n    defaults to the printer on all platforms. (Wengier)\r\n  - The dynamic_x86 CPU core can now handle page faults\r\n    non-recursively, so you can now run the dynamic_x86\r\n    core with Windows 9x/ME without crashes, although\r\n    this may slightly decrease the performance, and it\r\n    may be disabled by setting the config option \"use\r\n    dynamic core with paging on\" in [cpu] section to\r\n    \"false\"; the default value of this option has been\r\n    changed to \"auto\" which will enable/disable itself\r\n    based on whether the 386 paging and a guest system\r\n    has been enabled. Also fixed incorrect behavior for\r\n    handling trap flags in the dynamic core and updated\r\n    the MMX code for improved performance. (koolkdev)\r\n  - Added support for Direct3D output on Windows SDL2\r\n    builds just like Windows SDL1 builds to become the\r\n    default output in all Windows builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X now natively supports the pixel-perfect\r\n    scaling! Set the option \"output=openglpp\" in [sdl]\r\n    section of the config file to enable this output.\r\n    Alternatively, the output can be selected from the\r\n    menu (\"Video\" => \"Output\" => \"OpenGL perfect\") at\r\n    run-time. It is recommended to set config options\r\n    and \"aspect=true\" (whenever the emulated display\r\n    has an aspect ratio of 4:3) and \"doublescan=false\"\r\n    for openglpp output. Also, with high DPI displays\r\n    (e.g. on Windows 7+ with DPI scaling enabled) it\r\n    works better with full-screen mode and the setting\r\n    \"dpi aware=true\". It was implemented by ant_222\r\n    (patch author) with some code cleanups by Wengier.\r\n  - Updated the Windows installer to add a page for\r\n    new users to select a video system output to use -\r\n    the default output (Direct3D), OpenGL with pixel-\r\n    perfect scaling (openglpp or \"OpenGL perfect\") for\r\n    improved image quality, and the TrueType font (TTF)\r\n    output for text-mode DOS applications. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now supply a ZIP/7Z file as a parameter to\r\n    DOSBox-X directly so that it will be mounted as C:\r\n    drive when DOSBox-X starts. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added overlay support for mounting PhysFS drives\r\n    so that you can specify a write location when you\r\n    mounted a ZIP/7Z archive by adopting an old patch.\r\n    For example, command \"MOUNT C C:\\DIR -T OVERLAY\"\r\n    will specify path C:\\DIR(\\C_DRIVE) as the write\r\n    location after mounting C: drive as a PhysFS drive\r\n    with a command like \"MOUNT FILES.ZIP\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Added ability to resolve file paths that include\r\n    environment variables on Windows or tildes (~) on\r\n    other platforms for various options in the config\r\n    file, such as language and mapper file paths, MT32\r\n    ROM & FluidSynth soundfont paths, [config] section\r\n    options as well as file outputs for the printing\r\n    and serial/parallel port functions. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added calculator for DOS (EVAL.EXE), which appears\r\n    on Z drive and can calculate both simple (such as\r\n    sin(0) and cos(0)) and many advanced mathematical\r\n    expressions in either command-line mode and or the\r\n    interactive mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for standard (VGA/EGA/CGA) and mono\r\n    mode dual-screen setup by porting the patch. You\r\n    can now start DOSBox-X with the option -display2\r\n    followed by a color (white, green, amber) to enable\r\n    this feature on debug builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now translate texts in DOSBox-X's drop-down\r\n    menus. The message files as written by the config\r\n    tool (CLI or GUI) will contain the menu texts for\r\n    translations from the English language. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"file access tries\" config option (in [dos]\r\n    section) so that if a positive integer is provided\r\n    (e.g. 1 or 3) DOSBox-X will try to read/write/lock\r\n    files on mounted local drives for the specified\r\n    number of times before failing on Windows builds.\r\n    It is especially useful for networked DOS database\r\n    applications that require record locking. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"bannercolortheme\" config option (in [dosbox]\r\n    section) so that users can change the background\r\n    color theme of the welcome banner from the default\r\n    blue color when DOSBox-X starts. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"pcaptimeout\" config option (in the [ne2000]\r\n    section) to specify a read timeout value for pcap\r\n    in milliseconds, or default value (-1 on Windows\r\n    or 3000 otherwise) will be used. (Wengier & Jookia)\r\n  - Added \"Save & Restart\" button to the Configuration\r\n    Tool's \"Save\" option for saving the config file and\r\n    then automatically restarting DOSBox-X with this\r\n    saved configuration. Command-line options -wcboot,\r\n    -wcdboot and -wcpboot are added to CONFIG command\r\n    which resemble -wc, -wcd, and -wcp options but will\r\n    reboot DOSBox-X after writing configfile. Command-\r\n    line option -bc (-bootconf) is also added to reboot\r\n    with specified config file (or the primary loaded\r\n    config file if not specified) directly. (Wengier)\r\n  - The config option ttf.font will now search for TTF\r\n    fonts in the directory as specified by the fontpath\r\n    option in [printer] section too. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added special properties to CONFIG command such as\r\n    \"screenwidth\", \"screenheight\", \"windowwidth\", and\r\n    \"windowheight\" so that commands like \"CONFIG -GET\r\n    screenwidth\" and \"CONFIG -GET screenheight\" will\r\n    get the current screen width and height. (Wengier)\r\n  - BOOT command without a parameter will now try to\r\n    boot the current drive if possible. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now change properties such as \"fullscreen\",\r\n    \"glshader\" and \"windowposition\" dynamically with\r\n    CONFIG command. For example, command \"config -set\r\n    fullscreen=true\" and \"config -set windowposition=\"\r\n    will now switch on the full-screen mode and center\r\n    the window position respectively. For TrueType font\r\n    output, you can now also change the TTF font, the\r\n    number of rows and columns on the TTF screen, and\r\n    the word processor for TTF dynamically using CONFIG\r\n    command, e.g. \"config -set ttf.font=test\", \"config\r\n    -set ttf.lins=30\", \"config -set ttf.cols=100\" and\r\n    \"config -set ttf.wp=wp\". The limits for the options\r\n    ttf.cols and ttf.lins are increased too. (Wengier)\r\n  - Implemented the DOS network redirector functions so\r\n    that the host name can be reported to DOS programs,\r\n    unless the secure mode is enabled. You may need to\r\n    set either the option ipx=true in [ipx] section or\r\n    the option ne2000=true in [ne2000] section. Also\r\n    added config option \"network redirector\" to [dos]\r\n    section which if set to false disables the network\r\n    redirector even with IPX/NE2000 enabled. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed an issue that the DOSBox-X window size may be\r\n    incorrect when restoring from a maximized window in\r\n    the SDL2 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed that the menu option \"Select OpenGL (GLSL)\r\n    shader..\" not working properly sometimes. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed Ctrl+C not working in GNU ed. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed large ISO images (>2GB) unable to be mounted\r\n    using IMGMOUNT command. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed build failure on Gentoo Linux. (fonic)\r\n  - 3dfx games can now work with the Glide passthrough\r\n    feature when a guest system (guest DOS or Windows\r\n    9x) is currently running. The default setting for\r\n    config option \"keep private area on boot\" in [dos]\r\n    section is changed from \"false\" to \"auto\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved the speed of the Voodoo hardware emulation\r\n    for running games like Tomb Raider 3dfx. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved OPL3Duo support, such as adding a buffer\r\n    thread to get rid of slowdowns & breakups in audio\r\n    playback when using the board. (DhrBaksteen)\r\n  - Updated the Tiny File Dialog library to the latest\r\n    version v3.8.5, which fixes issues such as the\r\n    compatibility problem with Windows XP. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated FLAC, MP3, and WAV CD-DA decoder libraries\r\n    to the latest versions (0.12.28, 0.6.26 and 0.12.18\r\n    respectively; per David Reid). (Wengier)\r\n  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich & Wengier)\r\n    - r4426: Emulate debug register 6 during trap flag\r\n    emulation (and normal int 1). Fixes 544 (jmarsh)\r\n    - r4401: Improve xchg to handle unwritable memory\r\n    better for core_dyn_x86.\r\n    - r4399: Finish up and add LOOP_NE and LOOP_E for\r\n    core_dyn_x86.\r\n    - r4393: Remove video page check when drawing\r\n    internal mouse pointer, as the BIOS current page\r\n    is not updated in some cases. Fixes QQP games: Lost\r\n    Admiral, Conquered Kingdoms, and Solitaire's\r\n    Journey. Also be a bit smarter about enabling\r\n    autolock, supporting more cases where the mouse\r\n    is used for input without resetting it.\r\n    - r4392: Improve capturing of Zeliard and fix a\r\n    few percussion-related capturing problems as well.\r\n    - r4310: Improve PMAKE on big endian machines and\r\n    fix some bugs. Fixes bug in 16 -> 15 bit color\r\n    conversion.\r\n    - r4309: Copy working directory when mounting an\r\n    overlay.\r\n    - r4307: Refinement of SoundBlaster checks, so no\r\n    IRQ is raised when not in autodma mode.\r\n\r\n0.83.9\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.9.html\r\n  - Physical CD drives are now mountable in SDL2 builds\r\n    just like SDL1 builds, so commands like \"MOUNT -CD\"\r\n    should work in both SDL1 and SDL2 builds. Some code\r\n    is adopted from the SDL2_CDROM library. (Wengier)\r\n  - Implemented file locking support for mounting disk\r\n    image files so that you cannot mount the same disk\r\n    image files in read/write mode at the same time as\r\n    this can cause possible disk corruptions. A config\r\n    option \"locking disk image mount\" is added to the\r\n    [dosbox] section which when set to false (or if the\r\n    user mounts the image files read-only) will bypass\r\n    the locking of image files. Also improved the DOS\r\n    file locking function, which can be disabled by\r\n    setting \"share=false\" in [dos] section. (Wengier)\r\n  - Implemented PhysFS support so that you can mount\r\n    archives (e.g. ZIP/7Z) as drives in read-only mode,\r\n    e.g. \"MOUNT C TEST.ZIP\" or \"MOUNT D FILES.7Z\". Some\r\n    code is ported from a custom DOSBox fork. The menu\r\n    option \"Mount an archive file (ZIP/7Z)\" is added to\r\n    Drive menu to mount archives as Drives. (Wengier)\r\n  - INT 13h now obeys the \"hard drive data rate limit\"\r\n    setting, using the same disk I/O delay code as\r\n    INT 21h file I/O. [Issue #2039]\r\n  - Linux/X11 SDL1 builds: Combine window move/resize\r\n    into one call if possible, and not during window\r\n    manager hints, to avoid resize problems with the\r\n    XFCE 4.14 platform.\r\n  - Added menu option \"Create blank disk images...\"\r\n    (under \"DOS\" menu) to create blank floppy or hard\r\n    disk images of a common disk size, including 360KB,\r\n    400KB, 720KB, 1.2MB, 1.44MB and 2.88MB for floppy\r\n    disk images and 250MB, 520MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB and 8GB\r\n    for hard disk images. The 1GB option (-t hd_1gig)\r\n    is also added to IMGMAKE command. (Wengier)\r\n  - The Configuration Tool will now be centered within\r\n    the DOSBox-X window for a better looking. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"synchronize time\" in [dosbox]\r\n    section which when set to true will allow DOSBox-X\r\n    to automatically synchronize the date and time with\r\n    the host system, unless you manually change date\r\n    and/or time. A menu option \"Synchronize host date/\r\n    time\" is added to the DOS menu. The function uses\r\n    IRQ0 handler; it will not work in PC-98 mode nor if\r\n    the timer isn't running at the standard 18.2Hz tick\r\n    rate, as any other rate does not make sense and\r\n    will cause only jitter and error. Also fixed two\r\n    Demoscene entries sl_fokus and sl_haloo which use\r\n    BIOS_TIMER with a faster hardware tick rate.\r\n  - Added config option \"showdetails\" which when set to\r\n    true enables the menu option \"Show FPS and RT speed\r\n    in title bar\" at start. It is equivalent to -showrt\r\n    and -showcycles command-line options. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved compatibility with Watcom C++ 2.0 when\r\n    long filename (LFN) support is enabled. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for starting DOSBox-X in a specific\r\n    display on a multi-screen setup (Windows builds as\r\n    well as Linux/macOS SDL2 builds). A config option\r\n    \"display\" is added to the [sdl] section that users\r\n    can specify a display for the DOSBox-X window to\r\n    start. The option can be combined with the existing\r\n    \"windowposition\" config option to specify the\r\n    position on the specified display/screen. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now pop up a message box to inform\r\n    the user when a Direct3D pixel shader is loaded\r\n    from the menu on the Windows platform. (Wengier)\r\n  - Extended serial (COM) ports from COM1-COM3 to COM1-\r\n    COM9 in the [serial] section. The config options\r\n    serial4-9 are advanced options. You can optionally\r\n    specify base addresses for any serial ports. When\r\n    the \"file\" option is used, you can additionally\r\n    specify a program to open the file with \"openwith\"\r\n    option. If the specified program cannot be executed\r\n    due to some problem, DOSBox-X will try to start a\r\n    program as specified with the \"openerror\" action,\r\n    or it will show an error. For both serial (COM) and\r\n    parallel (LPT) ports options, the program commands\r\n    can be quoted with double quotes, or with single\r\n    quotes if the \"squote\" option is added. (Wengier)\r\n  - Extended parallel (LPT) ports from LPT1-LPT3 to\r\n    LPT1-LPT9 in the [parallel] section. Config options\r\n    lpt4-9 are advanced config options. You can also\r\n    optionally specify base addresses and IRQs for\r\n    these ports. The parallel1-9 config options are\r\n    enhanced to allow the generated files to be started\r\n    with the specified action: \"openpcl\" to start a\r\n    program to open the file if the print output is\r\n    detected to be PCL; \"openps\" to start a program if\r\n    the print output is detected to be PostScript (PS);\r\n    \"openwith\" to start a program otherwise. If you'd\r\n    like to specify parameters then be sure to properly\r\n    quote the string(s). Furthermore, if any of the\r\n    specified program(s) cannot be executed, DOSBox-X\r\n    will try to start a program as specified with the\r\n    \"openerror\" action, or show an error. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"openwith\" and \"openerror\" config options to\r\n    [printer] section to start the specified program to\r\n    open the printer output file. The [printer] section\r\n    also accepts \"fontdir\" option where you can change\r\n    the path (\"FONTS\" by default) where the printer TTF\r\n    fonts (including courier.ttf, ocra.ttf, roman.ttf,\r\n    sansserif.ttf, script.ttf) are located. If no TTF\r\n    font can be found (either from the custom path or\r\n    system path) for printing, the internal TTF font\r\n    for the TTF output will be used. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added read-only options to the Drive menu to mount\r\n    host folders/drives or image files to the specified\r\n    drive letter in read-only mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now use a single mapper file for both SDL1\r\n    and SDL2 versions of DOSBox-X! The new mapper file\r\n    will be divided to sections [SDL1] and [SDL2] for\r\n    both versions. The mapper file can be specified\r\n    with the mapperfile config option, or you can set\r\n    the mapperfile_sdl1 and mapperfile_sdl2 config\r\n    options to override mapperfile option. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added -defaultmapper command-line option which will\r\n    use default key bindings for the mapper. (Wengier)\r\n  - The menu functions \"Load mapper file\", \"Quick edit\r\n    mode\", \"Stop clipboard pasting\" and \"Display state\r\n    information\" have been added to the key mapper so\r\n    that you can now define your own shortcut keys to\r\n    activate these functions. (Wengier)\r\n  - The default shortcuts for the \"Copy to clipboard\",\r\n    \"Paste from clipboard\", and the \"Reset window size\"\r\n    functions are now Ctrl+F5, Ctrl+F6 and Host(F11/F12)\r\n    +BackSpace respectively. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added ttf.fontbold, ttf.fontital, and ttf.fontboit\r\n    config options so that you can specify actual bold\r\n    italic, and bold-italic TrueType fonts for use with\r\n    the TTF output that will render the bold, italic,\r\n    and bold-italic text styles using the actual TTF\r\n    fonts (e.g. consolab, consolai, consolaz instead of\r\n    consola) instead of making the original TTF font\r\n    bold, italic, bold-italic automatically. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X now supports the use of arrow keys (left,\r\n    right, up, down, home, end) to select and copy text\r\n    to the host clipboard in addition to a mouse button\r\n    (subject to the specified key modifier, or use the\r\n    QuickEdit function). The arrow keys will move the\r\n    selections; press Home key to start the actual text\r\n    selection and End key to end text selection and to\r\n    copy to the clipboard; press ESC key to cancel text\r\n    selection. Set config option \"clip_mouse_button\" to\r\n    \"arrows\" to enable it, or select it from \"Shared\r\n    clipboard functions\" menu group. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now press the key combination Ctrl+Tab in\r\n    the shell to see a list of files/directories that\r\n    can be completed by the Tab completion. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added SETCOLOR command to view or change the text-\r\n    mode color scheme settings. Also fixed the color\r\n    palette for the TTF output. (Wengier)\r\n  - Separated \"TTF options\" menu group that contains\r\n    TrueType font (TTF) related menu options from the\r\n    \"Text-mode\" menu group in \"Video\" menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - The \"Show menu bar\" option now appears in system\r\n    menu of the Windows SDL2 build too. (Wengier)\r\n  - If a language file fails to load, DOSBox-X will now\r\n    show a warning dialog instead of exiting. (Wengier)\r\n  - The option \"clip_key_modifier\" now accepts values\r\n    like \"ctrlalt\", \"ctrlshift\", \"altshift\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed 2D texture not showing for 3dfx games in the\r\n    Glide passthrough mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the mouse sensitivity menu option (under the\r\n    \"DOS\" menu) not working. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the color palette problem when switching to\r\n    graphic mode from mono mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed full-screen TTF output may not fully cover\r\n    the background screen in Linux. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed that lines starting with \"%\" in [autoexec]\r\n    section are being ignored. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed issues with building the code with original\r\n    MinGW using the ./build-mingw script. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed option \"output=ttf\" not working properly with\r\n    -startui/startmapper command-line option. (Wengier)\r\n  - When the mouse is captured, the title bar will show\r\n    the shortcut to release the mouse. (Wengier)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT now assumes the ISO type for .GOG/.INS\r\n    files (which are equivalent to .CUE/.INS files)\r\n    if no type is specified by the user. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved the dynamic core including the way its\r\n    cache is allocated and to support dual mapping.\r\n  - The FREECG98.BMP file (for PC-98 mode) is now\r\n    rendered based on a unifont_jp TTF font instead\r\n    of UnifontFullMediumMono.ttf. (roytam1)\r\n  - Added support for automatic switching from TTF\r\n    output to another output in PC-98 mode, allowing\r\n    Windows 3.1 to run in this mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added OPL3Duo support, which passes OPL3 output\r\n    to an OPL3Duo Arduino board with a specific\r\n    configuration if desired. Set the config option\r\n    \"oplemu=opl3duoboard\" to use it. (josephillips85)\r\n0.83.8\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.8.html\r\n  - Added support for scalable TrueType font (TTF)\r\n    output for text-mode programs. Set \"output=ttf\"\r\n    and optionally a monospaced TTF font (such as\r\n    consola) with config option \"ttf.font\" to use it.\r\n    Lines and columns can be specified with config\r\n    options \"ttf.lins\" and \"ttf.cols\", and the cursor\r\n    can be made blinking with the option \"ttf.blinkc\".\r\n    The config options \"ttf.ptsize\" and \"ttf.winperc\"\r\n    can be used to set the TTF font size and window\r\n    percentage respectively. If you specify a TTF font\r\n    size with \"ttf.ptsize\" then \"ttf.winperc\" will be\r\n    ignored. You can also specify a word processor\r\n    (WP=WordPerfect, WS=WordStar, XY=XyWrite) for the\r\n    on-screen text-style and 512-character font (WP)\r\n    features. When using the TTF output DOSBox-X will\r\n    temporarily switch to a different output when a\r\n    graphical mode is requested (or when trying to take\r\n    a screenshot); the TTF output will be auto-switched\r\n    back later), which can be customized via config\r\n    option \"ttf.outputswitch\" (which defaults to auto).\r\n    Menu items in the \"Text-mode\" menu group (under\r\n    \"Video\" menu) have been expanded to support TTF\r\n    options such as increasing/decreasing the TTF font\r\n    sizes and on-screen text style toggling (including\r\n    bold, italics, underline and strikeout). You can\r\n    also select a TTF font to use at run-time with the\r\n    \"Select TrueType font (TTF)\" menu option. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added the \"Load mapper file...\" menu option (under\r\n    \"Main\") to select and load a DOSBox-X mapper file\r\n    at run-time. Be sure to select a SDL1 mapper file\r\n    for SDL1 builds, and similar for SDL2. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now select a host key from the menu (under\r\n    \"Main\") including Ctrl+Alt, Ctrl+Shift, Alt+Shift,\r\n    or use the mapper-defined host key as in previous\r\n    versions (which default to F11 on Windows and F12\r\n    otherwise). A config option \"hostkey\" is added so\r\n    that you can specify it from config file. (Wengier)\r\n  - Pasting text from the clipboard on macOS SDL1 build\r\n    is now supported like Linux SDL1 build. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for ARM-based Apple M1 MacBook. The\r\n    dynamic core now works on ARM-based macOS systems.\r\n    SDL1 builds updated to use newer audio APIs on the\r\n    macOS platform so that the audio works once again\r\n    when compiled and run on macOS 11 (Big Sur). Prior\r\n    to the change, ancient versions of the API dating\r\n    back to the mid 2000s were used which no longer\r\n    work on Big Sur.\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now look for the config file (i.e.\r\n    dosbox-x.conf/dosbox.conf) and the mapper file in\r\n    the directory containing the DOSBox-X executable\r\n    too if the config or mapper file cannot be found\r\n    in the DOSBox-X working directory. (Wengier)\r\n  - The system menu in Windows SDL1 builds is now also\r\n    available for Windows SDL2 builds, and menu items\r\n    \"Reset font size\", \"Increase TTF font size\" and\r\n    \"Decrease TTF font size\" are added. (Wengier)\r\n  - Enhanced the mapper editor interface to allow more\r\n    keyboard shortcuts to be added, shown in multiple\r\n    pages in the mapper, navigable with the \"Previous\r\n    Page\" and \"Next Page\" buttons. The text in the\r\n    grids are now longer and clearer too. The default\r\n    shortcuts for a few items are changed to use the\r\n    Host key style (e.g. Host+S and Host+L for saving\r\n    and loading states respectively). (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu item \"List network interfaces\" under\r\n    \"Help\" menu to list network interfaces in the host\r\n    system for the NE2000 feature. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu group \"DOS commands\" under \"Help\" menu\r\n    to display the help content for the selected DOS\r\n    shell command (DIR, CD, etc). (Wengier)\r\n  - Configuration Tool now provides the option to save\r\n    to the primary or user config files. (Wengier)\r\n  - Certain config options (e.g. doublescan) that were\r\n    marked as advanced options are now general config\r\n    options and will appear in dosbox-x.reference.conf\r\n    apart from dosbox-x.reference.full.conf. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config options \"saveremark\" (default: true)\r\n    and \"forceloadstate\" (default: false) in [dosbox]\r\n    section which can be used to control if DOSBox-X\r\n    should ask users to enter remarks when saving a\r\n    state or show warnings when loading a saved state\r\n    if there is a mismatch found. (Wengier)\r\n  - The config option \"pixelshader\" is moved from the\r\n    section [gui] to [render] so that it will be in the\r\n    same section as the option \"glshader\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu item \"Select OpenGL (GLSL) shader...\" to\r\n    allow OpenGL shader switch from the menu, just like\r\n    the function for Direct3D pixel shaders. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu item \"Show IDE disk or CD status\" under\r\n    \"DOS\" menu to show the current assignments (disk or\r\n    CD image) of the IDE controllers. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed IDE CD assignment may not be reset when soft\r\n    reboots are activated from guest systems. (Wengier)\r\n  - The program 80x43.COM is added into the ZIP package\r\n    TEXTUTIL.ZIP on the Z drive. You can also change\r\n    current text screen to the 80x43 mode from the menu\r\n    group \"Text-mode\" under \"Video\" menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Enhanced MODE command so that you can change the\r\n    number of columns and lines in the screen with the\r\n    syntax \"MODE CON COLS=c LINES=n\" (c=80 or 132, and\r\n    n=25, 43, 50, or 60). The command \"MODE CON\" will\r\n    show the current number of columns and lines in the\r\n    screen as in a real DOS system. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added FLAGSAVE command for the save state feature\r\n    to flag (mark) one or more files to be saved and\r\n    loaded. Type \"FLAGSAVE /?\" for more information on\r\n    this command. (PogoMan361 and Wengier)\r\n  - Enhanced A20GATE command to show the current status\r\n    of the A20 gate when no parameter is given, along\r\n    with other small improvements. (Wengier)\r\n  - INT 21h DOS=HMA emulation, to enable the A20 gate,\r\n    and autoa20fix, to disable the A20 gate, now checks\r\n    whether the CPU is running in virtual 8086 mode.\r\n    If vm86 detected, the code will control the A20\r\n    gate by calling the XMS interface instead of direct\r\n    reading/writing via port 92h. This consideration\r\n    is required for autoa20fix to cooperate with\r\n    Microsoft Windows 3.1. Note that Windows 3.1 does\r\n    not virtualize port 92h. If it did, this workaround\r\n    would not be necessary.\r\n  - Added -a option to LOADFIX command which will auto\r\n    allocate enough memory to fill lowest 64KB memory\r\n    instead of using exactly 64KB memory. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added autofixwarning option (true by default) which\r\n    allows user to silence the messages when DOSBox-X\r\n    tries to auto-fix \"Packed file is corrupt\" error\r\n    when running a program with this issue. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added autoa20fix option (enabled by default). This\r\n    option when enabled attempts to resolve EXEPACK\r\n    \"Packed file is corrupt\" errors by temporarily\r\n    disabling the A20 gate and running the program\r\n    again. This may provide better support for affected\r\n    DOS applications than the LOADFIX option. If both\r\n    autoa20fix and autoloadfix are set, then autoa20fix\r\n    will be tried first, and if it did not work then\r\n    autoloadfix will be tried next.\r\n  - The autoloadfix config option changed to allocate\r\n    only enough memory to keep the executable above the\r\n    64KB boundary, instead of blindly allocating 64KB.\r\n  - Fixed menu items \"Rescan drive\" and \"Swap disk\" in\r\n    \"Drive\" menu being reversed. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed CD audio issue with the game \"The Secret of\r\n    Monkey Island\" when talking to the pirate in Scumm\r\n    Bar by adapting the patch that fixes it. Thanks\r\n    kcgen for the fix logic. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for MAME CHD CD images. You can now\r\n    mount CHD images with IMGMOUNT command, or from the\r\n    Drive menu. Based on libchdr library and the work\r\n    of the user whocares010. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated FLAC/MP3/WAV CD-DA decoder libraries to the\r\n    latest versions (versions 0.12.22, 0.6.19, 0.12.14\r\n    respectively). Thanks to mackron & kcgen. (Wengier)\r\n0.83.7\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.7.html\r\n  - The primary DOSBox-X Wiki is now located at the\r\n    URL: https://dosbox-x.com/wiki (Wengier)\r\n  - Implemented the x86 dynamic core for both 32-bit\r\n    and 64-bit systems by re-porting the code from SVN.\r\n    Dynamic core now supports either the dynamic_x86\r\n    or the dynamic_rec core. The dynamic_x86 core will\r\n    be used by default for x86 and x86_64 platforms and\r\n    if \"core=dynamic\" is set, and Windows 9x can be run\r\n    in this dynamic core (although at this time may\r\n    encounter some issue with the S3 driver). You can\r\n    also explicit specify setting \"core=dynamic_x86\" or\r\n    \"core=dynamic_rec\" for either the dynamic_x86 core\r\n    or the dynamic_rec core. Also thank joncampbell123\r\n    for the 64-bit fix. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now use your own save file (in addition to\r\n    save slots! There are now a \"Use save file\" toggle\r\n    item and \"Browse save file...\" for browsing save\r\n    files on your computer. A config option \"savefile\"\r\n    (in [dosbox] section) is added to specify a save\r\n    file to use at start. (Wengier)\r\n  - Save state feature now allows users to optionally\r\n    enter remarks when saving a state. A submenu group\r\n    \"Save/load option\" is added (under \"Capture\") where\r\n    you can toggle menu items \"No remark when saving\r\n    state\" (for disabling input of remarks when saving)\r\n    and \"force load state mode\". A menu item \"Display\r\n    state information\" is added as well to display the\r\n    information of the saved state. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now use native dialog box to display\r\n    quit warnings and save state errors. (Wengier)\r\n  - Changed some DOS error messages (such as \"Illegal\r\n    command\" which now reads \"Bad command or filename\")\r\n    similar to real DOS systems. (Wengier)\r\n  - ADDKEY and INT2FDBG commands now appear as programs\r\n    on Z: drive instead of shell commands. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved the -z (move virtual drive Z:) function of\r\n    MOUNT command. You can move the virtual drive as\r\n    many times as you want, and save/load states will\r\n    work even after you move the Z: drive. (Wengier)\r\n  - Enhanced the config option \"freesizecap\" to allow\r\n    the setting \"fixed\" which is the same as \"false\",\r\n    and a new setting \"relative\" is added, which will\r\n    be similar to the setting \"fixed\" but the reported\r\n    free disk size will also change relative to the\r\n    change of the free disk size ever since. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for Opus CD-DA tracks by porting and\r\n    cleaning up the source code from other projects.\r\n    Many thanks to Marty Shepard and kcgen. (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for FluidSynth MIDI Synthesizer is now\r\n    included in the MinGW builds by default just like\r\n    Visual Studio builds. Set \"mididevice=fluidsynth\"\r\n    and a soundfont file to use it. (Wengier)\r\n  - Enabled xBRZ scaler for Visual Studio SDL2 builds\r\n    just like Visual Studio SDL1 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu item \"Show Sound Blaster configuration\"\r\n    under \"Sound\" menu to show the current information\r\n    about Sound Blaster, and also menu item \"Show MIDI\r\n    device configuration\" (also under \"Sound\" menu)\r\n    to show information about the current MIDI device\r\n    such as the soundfont file in use. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Mount multiple disk/CD images\" option to the\r\n    mounting options of the Drive menu to allow users\r\n    to mount more than one disk/CD images to a drive,\r\n    swappable from the menu. Also added separators to\r\n    the Drive submenu to make it look better. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added new CPU types to the \"Emulate CPU speed\" menu\r\n    group namely 286-25MHz, 386DX-25MHz, 486DX4-100MHz,\r\n    486DX5-133MHz, Pentium-60MHz, Pentium-75MHz, and\r\n    Pentium-90MHz. Thanks again for the data provided\r\n    by the user maximus105. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now select a special key (e.g. Alt+Tab,\r\n    Ctrl+Break, Ctrl+Alt+Del, etc) to be sent from the\r\n    key defined in the mapper editor. The key can be\r\n    selected (Ctrl+Alt+Del by default) from the \"Send\r\n    special key\" menu group in \"Main\" menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added full Ctrl+Break emulation at the BIOS and\r\n    DOS level, updated console emulation to match.\r\n    The \"Pause\" mapper shortcut is now moved to\r\n    HOST[F11/F12]+Pause instead of Ctrl+Pause so that\r\n    Ctrl+Break can work properly for users, and the\r\n    function to send the Ctrl+Break key from the menu\r\n    (\"Send special key\" under \"Main\") is added. Also,\r\n    the PC-98 STOP key now functions the same as the\r\n    Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Break keys in IBM PC mode.\r\n  - Added functions \"CopyToClipboard\" and \"QuickRun\" to\r\n    the mapper editor so that you can use shortcuts to\r\n    activate them (default shortcuts: HOST(F11/F12)+A\r\n    and HOST(F11/F12)+Q respectively), and a default\r\n    shortcut HOST(F11/F12)+V is added to the clipboard\r\n    paste function. Meanwhile, FullCore and SimpleCore\r\n    shortcuts are removed from the mapper. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added two new menu items in the \"Shared clipboard\r\n    functions\" menu group under \"Main\", including \"Copy\r\n    all text on the DOS screen\" which will copy all\r\n    screen text to the clipboard, and \"Stop clipboard\r\n    pasting\" which allows user to stop pasting in the\r\n    middle of pasting long clipboard content. (Wengier)\r\n  - The mouse copy/paste feature is now available for\r\n    non-Windows systems on SDL2 builds. Also, pasting\r\n    from the clipboard with a mapped shortcut is also\r\n    available for Linux/X11 on SDL1 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Use US keyboard layout\" toggle menu item in\r\n    the \"PC-98\" menu group under \"Video\" to select\r\n    whether to force the default US keyboard layout in\r\n    PC-98 mode, same as the \"pc-98 force ibm keyboard\r\n    layout\" config option in [pc98] section. Also moved\r\n    the \"PC-98 PIT master clock\" options from the \"DOS\"\r\n    menu to this menu group. (Wengier)\r\n  - The full dosbox-x.reference.conf file is renamed to\r\n    dosbox-x.reference.full.conf. The original file\r\n    dosbox-x.reference.conf now contains common config\r\n    options instead of all config options. (Wengier)\r\n  - The CONFIG command and Configuration Tool will now\r\n    save common and modified config options by default.\r\n    The -all command-line option (or \"Save all options\r\n    to the configuration file\" checkbox) will force to\r\n    save all config options. A new -mod command-line\r\n    option is added to CONFIG command to save modified\r\n    config options only, and a new -norem command-line\r\n    option is added to not write remarks. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated the Windows installer to default to the\r\n    \"typical\" installation. For the full installation\r\n    start menu items will be added for DOSBox-X builds\r\n    copied to subdirectories. A new checkbox \"Write\r\n    common config options (instead of all) to the\r\n    configuration file\" is added which when checked\r\n    will only write common and modified advanced config\r\n    options to the config file. Furthermore, for both\r\n    \"typical\" and \"full\" installations the Windows\r\n    installer will now also copies the DLL files\r\n    inpout32.dll (32-bit) and inpoutx64.dll (64-bit) to\r\n    the DOSBox-X install directory for use with the\r\n    direct parallel port passthrough feature. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved Flatpak support for Linux. (rderooy)\r\n  - Improved message for the -help command-line option,\r\n    adding for example -silent and -socket command-line\r\n    options in the help messages. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added -silent command-line option to run DOSBox-X\r\n    silently (without showing the DOSBox-X window) and\r\n    then exit after executing AUTOEXEC.BAT. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed command-line option -socket not working for\r\n    the null-modem feature. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed issue that aspect ratio not being respected\r\n    in full-screen mode when a GLSL shader is enabled\r\n    with an OpenGL output. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed toggle in the \"Frameskip\" menu group did not\r\n    change when selecting a different option. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed shelling from programs may not work when the\r\n    shell config option is set. (Wengier)\r\n  - The default country setting (\"country\" option in\r\n    [config] section]) now defaults to auto-detection\r\n    if possible, or 81 (Japan) in PC-98 mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Increased the default maximum DOS files (adjustable\r\n    from [config] section) from 127 to 200. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved resetting with LOADLIN program. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved Gravis Ultrasound (GUS) implementation to\r\n    make it more accurately represent the GUS DMA state\r\n    as expected by the running DOS software.\r\n  - The archive attribute will no longer automatically\r\n    be applied to directories on non-Windows systems.\r\n    This fixed issue with PLAYMIDI.EXE from Gravis\r\n    Ultrasound when listing directories. (Wengier)\r\n  - Applied hack to allow the low DMA channel detection\r\n    in the SB16 DIAGNOSE program to work. (Wengier)\r\n  - The default setting of the clip_paste_speed option\r\n    has been changed from 20 to 30, which will help\r\n    prevent lost keystrokes when pasting from the host\r\n    clipboard for some programs. (Wengier)\r\n  - With Pentium CPU setting (cputype=pentium) DOSBox-X\r\n    no longer reports FDIV bug by default. An advanced\r\n    config option \"report fdiv bug\" is added to report\r\n    such CPU bug when set to true. (rderooy & Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for the XDG_DATA_HOME environment\r\n    variable for config directory in Linux. (rderooy)\r\n  - Added support for compiling with pcap for Windows\r\n    MinGW builds. (Jookia)\r\n  - Added config option \"windowposition\" (in [sdl]\r\n    section) to set the window position at startup in\r\n    the positionX,positionY format. (tomba4)\r\n  - Added config option \"raw_mouse_input\" (in [sdl]\r\n    section; SDL2 builds only) to bypass the operating\r\n    system's mouse acceleration & sensitivity settings.\r\n    Implemented by NicknineTheEagle.\r\n  - Added config option \"startquiet\" (in [dos] section)\r\n    which when set to true will silence the information\r\n    messages before launching Windows programs to run\r\n    on the Windows host. A toggle menu item \"Quiet mode\r\n    (no start messages)\" is added to the \"Windows host\r\n    applications\" menu group in \"DOS\" menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - The menu \"Show details\" (under \"Main\") is renamed\r\n    to \"Show FPS and RT speed in title bar\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Add menu group \"Text-mode\" under \"Video\" menu to\r\n    change some text-mode related video settings, such\r\n    as changing the number of rows and columns. A zip\r\n    package named TEXTUTIL.ZIP is added to the Z drive\r\n    that contains various utilities (such as CGA.COM,\r\n    EGA.COM, 132X25.COM, 132X43.COM) to change current\r\n    video setting from the command line. Also added a\r\n    config option \"high intensity blinking\" which when\r\n    set will display high intensity background colors\r\n    instead of blinking foreground text. The menu item\r\n    \"Allow 9-pixel wide fonts\" is moved from the menu\r\n    group \"Compatibility\" to here. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Debugging\" menu group under \"Help\" menu, and\r\n    moved items from the \"Video\" Debug and \"DOS\" Debug\r\n    menus and the debugger here (debug builds only).\r\n    Also allowed to hide/show the console or debugger\r\n    window in Windows debug builds. With the menu item\r\n    \"Console wait on error\" checked the Windows console\r\n    window will wait for the ENTER key before closing\r\n    itself after an E_EXIT occurs. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated MPXPLAY to latest version 1.65. (Wengier)\r\n  - Integrated SVN commits (Allofich)\r\n    - r4386: Correct MPU-401 clock-to-host function to\r\n    operate independently of playing. Fixes hang at\r\n    exit when playing Roland music in demos by The\r\n    Phoney Coders. Clamp tempo to valid range.\r\n    - r4384: ICW1 on the PIC clears the Interrupt Mask\r\n    Register. Fixes Antagony and quite a few demos that\r\n    expect IRQs to be unmasked.\r\n    - r4382: Refine adlib timers a bit more and make\r\n    reading the Adlib take a bit more time.\r\n    - r4378: Prevent some possible deadlocks with sti\r\n    in dynrec core.\r\n    - r4375: Improve compatibility with older Intel\r\n    chipsets\r\n    - r4374: Add a bit of hack so cycles=max/auto 90%\r\n    keeps on working inside batch files after r3925.\r\n    - r4371: Fix regression in Clue: Master Detective.\r\n    - r4370: As an adjunct to r4369, make the reference\r\n      counts of standard device handles equivalent to\r\n      those of real DOS.\r\n    - r4369: Compatible side-effect behavior of DOS in\r\n      the file close function.\r\n    - r4368: Improve error codes for some DOS file functions.\r\n    - r4367: Change FPU_FBST to only write 18 decimals\r\n      instead of the wrongly 19, this makes it possible\r\n      to switch 64 integers which in turn fixes some\r\n      rounding issues. (jmarsh)\r\n    - r4282,r4283: Switch to a different way to calculate\r\n      DBOPL table offsets.\r\n    - r4280: Prevent GenerateDMASound from running with\r\n      input of 0.\r\n    - r4279: Remove DMA_TRANSFEREND and replace with\r\n      DMA_MASKED.\r\n    - r4277: Remove cases not needed after r4276\r\n    - r4276: Remove defunct code related to the initial\r\n      display mode of the system BIOS during video mode\r\n      changes.\r\n    - r4274: fix externals.\r\n    - r4273: Make frameskip an integer.\r\n    - r4269: Use fabsf when return value is a float.\r\n      Small warning fix.\r\n    - r4265: Some more cleanups and memleak fixes.\r\n    - r4264: Pick some lowhanging fruit. (some memory\r\n      leaks and unused variables)\r\n    - r4262: missed one\r\n    - r4261: These actually use float as input.\r\n    - r4258: Rename bios tester to biostest and make it\r\n      debug only to avoid people trying to load real\r\n      bioses.\r\n    - r4257: Add simple program that allows you to boot\r\n      into a bios image for running cpu tester bios.\r\n0.83.6\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.6.html\r\n  - Improved internal Voodoo card hardware emulation,\r\n    such as fixing the font issue with the 3dfx version\r\n    of Tomb Raider when using non-Glide mode. Portions\r\n    of the code are ported from DOSBox ECE. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added OpenGL shader support by porting the feature\r\n    from DOSBox SVN. GLSL shaders are now supported in\r\n    both SDL1 and SDL2 builds, and this also allows\r\n    pixel-perfect scaling to be enabled for the OpenGL\r\n    outputs. The config option \"glshader\" (in [render]\r\n    section) can be used to specify a GLSL shader file\r\n    or a built-in shader when the output is set to\r\n    \"opengl\" or \"openglnb\". For example, you can use\r\n    the setting \"glshader=sharp\" (built-in shader) or\r\n    \"glshader=pixel_perfect\" (with GLSL shader file)\r\n    for the pixel-perfect scaling mode. The Windows\r\n    installer will also copy several GLSL shader files\r\n    to the \"glshaders\" subdirectory of the DOSBox-X\r\n    install directory to be used directly. (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for FluidSynth MIDI Synthesizer is now\r\n    included in the Windows Visual Studio builds by\r\n    default. Set \"mididevice=fluidsynth\" and a sound\r\n    font (e.g. GeneralUser_GS.sf2) to use it. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated the MUNT MT32 emulation library to its\r\n    latest version 2.4.0. A few new MT32 config options\r\n    (starting with \"mt32.\") are added to [midi] section\r\n    of the DOSBox-X configuration. (Wengier)\r\n  - The DOSMID and MPXPLAY programs have been built\r\n    into DOSBox-X, both can be found on the Z drive and\r\n    feature full-screen user interfaces with support\r\n    for command-line usages (use /? option for help).\r\n    DOSMID can play MIDI/RMI/MUS audio files, whereas\r\n    MPXPLAY is a powerful and flexible audio player\r\n    with support for a variety of formats including\r\n    AAC/AC3/APE/FLAC/MP2/MP3/MPC/OGG/WAV and more with\r\n    playlist support. (Wengier)\r\n  - The mounting options \"Mount as Hard Disk\", \"Mount\r\n    as CD-ROM\", \"Mount as Floppy\", \"Mount disk image\"\r\n    and \"Boot from disk image\" (previously only for\r\n    Windows) in the \"Drive\" menu and the \"Quick launch\r\n    program...\" in the \"DOS\" menu are now available\r\n    for non-Windows platforms as well. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Shared Windows clipboard functions\" menu\r\n    group under \"Main\", which allows you to enable\r\n    or disable the different ways for DOSBox-X to\r\n    communicate with the Windows clipboard. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"dos clipboard api\" in [dos]\r\n    section to control whether to enable the DOS APIs\r\n    for communications with the Windows clipboard for\r\n    DOS applications. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"clip_mouse_button\" to select\r\n    a mouse button (middle, right, or none; with right\r\n    mouse button being the default) for copying to and\r\n    pasting from the Windows clipboard. (Wengier)\r\n  - The mouse wheel movements will be automatically\r\n    converted into up/down arrows by default for the\r\n    integrated DOS now. You can also enable it for\r\n    the guest system from the \"Main\" menu (\"mouse wheel\r\n    movements\" -> \"Enable for guest systems also\") or\r\n    from the config file. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Emulate CPU speed\" menu group (under \"CPU\")\r\n    to emulate the speed of a specific CPU class. The\r\n    cycles to emulate are approximations of the actual\r\n    CPU hardware, and they are available thanks to data\r\n    provided by the user maximus105. Also added config\r\n    option \"cycle emulation percentage adjust\" in [cpu]\r\n    section for users who would like to make relative\r\n    percentage adjustments (between -25% and 25%) in\r\n    case it is necessary. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added SORT command from FreeDOS. It can be used to\r\n    sort input, e.g. \"TYPE FILE.TXT | SORT\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Added DELTREE command to delete a directory and all\r\n    the subdirectories and files in it as in a real DOS\r\n    system. Please use it with caution. (Wengier)\r\n  - The command for starting the Configuration Tool has\r\n    been renamed from \"SHOWGUI\" to \"CFGTOOL\". A new\r\n    command-line option -gui is added to CONFIG command\r\n    to start the Configuration Tool as well. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X now includes ZIP.EXE and UNZIP.EXE from\r\n    InfoZip for zipping and unzipping files in DOS.\r\n    Both programs will appear on the Z drive. (Wengier)\r\n  - The powerful DOS CD player called SJGPLAY has been\r\n    built into DOSBox-X. You can now find the program\r\n    CDPLAY.EXE in the Z drive for playing Audio CDs in\r\n    DOS, which supports both graphical and command-line\r\n    usage, and you will also find a text file named\r\n    CDPLAY.TXT in the Z drive for a quick usage guide.\r\n    A zip package including full documentation and some\r\n    extras will additionally appear as SJGPLAY.ZIP in\r\n    the Z drive. This freeware program was written by\r\n    Steve Gray and is now included in DOSBox-X with\r\n    explicit permission of the author. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now by default show a quit warning\r\n    if a DOS program or game, or a guest system is\r\n    running. The previous behavior can be set with\r\n    \"quit warning=autofile\". (Wengier)\r\n  - The welcome banner when DOSBox-X starts has been\r\n    improved for a better looking and should provide\r\n    more helpful instructions for users. (Wengier)\r\n  - Add new \"Help\" menu which includes menu items\r\n    \"Introduction\", \"DOSBox-X homepage\", \"DOSBox-X Wiki\r\n    guide\", \"DOSBox-X support\" and \"About\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved the message when automatically re-running\r\n    the executable which failed with the \"Packed file\r\n    is corrupt\" error. Also added the \"autoloadfix\"\r\n    config option which when set to \"false\" will not\r\n    automatically re-run such programs. (Wengier)\r\n  - The display for several section names in DOSBox-X's\r\n    graphical configuration tool has been capitalized\r\n    or modified otherwise to look better. A default\r\n    shortcut key HOST(F11/F12)+C is added for starting\r\n    the graphical configuration tool. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added the \"Show advanced options\" checkbox in the\r\n    main screen of the Configuration GUI to toggle\r\n    whether to display all config options for the\r\n    sections. If unchecked (default), it will show\r\n    common config options instead of all of them. A\r\n    new config option \"show advanced options\" is added\r\n    which when set to \"true\" will make the checkbox\r\n    checked by default. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added code to cap the scan line length given to\r\n    the VESA BIOS given the video mode. This prevents\r\n    VBETEST.EXE from doing test patterns smaller than\r\n    the actual display, which can happen with 32bpp\r\n    320x200 modes and 1MB or less video RAM.\r\n  - VESA BIOS Set Scan Line Length fixed to properly\r\n    report and handle scan line length for 16-color\r\n    SVGA planar modes. VBETEST 16-color modes now\r\n    display correctly.\r\n  - Added option to control whether VESA BIOS panning\r\n    (the original VBE call) waits for vsync.\r\n  - Moved video related config options from [dosbox]\r\n    section to its own [video] section. These options\r\n    in existing config files will be automatically\r\n    redirected to the [video] section from the [dosbox]\r\n    section when DOSBox-X starts. Windows installer can\r\n    also move such config options from existing config\r\n    files automatically. (Wengier)\r\n  - Cleared modem phone book before parsing it. Thank\r\n    NicknineTheEagle for the improvement.\r\n  - Improved the help message of MOUNT command. Also\r\n    added option -examples to show its usage examples,\r\n    similar to IMGMOUNT and IMGMAKE commands. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed freeze when trying to reboot the internal\r\n    DOS when using a different code page and it is in\r\n    CGA or EGA emulation modes. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now try to use the internal DOS date\r\n    and time (instead of always using the host date and\r\n    date) for file modification timestamps. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu item \"Expanded memory (EMS)\" under \"DOS\"\r\n    menu to dynamically enable or disable EMS memory\r\n    at run-time. You can now also modify EMS memory\r\n    with CONFIG command from command-line. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"drive z hide files\" (in [dos]\r\n    section) to hide or remove files listed (separated\r\n    by spaces) from the Z drive. If a file has a \"/\"\r\n    prefix (e.g. \"/INTRO.COM\"), then the specified file\r\n    will have the hidden attribute (\"DIR /A\" will list\r\n    all such files) instead of completely disappearing\r\n    from the Z drive. (Wengier)\r\n  - You can now add your own programs or files to the\r\n    Z drive! Put your programs or files in the drivez\r\n    directory located in the DOSBox-X program folder\r\n    or the DOSBox-X configuration directory, and they\r\n    will automatically appear on the Z drive. If any of\r\n    the files have the same names as the built-in ones,\r\n    they will replace the built-in files. For example,\r\n    you can replace the built-in EDIT.COM and XCOPY.EXE\r\n    programs (from FreeDOS) with MS-DOS counterparts.\r\n    Windows installer will now automatically create a\r\n    drivez directory with a README.TXT file in it too.\r\n    For subdirectories support please use MOUNT command\r\n    to mount local directory instead. (Wengier).\r\n0.83.5\r\n  - Release notes for this version:\r\n    https://dosbox-x.com/release-0.83.5.html\r\n  - Windows installer now offers the option to upgrade\r\n    the DOSBox-X config file (dosbox-x.conf) to the\r\n    latest version format automatically while keeping\r\n    users' current settings. It can also add a context\r\n    menu for executables (.exe, .com, .bat), config\r\n    files (.conf) and folders in the Windows Explorer\r\n    so that you could quickly run or open them with\r\n    DOSBox-X from the Windows Explorer. More icons\r\n    are added to the DOSBox-X program group within the\r\n    Start menu as well. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"startbanner\" in [dosbox]\r\n    section which if set to \"false\" would skip the\r\n    welcome banner when DOSBox-X starts. Also added\r\n    config option \"fastbioslogo\" which if set to \"true\"\r\n    will skip the BIOS logo (replacing the command-line\r\n    option -fastbootlogo). A new command-line option\r\n    \"-fastlaunch\" is added to enable fast launch mode\r\n    by skipping both the logo and the banner. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"ega per scanline hpel\" in\r\n    [dosbox] section to control whether EGA emulation\r\n    latches hpel at display start (as VGA emulation\r\n    does) or allows hpel to change per scanline.\r\n    Setting the option to false is needed for some\r\n    games like Commander Keen.\r\n  - Support for mounting CD images with a sector size\r\n    of 2448, used by for example the MDF image of the\r\n    game Grand Theft Auto. (Wengier)\r\n  - Allowed Sound Blaster to be enabled by the games\r\n    \"Desert Strike\" and \"Jungle Strike\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Sound Blaster Pro emulation now maps DSP commands\r\n    0x41 to 0x47 as aliases of 0x40 (set time constant)\r\n    to support broken demoscene code that uses 0x41\r\n    in that way. Yes, such code would obviously break\r\n    on clone cards and the SB16. Added a config option\r\n    \"dsp command aliases\" in [sblaster] section to turn\r\n    it off for debugging. Alias is documented on Vogons\r\n    forums where someone made a SB Pro clone card.\r\n  - Fixed the issue with CD audio play by porting the\r\n    audio code from DOSBox ECE. (Wengier)\r\n  - COPY command now assumes /Y automatically when\r\n    running in the batch file or with CALL command\r\n    (or COMMAND /C) as in real DOS. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will allow control characters 8 (BS),\r\n    9 (TAB), 26 (SUB), and 27 (ESC) when executing GOTO\r\n    command in batch files without warnings. (Wengier)\r\n  - Normal core: REP MOVSD now checks segment limits\r\n    for ES:(E)DI and throws a GP fault if exceeded.\r\n    Demoscene productions marked as using VESA BIOS\r\n    modes and scribbling on the VGA BIOS are relying\r\n    on segment limits and GP faults to fake a linear\r\n    framebuffer.\r\n  - Added config option \"vesa bank switching window\r\n    range check\" to allow disabling the VESA BIOS\r\n    window number range check when called on to\r\n    bank switch. Needed for \"Pill\" by Opiate in the\r\n    end credits, which for some reason requires a\r\n    call for window number 0xFFFF to succeed in order\r\n    to draw credits without glitching.\r\n  - Added config option \"vesa bank switching window\r\n    mirroring\" for instructing VESA BIOS to ignore\r\n    bank switching window parameter when asked to\r\n    get/set bank switching window setting. Needed for\r\n    some old demoscene and game applications that\r\n    assume Window B is available, and will not render\r\n    SVGA properly without it.\r\n  - Added config option \"quit warning\" to indicate if\r\n    DOSBox-X should warn show a warning message when\r\n    you try to close the DOSBox-X window. If set to\r\n    \"auto\" (default), DOSBox-X will warn only if at\r\n    least one file handle is still open, or you are\r\n    currently running a guest system. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added command-line option \"-defaultconf\" to use the\r\n    default config settings. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added command-line option \"-defaultdir\" to specify\r\n    a directory (instead of the current directory) as\r\n    the working directory. DOSBox-X will look for the\r\n    dosbox-x.conf file in this directory. (Wengier)\r\n  - The -winrun command-line option will also enable\r\n    LFN support with \"lfn=auto\" on Windows. (Wengier)\r\n  - VER /R now shows DOSBox-X's Git commit SHA1, in\r\n    addition to the build date and other version\r\n    information shown by the VER command. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed that joystick may not work with the setting\r\n    \"usescancodes=auto\" when a non-US keyboard layout\r\n    is activated on the SDL1 build. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will now search for system fonts if the\r\n    fonts required for the printing feature cannot be\r\n    found in the FONTS directory. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added menu item \"Send form-feed\" under the DOS menu\r\n    for manually ejecting new pages to print. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Quick launch program...\" menu (under \"DOS\")\r\n    to quickly run the specified program as selected\r\n    by the Windows file browser in DOSBox-X. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Drive information\" menu item under \"Drive\"\r\n    menu to show information for the specified drive,\r\n    and added \"Show mounted drive numbers\" menu item\r\n    under \"DOS\" menu to show details for all mounted\r\n    drive numbers (0-5). (Wengier)\r\n  - The command \"Swap CD\" now swaps only CD drives (as\r\n    the name), not all non-floppy drives. Also added\r\n    \"Swap disk\" menu item under the \"Drive\" menu for\r\n    swapping individual mounted drives. (Wengier)\r\n  - IMGMAKE now tries to resolve home directory (~)\r\n    on Linux and macOS platforms. Also improved the\r\n    help message for this command. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed unmounting swap disks when unmounting drives\r\n    with MOUNT or IMGMOUNT command. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed possible failure when mounting .VHD images,\r\n    and the issue that leading colon (:) or read-only\r\n    marker may not work for such images. (Wengier)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT command without parameters now shows the\r\n    disk position and number of swap disks, as well as\r\n    IDE controller (if applicable). Also added option\r\n    -examples to show its usage examples. (Wengier)\r\n  - Add \"-ro\" option for IMGMOUNT command to mark all\r\n    disk images as read-only at once. You could also\r\n    mark read-only disk images individually using the\r\n    leading colon as in previous versions. (Wengier)\r\n  - The default value for \"output\" (in \"sdl\" section)\r\n    is now \"default\", which will default to the value\r\n    according to your platform. (Wengier)\r\n  - The -Q (quiet) option of MOUNT, BOOT and RESCAN\r\n    commands now silences virtually all outputs (error\r\n    and normal messages) of these commands. (Wengier)\r\n  - Worked around the mounting issue with LaunchBox,\r\n    by allowing a mounting command-line with single\r\n    quotes like MOUNT C 'X:\\DOS' on Windows. (Wengier)\r\n  - Unmounting ISO drives will auto-unmount associated\r\n    El Torito floppy drives (if any) too. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated xxHash library by Yann Collet from 0.7.4\r\n    to the stable version 0.8.0. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for the OPL2 audio board by setting\r\n    the config option \"oplemu=opl2board\".\r\n  - The save state feature now tries to save and then\r\n    restore the mounted drives of all types (if the\r\n    paths or image files still exist on host system).\r\n    This fixes the \"save state corrupted\" error while\r\n    trying to load saved states but the drives are not\r\n    yet mounted in DOSBox-X. (Wengier)\r\n  - The save state feature now verifies the emulated\r\n    machine type (VGA, PC98, etc) too when loading a\r\n    saved state. All confirm and error dialog boxes\r\n    for saving or loading states appear in a cross-\r\n    platform manner now, instead of only on Windows\r\n    systems. Also added the option to remove the saved\r\n    state in the selected save slot. (Wengier)\r\n  - Increased the number of save slots from 10 to 100.\r\n    Each page in the save slot menu (under \"Capture\")\r\n    still shows 10 slots as before, but you can now go\r\n    to the previous or next page (up to 10 pages) for\r\n    more save slots (100 in total). (Wengier).\r\n  - The [pci] section is now the [voodoo] section, and\r\n    the config option \"voodoo\" (the only option of that\r\n    section) is now named \"voodoo_card\" within the\r\n    [voodoo] section to make clear it is for emulating\r\n    the Voodoo card hardware. Also added config option\r\n    \"voodoo_maxmem\" (default: true) to specify whether\r\n    to use the maximum memory size (12MB instead of the\r\n    standard 4MB) for the Vooodoo card. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for Glide wrapper. It can be enabled\r\n    with the new config option \"glide\" set to \"true\"\r\n    in [voodoo] section. The library file glide2x.dll\r\n    (Windows)/libglide2x.so (Linux)/libglide2x.dylib\r\n    (macOS) is required for Glide to work. Be sure to\r\n    use 32-bit dll for 32-bit DOSBox-X binary, and\r\n    64-bit dll for 64-bit DOSBox-X binary. (Wengier)\r\n0.83.4\r\n  - Fixed loading saved states in fullscreen mode with\r\n    the \"aspect=true\" setting. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"saveslot\" to select default\r\n    save slot (1-10). The timestamps for the saved\r\n    states will also be shown in the menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added key mapper for sending the Ctrl+Alt+Del key,\r\n    with HOST(F11/F12)+Del by default. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added dosbox-x.conf setting to ignore the EGA/VGA\r\n    \"extended memory\" bit. It was originally defined\r\n    back when stock EGA/VGA cards could ship with 64KB\r\n    of memory. The option is needed for DOS games that\r\n    accidentally clear the bit when using unchained\r\n    256-color modes (Mr. Blobby).\r\n  - Added new default value \"auto\" for the setting\r\n    \"usescancodesauto\" (in [sdl] section of the config\r\n    file) to work around issues with non-US keyboard\r\n    layouts on SDL1 builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added code pages 808, 850, 852, 853, 855, 857,\r\n    858, 869, 872 for host to guest codepage mapping\r\n    on mounted local or overlay drives. (Wengier)\r\n  - The mapper options \"Increase recording volume\" and\r\n    \"Decrease recording volume\" as well as function\r\n    \"Show sound levels\" (from MIXER command) appear\r\n    now as menu items (under \"Sound\") too. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed inputting of ASCII character 224 and 240\r\n    in Windows SDL2 or MinGW builds. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed possible DPMI error when running Windows\r\n    98 installation from the DOSBox-X shell without\r\n    using a batch file. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed a bug in the FAT driver that can cause\r\n    a byte to get lost if writing up to the end of\r\n    a cluster, which seems to be behind the\r\n    corruption with program group files when running\r\n    Windows for Workgroups 3.11 from DOSBox-X shell.\r\n    [https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues/1758#issuecomment-665193066]\r\n  - Unknown INT 2Fh calls are now debug output, not\r\n    an error.\r\n  - Added VESA BIOS mode 68h alias as indicated on\r\n    the Vogons forum.\r\n  - Fixed handling of config commands with spaces\r\n    when the \"shell configuration as commands\"\r\n    setting is enabled (quotes are needed in such\r\n    cases). Also added \"Config options as commands\"\r\n    toggle menu (under \"DOS\") to enable/disable the\r\n    feature from menu. It is disabled by default to\r\n    avoid name clash with other programs. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Enable quick reboot\" toggle menu (under\r\n    \"DOS\") so that when enabled, DOS restart calls\r\n    will reboot the emulated DOS (integrated or\r\n    guest DOS) instead of the virtual machine in\r\n    DOSBox-X. Also, you could change the default\r\n    setting for this by setting the new \"quick\r\n    reboot\" config option in \"dos\" section (Wengier)\r\n  - Added new \"Reboot guest system\" menu item (under\r\n    \"Main\") to reboot the kernel of the integrated\r\n    DOS or the guest DOS directly. The previous menu\r\n    item \"Reset guest system\" has been renamed to\r\n    \"Reset virtual machine\" which will restart the\r\n    virtual machine in DOSBox-X instead. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Reported DOS version\" sub-menu (under\r\n    \"DOS\") to dynamically change the reported DOS\r\n    version (3.3, 5.0, 6.22, 7.1, or custom). This\r\n    may enable/disable long filename (LFN) support\r\n    with the default \"lfn=auto\" setting. (Wengier)\r\n  - LS is now an external command appearing on drive\r\n    Z: as LS.COM instead of a builtin shell command.\r\n    This avoids name clash with game \"Links LS 97\"\r\n    which has the main executable named LS.EXE. Also\r\n    fixed minor issues in this command. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed the game \"Disney's Duck Tales: the Quest\r\n    for Gold\" not able to start. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved Configuration GUI's handling of \"4dos\"\r\n    and \"config\" sections. Also added the \"Save...\"\r\n    button just before the \"Close\" button. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"euro\" config option (in [render] section)\r\n    to display Euro symbol instead of the specified\r\n    ASCII character in any code page. (Wengier)\r\n  - PC-98 CG MMIO writes fixed to limit writes only\r\n    to the user-defined areas, same as the IO writes.\r\n    This fixes \"Niko Niko\" that appears to write a\r\n    few too many 0xE1 bytes when filling text\r\n    attribute RAM and into the CG MMIO region.\r\n  - With -winrun command-line option or the setting\r\n    \"startcmd=true\" (Windows only), you can now\r\n    directly launch Windows programs on mounted local\r\n    or overlay drives to run on the host. The option\r\n    \"startwait=false\" can be used to disable waiting\r\n    for Windows programs after started. This can also\r\n    be toggled from the \"DOS\" menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added START command to run commands on Windows\r\n    host system. The /MAX, /MIN, /HID options can\r\n    be used to run the specified program maximized,\r\n    minimized, or hidden (they can be shortened to\r\n    +, -, _ respectively). This command is disabled\r\n    by default, but can be enabled by either the\r\n    \"startcmd\" config option (in [dos] section) or\r\n    the -winrun command-line option (which will also\r\n    enable the CLIP$ device for Windows clipboard\r\n    support). START will run commands listed in the\r\n    \"startincon\" config option (separated by space)\r\n    in the Windows Command Prompt and wait for a key\r\n    press before exiting. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added SHELL= option to the [config] section in\r\n    dosbox-x.conf to specify an alternative shell,\r\n    e.g. \"SHELL=4DOS.COM\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Added built-in 4DOS 8.00 shell for 4DOS features\r\n    and capabilities. There is now a [4dos] section\r\n    in the dosbox-x.conf file to act as the 4DOS.INI\r\n    config file if you use this shell. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Mouse wheel movements\" menu (under \"Main\")\r\n    to enable or disable the mouse wheel movements\r\n    to arrow (up/down etc) feature. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"Quick right mouse button copy/paste\" menu\r\n    item toggle to allow quick Windows clipboard copy\r\n    and paste via the right mouse button without any\r\n    key modifier that may have been specified by the\r\n    config option \"clip_key_modifier\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed mounting a directory with command-line like\r\n    \"dosbox-x .\", and fixed mounting disk images with\r\n    spaces via the \"Drive\" menu on Windows. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added \"mountwarning\" config setting so you could\r\n    optionally disable the warning when attempting to\r\n    mount C:\\ in Windows or / otherwise. (Wengier)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT now assumes \"-fs none\" automatically if\r\n    a drive number is specified instead of a drive\r\n    letter. Moreover, it will assume the image file\r\n    name \"IMGMAKE.IMG\" if no filename is specified by\r\n    the user. Also improved the command's handling of\r\n    El Torito floppy drives, e.g. you can use option\r\n    \"-bootcd d\" instead of \"-el-torito d\". (Wengier)\r\n  - IMGMAKE warning replaced to indicate a general\r\n    incompatibility between MS-DOS/SCANDISK and\r\n    cluster sizes 64KB or larger.\r\n  - IMGMAKE command will now use the image file name\r\n    \"IMGMAKE.IMG\" if no file name is specified (either\r\n    in the mounted local directory or in the DOSBox-X\r\n    program directory if the current directory is not\r\n    a local directory). The command now also supports\r\n    a -force option to force overwrite the image file\r\n    if it already exists. Furthermore, IMGMAKE will\r\n    delete the generated image file if an error occurs\r\n    during the image file creation. (Wengier)\r\n    \r\n0.83.3\r\n  - IMGMAKE can now generate FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32\r\n    filesystems. New option \"-fat\" is added to select\r\n    the filesystem for the disk image.\r\n  - Fixed command-line like \"./dosbox-x /dir/app.bat\"\r\n    not able to launch the specified program (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed bug in DIR command's /P option which might\r\n    cause it to not work properly. (Wengier)\r\n  - The default key modifier for the Windows clipboard\r\n    copy & paste via the right mouse button feature is\r\n    now \"shift\" instead of \"disabled\". (Wengier)\r\n  - Single-stepping in the debugger with the 286 and\r\n    8086 normal cores now works correctly when stepping\r\n    over instructions with a segment prefix.\r\n  - Pentium MMX instructions now only available for\r\n    Pentium MMX or higher. Fixed the bug that allowed\r\n    MMX instructions for Pentium and lower if programs\r\n    ignored the CPUID feature bits. Also fixed Pentium\r\n    MMX instructions so that they work in both 16-bit\r\n    real mode and 32-bit protected mode to match how\r\n    they work in real hardware (joncampbell123)\r\n  - Updated DOSBox-X's implementation for Pentium MMX\r\n    instructions to latest version by kekko (Wengier)\r\n  - DOSBox-X will try to automatically run the program\r\n    with LOADFIX if the error message \"Packed file is\r\n    corrupt\" is detected. (Wengier)\r\n  - MOUNT command can now mount a drive to the UNC\r\n    root path in the form \\\\ComputerName\\SharedFolder\r\n    on Windows systems. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved the HX-DOS build package to make it fully\r\n    automated: all required HX DOS Extender files will\r\n    be included in the package, and dosbox-x.exe can\r\n    now be run directly in a real DOS system without\r\n    external requirements. (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed incorrect frame rate reported by 3Dfx Voodoo\r\n    emulation (rderooy, backported from DOSBox SVN).\r\n  - Added the \"Boot from disk image\" menu item (A:, C:,\r\n    and D: drives only) in the \"Drive\" menu to boot the\r\n    specified disk image directly in Windows. (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for converting mouse wheel movements into\r\n    keyboard presses like arrow keys, configurable by\r\n    the option \"mouse_wheel_key\" (default is 0 which\r\n    disables this feature). When set to 1, mouse wheel\r\n    movements are converted to up/down arrows. Setting\r\n    it to 2 or 3 converts such movements to left/right\r\n    arrows or PageUp/PageDn keys respectively. (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for reloading the keyboard mapper file with\r\n    the config -set command. (Wengier)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT command without parameters will show disk\r\n    names for drive-number only mounts. (Wengier)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT can now autodetect DOS <= 3.21 harddisk\r\n    geometry with MFM sector images (rderooy & Wengier)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT -fs none fixed to use same geometry detect\r\n    function that FAT filesystem mounting uses.\r\n  - Added suppprt for mounting overlay drives using MOUNT\r\n    command with \"-t overlay\" option. Backported from\r\n    DOSBox SVN and adopted for DOSBox-X with additional\r\n    features such as long filename and PC-98 support, it\r\n    allows the users to redirect new and changed file(s)\r\n    to a different location transparently. (Wengier)\r\n  - Cleaned up the DPI awareness auto-detection code to\r\n    allow Visual Studio builds to again run on Windows 7.\r\n    Meanwhile, MinGW builds (either SDL1 or SDL2 version)\r\n    are still required for Windows XP systems. (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated Nuked OPL3 to latest version 1.8 for accurate\r\n    OPL3 emulation (Wengier)\r\n  - Added AUTOTYPE command to perform scripted keyboard\r\n    entry into a running DOS program or game. Ported from\r\n    DOSBox-staging, it can be used to reliably skip intro,\r\n    provide input to answer initial startup or config\r\n    questions, or conduct a simple demo. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added code page 866 (Cyrillic Russian) to support\r\n    host to guest code page mapping (tuffnatty)\r\n  - Mouse buttons (left, middle, right) can now be mapped\r\n    to keys in the keyboard mapper. (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for mounting .cue files with MP3/OGG/WAV/FLAC\r\n    compressed audio tracks. (Wengier) \r\n  - Rewrote the Windows installer for DOSBox-X, as well as\r\n    the building script for the installer. All required\r\n    build tools including the Inno Setup Compiler are now\r\n    provided in the repository and will be automatically\r\n    called by the building script. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"mapperfile_sdl2\" for SDL2 builds.\r\n    SDL1 and SDL2 builds of DOSBox-X can not use the same\r\n    mapper file, or they will likely malfunction. Adding\r\n    this option allows SDL1 and SDL2 builds of DOSBox-X\r\n    to work with the same dosbox-x.conf file. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added GUI menu option under \"DOS\" to change the long\r\n    filename setting (enable, disable, or auto). (Wengier)\r\n  - Improvements and fixes to the save/load state feature:\r\n    It now supports Sound Blaster Goldplay mode;\r\n    It now saves PC-98 FM interrupt state so that reloading\r\n    state does not cause hung music;\r\n    It is also fixed not to crash when used within a guest\r\n    operating system (when the DOS kernel has been shut down\r\n    using the BOOT command);\r\n    It now supports memory size up to 1GB;\r\n    It will save and verify the DOSBox-X version and build.\r\n    States saved by DOSBox-X in one platform (e.g. 64-bit\r\n    Windows) may not work in another (e.g. 32-bit Linux).\r\n    The GUI menu will show if the save slot is empty, and if\r\n    not the program name of save state will be displayed.\r\n  - Re-ported and improved the save state feature for saving\r\n    and loading states with support for up to 10 save slots.\r\n    They can be selected from the \"Capture\" menu. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added COUNTRY command to set country code for country-\r\n    specific date and time formats. For example, the command\r\n    \"COUNTRY 61\" sets the country code to 61 (International\r\n    English) which uses the DD-MM-YYYY date format instead\r\n    of the default (U.S.) MM-DD-YYYY date format. (Wengier)\r\n  - DOS 440Dh IOCTL function 67h (get access flag) added to\r\n    allow FDISK.EXE to determine FAT filesystem type. Also\r\n    implemented function 40h (set device parameters) and\r\n    function 46h (set volume serial number). (Wengier)\r\n  - Unknown DOS 440Dh IOCTLs warnings now indicate whether\r\n    triggered by call or query.\r\n  - S3 VESA BIOS mode number for 1024x768 32bpp changed to\r\n    avoid conflict with Windows 95 S3 driver and 800x600\r\n    16bpp mode.\r\n  - FAT driver no longer mounts FAT32 volumes unless the\r\n    DOS version is 7.1 or higher, and it no longer mounts\r\n    FAT16B LBA volumes unless the DOS version is 7.0 or\r\n    higher. These are to mimic the MS-DOS behavior.\r\n  - Fixed FAT driver not to attempt to mount partitions that\r\n    have nothing to do with the FAT filesystem (such as\r\n    type 0Dh and extended LBA partition tables). Also fixed\r\n    the FAT driver to not assume partition start sector 63\r\n    if it cannot identify a partition to use.\r\n  - Added code to FAT driver to identify telltale pattern\r\n    left by Microsoft FDISK when a partition is created (but\r\n    not yet formatted) and reject.\r\n0.83.2\r\n  - Added help messages for some supported commands. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added phone book support for the emulated modem. There is\r\n    a new phonebookfile= option in the [serial] section. The\r\n    phone book file entries need to be in the format of:\r\n    \"<dummy number> <hostname/ip:port>\" e.g.\r\n    5551234 cavebbs.homeip.net:23\r\n    Thank NicknineTheEagle for implementing this feature.\r\n  - Implemented the missing EMS subfunctions 52h and 59h by\r\n    porting the patch that adds them (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed issues with the \"config -wcd -all\" command and other\r\n    updates to the CONFIG command (Wengier)\r\n  - Added [config] section in dosbox-x.conf to resemble DOS's\r\n    CONFIG.SYS file. It currently supports REM, BREAK, NUMLOCK,\r\n    FCBS, FILES, DOS, DEVICE/DEVICEHIGH, INSTALL/INSTALLHIGH,\r\n    SET and LASTDRIVE commands. The file CONFIG.SYS will appear\r\n    on the Z: drive, similar to AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The [config]\r\n    section can be bypassed with the -noconfig command-line\r\n    option or with the secure mode enabled (Wengier)\r\n  - Moved PC-98 related config options (starting with \"pc-98 \")\r\n    from [dosbox] and [dos] sections to its own [pc98] section.\r\n    These options in existing dosbox-x.conf/dosbox.conf files\r\n    will be automatically redirected to the [pc98] section from\r\n    the other sections when DOSBox-X starts (Wengier)\r\n  - The user directory DOSBox-X uses has been changed to use the\r\n    DOSBox-X directory (e.g. from ~/.dosbox to ~/.config/dosbox-x\r\n    on Linux platform). It will be read *after* the dosbox-x.conf\r\n    file in the current directory (Wengier)\r\n  - Config option \"dpi aware\" now supports the \"auto\" setting\r\n    to auto-decide on the best setting for the platform. This\r\n    fixes very small window issue on high DPI devices such as\r\n    Microsoft Surface tablets. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added DTASEG, DTAOFF, and PSPSEG as hex value constants to\r\n    the debugger interface to aid in debugging DOS programs.\r\n  - New command-line option -helpdebug added to list debug-\r\n    related command-line options. The standard -? / -h / -help\r\n    command-line option will no longer list them (Wengier)\r\n  - Implemented LFN support for FAT driver, so that it is now\r\n    possible to view directory list, create or open files and\r\n    directories etc with long filenames on FAT12/16/32 drives\r\n    just like on mounted local drives.\r\n  - FAT driver cleaned up and fixed to avoid edge cases that\r\n    can corrupt directory entries and leave lost clusters\r\n    on the disk, also fixed to always report root directory\r\n    as a directory through the GetFileAttribute INT 21h call,\r\n    needed by MOVE.EXE and XCOPY.EXE to work properly.\r\n  - IMGMOUNT auto geometry detection will assume LBA disk\r\n    and fake C/H/S geometry if the disk is 4GB or larger,\r\n    the MBR lacks executable code, or the first partition\r\n    is Windows 98-style LBA FAT16 or FAT32.\r\n  - IMGMOUNT now assumes ISO type by default if the image file\r\n    extension is .iso/.cue/.bin/.mdf. No need for \"-t iso\" in\r\n    this case; but (if applicable) it can be overridden by for\r\n    example \"-t hdd\". (Wengier)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT command (no parameters) now lists mounted FAT/ISO\r\n    drives and mounted drive numbers, also SUBST command (no\r\n    parameters) now lists mounted local drives (Wengier)\r\n  - INT AH=36h fixed to convert free space but maintain a\r\n    cluster size (bytes/sector * sectors/cluster) that is less\r\n    than 64KB to avoid divide by 0 crashes with FORMAT.COM /S\r\n  - Added FAT32 free/total disk space API for FAT driver, and\r\n    updated INT 21h AX=7303h to call it. FAT driver now provides\r\n    FAT32 extended disk free/total through FAT32 API and 2GB\r\n    limited free/total through INT 21h AH=36h for older DOS\r\n    programs. Shell DIR command updated to use FAT32 free space\r\n    API to show free space even on FAT32 partitions larger than\r\n    2GB, but only if the DOS version is set to 7.1 or higher.\r\n  - Added FAT32 INT21h and IOCTLs needed by MS-DOS 7.1/Windows 98\r\n    versions of SCANDISK.EXE and FORMAT.COM, such as DOS functions\r\n    for \"FAT32 extended\" absolute disk read and write.\r\n  - Improved FAT32 support to the FAT driver, including direct\r\n    support for FAT32 drives in the DOSBox-X command shell. Files,\r\n    directories and volume labels on FAT32 drives can be listed,\r\n    read from or written to just like on FAT12/16 drives.\r\n  - Added DOS IOCTL read/write logical device track functions so\r\n    that FORMAT.COM is able to verify and modify the partition table\r\n    to successfully format a hard drive image. Also added stub to\r\n    DOS IOCTL \"format device track\" for FORMAT.COM.\r\n  - You can now force unmount a drive and then mount it to a new\r\n    directory in one command, e.g. \"MOUNT C C:\\DOS -U\" (Wengier)\r\n  - REN command can now rename directories (in addition to files) on\r\n    FAT drives just like on local drives (Wengier)\r\n  - Several improvements to DEL command, such as a new /F option to\r\n    force delete of read-only files, and improved handling when the\r\n    argument is a directory (Wengier)\r\n  - LS command added to list directory contents. It does not support\r\n    all options as in Unix/Linux platform (Wengier)\r\n  - DIR /O & /OG supported in addition to /ON|/OE|/OS|/OD options.\r\n    Options such as /-O & /-A can be used to override /O, /A etc if\r\n    they are specified in the DIRCMD environment variable (Wengier)\r\n  - DIR and VOL commands now display real serial numbers for mounted\r\n    local drives (Windows only) and FAT drives (Wengier)\r\n  - Fixed SYS command not working properly (Wengier)\r\n  - DOS kernel INT 21h function Set File Attribute no longer\r\n    allows changing volume label attributes and fixes directory\r\n    attributes in order to prevent filesystem corruption.\r\n    This prevents Windows 95 Setup from creating WINBOOT.INI\r\n    and then changing it into a directory with the call.\r\n  - FAT driver bugs fixed where a newly created zero length file\r\n    combined with a lseek() can corrupt filesystem structures\r\n    (root directory and/or the second FAT table). This fixes\r\n    filesystem corruption when running Windows 95 install.\r\n  - Enabled printer emulation for non-Windows OSes (Linux,\r\n    Mac OS X, etc.). FreeType2 is required to enable\r\n    printer emulation at compile time.\r\n  - Added command-line option \"-o\" for MOUNT command so that\r\n    it can be specified whether to report mounted local drives\r\n    as remote (network) drives. It is \"auto\" by default just\r\n    like the virtual drive Z:.\r\n  - Added config option \"drive z is remote\" in dosbox-x.conf\r\n    to report drive Z: as a remote (network) drive. It is\r\n    \"auto\" by default, which will try to prevent SCANDISK.EXE\r\n    from Windows 9x installs to scan and \"repair\" drive Z:\r\n    which is not backed by a disk filesystem.\r\n  - Fixed clip_key_modifier setting not working when it is\r\n    set to alt, ctrl or shift in the SDL2 build. (Wengier)\r\n  - Sending \"Ctrl+Alt+Del\" key from the menu will now reset\r\n    the system within DOSBox-X when the integrated DOS or a\r\n    real DOS booted from a disk image is active. (Wengier)\r\n  - PC speaker output fixed not to timeout and stop rendering\r\n    unless the PC speaker output is not emitting anything\r\n    audible anyway (Fix for Sopwith 1 and 2).\r\n  - Added ALIAS command to define or display aliases.\r\n  - \"HELP command\" now works the same as \"command /?\" for\r\n    supported internal commands. (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved handling of quotes in some commands. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added -set command-line option to change config options.\r\n    It can be specified multiple times for multiple options,\r\n    overriding any options in the config file. For example,\r\n    the command \"dosbox-x.exe -set machine=pc98\" will force\r\n    DOSBox-X to start in PC-98 mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Re-added full drive menu items for the Windows platform.\r\n    The \"Boot from drive\" item (A:, C: and D: drives only)\r\n    should work in other platforms too. The BOOT command is\r\n    also improved to allow e.g. \"BOOT A:\" to work. (Wengier)\r\n  - INT 10h vector now points into VGA BIOS as a workaround\r\n    for DOS programs that use vector location as part of\r\n    their EGA/VGA detection. This fixes blink attribute\r\n    and EGA/VGA detection failure with SuperCalc 3 and\r\n    SuperCalc 4. This option, enabled by default, can be\r\n    disabled or enabled from dosbox-x.conf.\r\n  - Improved long filename (LFN) and SetFileAttr/GetFileAttr\r\n    support for PC-98 mode. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added config option \"lfn\" to enable/disable long filename\r\n    (LFN) support. With default setting of \"auto\", LFN support\r\n    is enabled if the reported DOS version is at least 7.0.\r\n  - Added config option \"automountall\" (default: false) to\r\n    automatically mount all available Windows drives (Wengier)\r\n  - The copy & paste Windows clipboard text via the right\r\n    mouse button feature now has support for PC-98 mode too\r\n    in addition to other modes. (Wengier)\r\n  - MPU401 IRQ fixed to properly default to 2 or 9 in IBM\r\n    PC/XT/AT mode depending on the \"enable slave pic\" config\r\n    option (rderooy)\r\n  - Fluidsynth defaults fixed for better more reliable audio\r\n    streaming on Linux and Mac OS X (Wengier and rderooy)\r\n  - Improved support for FluidSynth MIDI device by porting\r\n    code from DOSBox ECE. Set \"mididevice=fluidsynth\" along\r\n    with other required options such as \"fluid.soundfont\"\r\n    in dosbox-x.conf to use it. The previous config setting\r\n    \"mididevice=synth\" is still supported for alternative\r\n    implementation of FluidSynth. (Wengier)\r\n\r\n0.83.1\r\n  - dosbox-x.conf is now recognized as the default config\r\n    file name in addition to dosbox.conf. The sample config\r\n    file \"dosbox.reference.conf\" has been renamed to\r\n    \"dosbox-x.reference.conf\" as well (Wengier)\r\n  - Sound Blaster emulation fixed to better handle Goldplay\r\n    mode detection false positive in 1994 demoscene demo\r\n    myth_dw.zip when using Sound Blaster Pro setting in\r\n    the demo. The initial state before music starts is\r\n    like Goldplay mode, but when music actually starts the\r\n    DMA programmed to normal state without restarting\r\n    DMA playback.\r\n  - Tandy DAC output fixed to slowly ramp last sample to\r\n    zero DC sample (128) when switched off. This fixes\r\n    loud popping (DC offset) problems with Tandy DAC\r\n    sound effects in Prince of Persia. This new behavior\r\n    also seems to match real Tandy 1000 hardware according\r\n    to video captures of its audio/video outputs while\r\n    playing Prince of Persia on it.\r\n  - Tandy/PCjr 3-voice fixed to respond to I/O port 0xC0\r\n    regardless of 8-bit or 16-bit I/O (fixes Prince of\r\n    Persia).\r\n  - Write-protecting a disk image in IMGMOUNT and BOOT\r\n    commands now supported by putting a leading colon (:)\r\n    before the image file name. Works with disk swapping;\r\n    e.g. \"BOOT :C:\\DISK1.IMG C:\\DISK2.IMG\" only write-\r\n    protects C:\\DISK1.IMG but not C:\\DISK2.IMG. The new\r\n    config option \"leading colon write protect image\" can\r\n    be used to disable or enable this behavior (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for changing DOSBox-X internal time (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for pipes (|), e.g. \"DIR | MORE\" should now\r\n    work as expected; it is recommended to set the %TEMP%\r\n    (or %TMP%) environment variable to a writable directory\r\n    inside DOSBox-X before using pipes (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved redirections using \"<\" or \">\" (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved Ctrl+C handling in some commands (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved Tab completion in the command shell (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved -get & -set options for the CONFIG command,\r\n    e.g. support for config options with spaces (Wengier)\r\n  - Improved REN (or RENAME) command to support wildcards\r\n    (* and ?) in the source and/or target files (Wengier)\r\n  - Some improvements to commands like MORE & VER (Wengier)\r\n  - Added BREAK, VERIFY and TRUENAME commands as in a real\r\n    DOS system. Type \"[command] /?\" for help info (Wengier)\r\n  - Implemented FOR command to run a specified command for\r\n    each file in a set of files. Also added LFNFOR command\r\n    to control whether to use long filenames in the FOR\r\n    command as in MS-DOS 7+ (Wengier)\r\n  - Implemented ATTRIB command to view and set attributes\r\n    of files or directories (Wengier)\r\n  - Added emulation of R (readonly) attribute bit for\r\n    Linux and Unix systems through the user-writable\r\n    file mode bits of the filesystem.\r\n  - Fixed PC DOS 2000 crash during installation.\r\n  - PC speaker: Mode 3 (square wave) and a counter value\r\n    of 1 produces a low frequency square wave. Ulrasonic\r\n    frequencies do not begin until count == 2. This fixes\r\n    helicopter noises in Paratrooper.\r\n  - Fixed PC speaker emulation to allow higher PC speaker\r\n    frequencies (10x the value of pcrate) to reduce\r\n    hiss/noise/aliasing noise that occurs when games\r\n    program ultrasonic frequencies into the counter to\r\n    \"silence\" the speaker. \"Titus the Fox Marrakech and\r\n    Back\" should no longer have audible hissing noises\r\n    between beeps when the game is using the PC speaker.\r\n  - Increased DOS device limit, to avoid E_Exit() crash\r\n    if all LPT and COM devices are enabled along with\r\n    the new CLIP$ device.\r\n  - Minimum MCB free default changed to better reflect\r\n    a typical MS-DOS setup with minimal to no drivers.\r\n    This should result in a report of 600K-ish memory\r\n    free, which is equivalent to Windows 95 without\r\n    anything loaded except COMMAND.COM.\r\n  - DIR command now supports /S (search all directories)\r\n    as well as /A, /AS, /A-S, /AH, /A-H, /AR, /A-R, /AA,\r\n    /A-A options for file attribute support; Note that\r\n    DIR /A shows all files and directories whereas DIR\r\n    alone (without /A) shows all except system/hidden\r\n    ones as in a real DOS system (Wengier)\r\n  - DIR command now shows the real free disk space on\r\n    local drives. It is possible to limit this free space\r\n    for certain programs with the -freesize option of\r\n    MOUNT command. A new config option \"freesizecap\" is\r\n    added to change the behavior of this option (Wengier)\t\r\n  - DIR command fixed to show the volume label of the\r\n    drive you are listing, instead of always the current\r\n    drive (rderooy)\r\n  - Various improvements to DEL and COPY commands, e.g.\r\n    fixed the DEL /P option having no effect, and \"DEL .\"\r\n    deleted all files in the current directory silently;\r\n    the COPY command now asks for confirmation before\r\n    overwriting files, and it now supports /Y and /-Y\r\n    options to change this behavior, which can also be\r\n    set from the COPYCMD environment variable. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added or fixed help information and/or error messages\r\n    for some commands. (Wengier) \r\n  - Added support for DOS programs to communicate\r\n    with the clipboard in Windows builds. If the\r\n    \"dos clipboard device enable\" setting in\r\n    dosbox-x.conf is set to \"true\" or \"full\", a DOS\r\n    device (default name: CLIP$) will be added to\r\n    allow bidirectional communications with the\r\n    clipboard (e.g. \"DIR >CLIP$\" will write the\r\n    output to the clipboard, and \"TYPE CLIP$\" will\r\n    show the clipboard contents). Alternatively,\r\n    you can set it to \"read\" or \"write\" to allow\r\n    only read or write access for security reasons.\r\n    The DOS device name can also be changed with\r\n    the \"dos clipboard device name\" setting in\r\n    dosbox-x.conf. (Wengier)\r\n  - Added support for using the right mouse button\r\n    to copy and paste from the Windows clipboard; the\r\n    config option \"clip_key_modifier\" can be used to\r\n    change the keyboard modifier such as none, alt, ctrl,\r\n    shift, or disable this feature (default). (Wengier)\r\n  - Updated the PasteClipboard feature in SDL1 build\r\n    to support Unicode text translations; also fixed this\r\n    feature not working in SDL2 build. The config option\r\n    \"clip_paste_speed\" is added to speed up or slow down\r\n    the pasting speed for different DOS programs (Wengier)\r\n  - Support for DOSLIB2's w95sysrg/w95sysrs utils to\r\n    get/set system registry location in DOS 7+. (Wengier)\r\n  - Long filename support added, adapted from\r\n    the vDosPlus project. It will be enabled with\r\n    an initial DOS version of 7.0 or higher. (Wengier)\r\n  - Corrected return value when using option to\r\n    fake the installation of SHARE. (Allofich)\r\n  - Added code to EMS emulation to print specific\r\n    debug information when a PC-98 specific call is\r\n    made to remap segment B000h to either system\r\n    memory or video memory. I do not have enough\r\n    test cases or a setup to test what really happens,\r\n    so it will remain a debug message for now.\r\n  - Added dosbox-x.conf option to allow emulation of a\r\n    DOS environment that lacks ANSI.SYS. NOTE: The\r\n    option has no effect in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - INT 2Fh now responds to AX=1A00h which is an installation\r\n    check to report whether ANSI.SYS is resident.\r\n  - Added INT 21h debug logging for file I/O and general\r\n    INT 21h usage [patch by ognjenmi]. Added enables for\r\n    the logging which are off by default since the INT 21h\r\n    and file I/O logging are fairly noisy under normal\r\n    usage.\r\n\r\n0.83.0\r\n  - Added mt32.romdir dosbox.conf configuration option\r\n    for users who store the MT32 ROMs elsewhere other\r\n    than the current working directory.\r\n  - Configuration GUI settings menu is now vertically\r\n    divided to ensure that it fits on the screen even\r\n    if the window is at minimum size.\r\n  - PC-98 GDC status fixed to follow the explicit\r\n    definition of one bit as hblank and the other\r\n    as vsync instead of carrying over VGA port 3DAh\r\n    style logic of hblank/vblank vs vsync. This\r\n    fixes the BPS logo scanline effects in PC-98\r\n    game 'frontier-universe-bps-neo-kobe-pc98-ia'\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to select between two\r\n    known behaviors in PC-98 mode regarding the PC\r\n    speaker and the PIT timer. The default behavior\r\n    follows the newer hardware, the alternate setting\r\n    is for older games written against the PC-9801\r\n    behavior.\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option nocachedir which, when\r\n    set, instructs MOUNT to automatically act as if\r\n    -nocachedir were given.\r\n  - Linux/X11 SDL1 builds fixed not to issue resize\r\n    commands to the window to avoid fighting the\r\n    window manager. This prevents \"spastic resizing\"\r\n    under Gnome 3 in Centos 8.\r\n  - Source tree now includes build script for Linux\r\n    users who prefer Clang/LLVM over GCC.\r\n0.82.26\r\n  - Debugger console window fixed to choose a smaller\r\n    default size in Windows builds.\r\n  - Debugger console window now resizes properly\r\n    in Windows builds.\r\n  - Using F10 (step over) in the debugger to step\r\n    over INT 21h when a breakpoint for INT 21h is\r\n    set now works correctly, instead of letting the\r\n    instruction pointer \"stick\" there without moving.\r\n  - Debugger interface now shows (running/watching)\r\n    while RUNWATCH is active.\r\n  - Debugger interface now correctly shows (running)\r\n    status when F5 is used to resume emulation.\r\n  - Debugger toggle reverts back to debugger interface\r\n    instead of running state if triggered during a\r\n    RUNWATCH command.\r\n  - Fixed RUWNATCH command, which was broken by another\r\n    fix sometime back designed to stop PIC event\r\n    processing while in the debugger.\r\n  - Debugger interface fixed to keep the SDL event\r\n    handling going during the \"pager\" routine to\r\n    prevent Windows from graying out the main window\r\n    as \"not responding\" in Windows 7/8/10.\r\n  - Direct3D support has been fixed to properly render\r\n    pixel shaders again that were already written for\r\n    other forks.\r\n  - Added \"Rescan all drives\" menu command and mapper\r\n    shortcut (Issue #1379 requested by saintfrater)\r\n0.82.25\r\n  - Added 1920x1440 4:3 HD VESA BIOS mode and increased\r\n    scaler limits to support it.\r\n  - VESA BIOS emulation now rejects video modes that\r\n    exceed the render scaler architecture's limits,\r\n    to avoid frozen screens if set. However, VESAMOED.COM\r\n    warns the user, so if the user ignores the warning,\r\n    VESA BIOS emulation will allow user-defined modes\r\n    that exceed the limits anyway.\r\n  - VESAMOED.COM will now warn you if the custom mode\r\n    you modified exceeds the render scaler's limits.\r\n  - VGA emulation now reports render scaler limits\r\n    in the logfile at startup, if debug logging is\r\n    enabled.\r\n  - Render scaler code now logs a warning when it\r\n    rejects a video mode that exceeds the render\r\n    scaler limits.\r\n  - S3 emulation now allows 16MB of video memory.\r\n  - Due to continuous problems with DOS games and a\r\n    very long VESA modelist, the defaults for VESA\r\n    BIOS options in dosbox.conf have been changed to\r\n    limit the modelist to something a late 1990s\r\n    VESA BIOS would list. New defaults include a\r\n    maximum resolution of 1280x1024, the removal of\r\n    4bpp 16-color packed, unusual video modes,\r\n    \"High Definition\" TV broadcast modes, and the\r\n    extra explicitly defined 24bpp modes to complement\r\n    VBE1.2 32bpp modes. Those options remain\r\n    changeable and all limits can be lifted with\r\n    settings in dosbox.conf if wanted.\r\n  - Allow using \"\" in the debugger to specify that\r\n    a hex value should be used rather than the\r\n    contents of the flag with that name. Allows\r\n    hex values of AC, AF, CF and DF to be directly\r\n    specified. (Allofich)\r\n  - 25.COM, 28.COM, and 50.COM now have different\r\n    versions for VGA, EGA, and other IBM compatible\r\n    video machines. 28.COM now correctly sets 28 lines\r\n    for machine=ega. CGA/MDA/Hercules/etc. still use\r\n    INT AX=3h for 25.COM.\r\n  - Change 25.COM to use INT 10h AX=1114h (8x16) instead\r\n    of INT 10h AX=3 (set 80x25 mode).\r\n  - INT 10h AX=1111h (8x14) and AX=1113h (8x8), related\r\n    to 28.COM and 50.COM, now range check the current\r\n    cursor row against number of rows to keep it on\r\n    screen.\r\n  - Fixed ADDKEY \"full\" command not turning on the\r\n    full core when used with a delay. (Allofich)\r\n  - INT 10h AX=101Ah Get Video DAC color-page state fixed\r\n    to restore display after blanking it due to Attribute\r\n    Controller read and write operations. This fixes\r\n    IBM PC compatible MS-DOS game \"Blue Force\".\r\n  - Debugger: \"VGA AC\" now shows AC disable bits as well\r\n    as the internal state indicating whether the last\r\n    byte written to 3C0h was handled as the index.\r\n0.82.24\r\n  - FDC emulation now allows READ command to look for\r\n    sector numbers that are out of range in order to\r\n    support booter games that read out of range sector\r\n    numbers as part of their copy protection.\r\n  - Windows SDL1 window resizing fixed to avoid snapping\r\n    and jumping issues when the window is sized down\r\n    to the point the menu bar doubles or triples in\r\n    height due to menu item wrapping.\r\n  - FDC clear DMA terminal count automatically (with a\r\n    warning printed to the log) at beginning of FDC\r\n    read/write (PC-98 booter game Star Cruiser).\r\n  - FDC DMA read/write failure now causes FDC to signal\r\n    an error, and the debug output will say so.\r\n  - FDC debug output now shows motor bits in the correct\r\n    order, not backwards\r\n  - CONFIG.COM and MIXER.COM are now registered only at\r\n    DOS kernel startup, to resolve their disappearance\r\n    after RE-DOS or guest system reset.\r\n  - Some OpenGL cleanup and fixes for when compiling for\r\n    Mac OS X Catalina.\r\n  - Shell startup now prints the actual mapper binding\r\n    (whatever it is) for the Host key instead of assuming\r\n    F12/F11.\r\n  - \"Ro\" key in PC-98 mode in the mapper interface now\r\n    clarifies that it is Ro / _ since the shift state is\r\n    the underscore.\r\n  - Shell startup code fixed to show F11 for Windows and\r\n    F12 for other platforms properly instead of always\r\n    showing F11.\r\n  - Added BOOT option --pc98-graphics to start up with\r\n    graphics layer enabled in order to run HDI images\r\n    using QMOUSE and games that expect NEC MOUSE.COM\r\n    behavior of showing graphics layer on driver init.\r\n  - BOOT now hides graphics layer on startup in PC-98 mode\r\n    to reflect real hardware.\r\n  - INT 33h mouse emulation now enables graphics layer\r\n    on mouse startup and INT 33h AX=0 to imitate NEC\r\n    MOUSE.COM behavior seen on real PC-98 hardware. This is\r\n    needed for some Orange House games that assume this\r\n    behavior, without which the graphics are invisible.\r\n  - INT 33h define range functions now include separate\r\n    range correction for text mode vs graphics mode.\r\n  - Help sections in Configuration GUI have been improved,\r\n    they are now easier to browse and read. (aybe)\r\n  - CONFIG: added description for 'securemode' (aybe).\r\n  - Integer properties are now correctly saved when\r\n    they have been changed in configuration GUI (aybe).\r\n  - Some scenarios with command history could display\r\n    garbage characters from previous/next command (aybe).\r\n  - Fixed all hard disk images created by IMGMAKE having\r\n    VHD footers. (Allofich)\r\n  - Windows Visual Studio solution: (aybe)\r\n    - cleaned and clarified project properties for projects\r\n    - removed configurations that didn't make sense\r\n    - fixed broken debugging\r\n    - consolidated to use single versions of SDK and IDE\r\n    - enabled faster builds (multi-processor compilation)\r\n    - fixed broken builds, e.g. ARM, ARM64\r\n0.82.23\r\n  - Serial and parallel file output now disable stdio\r\n    buffering so that output is more immediately\r\n    accessible to the user.\r\n  - Added file output to serial port emulation.\r\n  - Parallel port emulation now support both dev: and\r\n    file: to specify that LPTx output go to a file,\r\n    not necessarily a device by name.\r\n  - Fixed bug that capped vmemsizekb to 8KB.\r\n  - BIOS bootup screen now shows correct text for CPU\r\n    type instead of \"? CPU\" when cputype=auto.\r\n  - PC-98 256-color mode fixed to ignore doublescan\r\n    and 200-line bits of the GDC to match real hardware\r\n    behavior. This fixes display problems with\r\n    \"Alone in the Dark\"\r\n  - BOOT command will now always set 640x200 8-color\r\n    graphics mode when booting PC-98 disk images,\r\n    to match the apparent behavior of real hardware.\r\n  - PC-98 hardware apparently allows writing port 6Ah\r\n    to jump directly to 256-color mode from 8-color\r\n    mode, update DOSBox-X emulation to allow it.\r\n    This fixes the PC-9821 port of \"Alone in the Dark\".\r\n  - Slow CGA memory access handler now wraps to 16KB\r\n    correctly, and resolves a segfault that can happen\r\n    if the last 16KB is accessed by the guest if\r\n    vmemsizekb=16.\r\n  - vmemsize default is now -1, which means to pick a\r\n    video memory size automatically.\r\n  - Added PC-98 INT 1Bh AH=03h SCSI BIOS command, which\r\n    allows FreeDOS98 to boot.\r\n  - INT 33h emulation fixed not to reset mouse min/max\r\n    range if the new video mode is a VESA BIOS SVGA\r\n    mode (not a standard VGA mode). Some games seem to\r\n    define the mouse min/max range AND THEN set the\r\n    VESA BIOS mode, not the other way around.\r\n  - INT 33h define range functions now apply rounding\r\n    to the max range if the range is close to the\r\n    dimensions of the screen, for games like Daggerfall\r\n    that set the cursor maximum range to values close to,\r\n    but not exactly, the dimensions of the VGA screen.\r\n  - INT 33h define range functions updated to accept max\r\n    ranges for mapping host to guest if set just after\r\n    video modeset or if those INT 33h functions are called\r\n    when no mouse buttons are down.\r\n  - INT 10h AH=4Fh AL=08h (Set DAC width) now correctly\r\n    set AL=4Fh to indicate the call is supported.\r\n  - VGA DAC palette writes are now ALWAYS masked to 6-bit\r\n    unless 8-BIT DAC mode is ON and enabled. This fixes\r\n    palette problems with Amulets and Armor.\r\n  - VGA DAC 6/8-bit palette management code simplified\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to instruct DOSBox-X to leave\r\n    the PC speaker clock gate enabled if set, for games\r\n    that use that PIT output as a time source. Setting\r\n    the option to \"true\" allows \"爆笑三國志\" (Bàoxiào\r\n    sānguózhì), a game with strange and elaborate timing\r\n    code, to run without hanging at the second title screen.\r\n  - VGA port 3DAh \"undefined bits\" setting changed to 0x04\r\n    to accommodate \"Blues Brothers\"\r\n  - Configuration GUI: If the settings are scrollable,\r\n    tabbing between fields will now auto-scroll to the\r\n    field and make it visible.\r\n  - In the configuration GUI, scroll wheel input no longer\r\n    changes the window focus.\r\n  - Set CPU cycles dialog box layout fixed.\r\n  - Added 'skip encoding unchanged frames' option to\r\n    dosbox.conf. If set, AVI video capture will skip\r\n    video frame compression if the frame has not changed\r\n    from the previous frame. Option is off by default\r\n    at this time in case it causes any issues with users\r\n    and their video editing software.\r\n0.82.22\r\n  - Added Normal2x render scalers so that 'force scaler'\r\n    for 1x2 or 2x1 scalefactors works and you can scale\r\n    up 320x200/640x200 VGA modes and 640x200 CGA modes\r\n    by 2x.\r\n  - Main window titlebar now reflects whether or\r\n    not the debugger interface is active.\r\n  - Debugger interface now flushes terminal input\r\n    upon entering the debugger, so that keyboard\r\n    input prior to entering the debugger is ignored.\r\n  - Debugger mapper shortcut and menu item are now\r\n    a toggle. Selecting once will enter the debugger\r\n    and selecting again will resume emulation.\r\n  - cycles=max now displays cycle percentage correctly\r\n    instead of showing e.g. 100 cyc/ms\r\n  - (Allofich) Note and ignore INT 33, AX=53C1 call\r\n    for the Logitech CyberMan.\r\n  - Fixed odd code addition that disabled (through\r\n    the configuration) XMS, EMS, and UMB when\r\n    booting a guest OS. This fixes a problem where\r\n    those services are not available when rebooting\r\n    back into the DOSBox-X shell from a guest OS.\r\n  - CGA 640x200 and MCGA 640x480 modes fixed to\r\n    have proper refresh rate when machine=mcga,\r\n    instead of 140Hz.\r\n  - MCGA horizontal active display register\r\n    encodes N - 1, not N, according to real\r\n    hardware register dumps.\r\n  - INT 10h modes 2 and 3 updated set MCGA CRTC\r\n    write protect bit, to match real PS/2 hardware\r\n    behavior, and to unlock CRTC registers during\r\n    mode set.\r\n  - PC-98 VSYNC interrupt now fires at vertical\r\n    retrace start (as documented) instead of at\r\n    active display end behavior borrowed from\r\n    DOSBox VGA emulation. This fixes \"Tonight\"\r\n    by Swat.\r\n  - Fixed mistake that placed N88 ROM BASIC stub\r\n    (something specific to PC-98) in memory even\r\n    in IBM PC/XT/AT emulation mode.\r\n  - Fixed some callback slot leaks that can cause\r\n    DOSBox-X to run out of callback slots if you\r\n    reset the guest system too much.\r\n  - Fixed invalid callback and errant interrupt\r\n    handling during BIOS reset delay that happens\r\n    if you use the keyboard shortcut to trigger\r\n    system reset.\r\n  - XMS emulation resets global enable and local\r\n    enable state on XMS emulation startup to fix\r\n    crashes related to inability to control A20 gate\r\n    after system reset or DOS kernel restart.\r\n  - Debugger \"SM\" command now accepts segment:offset\r\n    syntax for memory location to write.\r\n  - Fixed INT 21h AH=65h bug that returns DBCS table\r\n    for AH=4h that should return filename uppercase\r\n    table.\r\n  - Configuration GUI property settings are now\r\n    shown in a single column wide list with scrolling.\r\n  - In the configuration GUI, help dialogs will now\r\n    present the help text as a scrollable region if\r\n    there is too much to fit on screen.\r\n  - dosbox.conf mixer rate will now accept any\r\n    sample rate from 4KHz to 192KHz instead of only\r\n    fixed specific sample rates.\r\n  - cascade interrupt ignore in service setting now\r\n    accepts true, false, and auto. \"auto\" is now the\r\n    default, and will choose true or false depending\r\n    on machine type for correct emulation either way.\r\n    It should no longer be necessary to add\r\n    \"cascade interrupt ignore in service=true\" to\r\n    your dosbox.conf every time you want to run a\r\n    PC-98 game properly.\r\n  - PC-98 FM board emulation will now load SOUND.ROM\r\n    into segment CC00h if available, if FM board\r\n    emulation is enabled.\r\n  - PC-98 INT 18h AH=30h updated to return AH=05h\r\n    AL=00h BH=00h if success, AH=00h AL=01h BH=01h\r\n    if failure. This is needed to get Puyo Puyo 2\r\n    to work, which for some reason fails if a call\r\n    to set 15KHz mode works.\r\n  - PC-98 LIO and SOUND BIOS entry points, while\r\n    still not implemented, have been updated to\r\n    print the name of the call according to an\r\n    online reference.\r\n  - DOS FCB rename now supports renaming the\r\n    volume label as MS-DOS does.\r\n  - Fixed bug that prevented proper DOS FCB rename\r\n    if the FCB used to rename is extended.\r\n  - FAT filesystem driver updated to also store\r\n    updated volume label in the boot sector of the\r\n    partition, as per MS-DOS FAT standards.\r\n  - FCB create can now be used to set a FAT\r\n    filesystem label. MS-DOS LABEL.EXE works\r\n    correctly now.\r\n  - FAT filesystem driver now allows LABEL command\r\n    to change the FAT volume label of mounted disk\r\n    images.\r\n  - DOS kernel updated to support basic FCB methods\r\n    of deleting/setting the volume label, at least\r\n    on local folder mounts.\r\n  - DOS kernel will now return the volume label of\r\n    FAT filesystems mounted from disk images.\r\n  - LABEL setting code fixed not to treat label as\r\n    if an 8.3 filename.\r\n  - LABEL is no longer a builtin shell command and\r\n    appears on drive Z: as LABEL.COM\r\n  - LABEL reimplemented to imitate MS-DOS behavior\r\n    with regard to how it handles the command line.\r\n  - File I/O checking and cleanup (Allofich)\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Handle errant IRQs as a real BIOS does. Also\r\n    remove r3263 workaround, as it's no longer\r\n    needed.\r\n    - Fix flag behavior of several shift/rotate\r\n    instructions, cause exceptions and fix\r\n    potential 'pop ss' problems\r\n    - Add support for Print Screen key and\r\n    interrupt. In-game screenshot feature\r\n    of Descent and Descent 2 now works.\r\n0.82.21\r\n  - Reduced title bar size of the Configuration GUI.\r\n  - Fixed sizing and positions of some Help menu dialog\r\n    boxes in the Configuration GUI.\r\n  - Configuration GUI issues with help text and word\r\n    wrap running off the edge of the window have been\r\n    fixed.\r\n  - INT 21h AX=3702h AVAILDEV returns DL=FFh to match\r\n    MS-DOS behavior.\r\n  - Added INT 21h AX=6523h, for Microsoft software\r\n    that uses it after prompting the user for a Y/N\r\n    answer such as FORMAT.COM and FDISK.EXE\r\n  - PC-98 MS-DOS kernel now writes fake INT 1Bh device\r\n    list to 60:6C to satisfy certain games that need\r\n    it for their \"master disk\" detection.\r\n  - Fixed FAT driver bug that caused the allocation\r\n    of an extra cluster if writing a file that is\r\n    exactly a multiple of the cluster size long.\r\n  - FAT driver now assigns current date/time when\r\n    creating directories.\r\n  - Increased the DTA segment size of the DOS FAT driver\r\n    to fix problems with directory searches corrupting\r\n    adjacent memory.\r\n  - Disk Parameter Block linked list now terminates\r\n    with next pointer at FFFF:FFFF instead of 0000:0000\r\n    to match general DOS pattern and satisfy some\r\n    PC-98 games that enumerate the list.\r\n  - INT AH=52h List of Lists now points to the Disk\r\n    Parameter Block as well, which allows some PC-98\r\n    games that enumerate the list to work.\r\n  - Video parameter list and table at BIOS DATA AREA\r\n    40:A8 added to MCGA mode, to match real PS/2 MCGA\r\n    hardware.\r\n  - FAT driver now updates the Disk Parameter\r\n    Block when activated, and provides as much\r\n    from the FAT filesystem as possible. It is now\r\n    possible to run Microsoft MS-DOS 6.22\r\n    SCANDISK.EXE on a drive letter attached from\r\n    a disk image.\r\n  - Disk Parameter Block is now the proper full\r\n    size. The limited 9 bytes/block hackery has\r\n    been removed.\r\n  - Added INT 25h/INT 26h emulation for FAT drives\r\n    mounted with IMGMOUNT.\r\n  - Fake disk parameter table fixed to indicate one\r\n    reserved sector.\r\n  - Fixed INT 25h/INT 26h to return an error rather than\r\n    silently fail with success. Emulation of these calls\r\n    exist currently only as stubs and, according to\r\n    source comments, as a workaround for MicroProse\r\n    installers. For disk diagnostic software like\r\n    Microsoft ScanDisk it is better to signal an error\r\n    until INT 25h/INT 26h are fully implemented.\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to control whether INT 10h\r\n    VESA BIOS function AX=4F00h (Get SVGA information)\r\n    zeros the entire 256-byte or 512-byte structure or\r\n    not. Turning the option off (no zeroing) allows\r\n    \"Get Saddam!\" to run with SVGA and VESA BIOS\r\n    extensions enabled without crashing. The developer\r\n    calls INT AX=4F00h but does not provide enough\r\n    storage space for the full 256 byte structure,\r\n    only enough for the base structure defined by VESA.\r\n  - INT 2Fh updated to explicitly mention SMARTDRV or\r\n    DBLSPACE if values of AX are known to match their\r\n    API.\r\n  - VESA BIOS modelist now includes S3 OEM video modes\r\n    as documented by the RBIL, and needed by Line Wars II.\r\n  - OpenGL output now clears 3 frames instead of 2 after\r\n    mode change to deal with nVidia hardware that\r\n    reportedly triple buffers OpenGL rendering in\r\n    Windows.\r\n  - INT 21h fixed to always enable the A20 gate through\r\n    HIMEM.SYS if dosbox.conf indicates a configuration where\r\n    XMS is enabled, the HMA is enabled, and DOS is loaded\r\n    high (DOS=HIGH), which is the default configuration\r\n    for DOSBox-X.\r\n  - XMS emulation fixed not to allow conventional memory\r\n    block addresses (source or dest) if it extends past\r\n    the 1MB+64KB-16 range normally accessible from real\r\n    mode, as per Microsoft XMS test program.\r\n  - XMS emulation fixed to disallow XMS block move/copy\r\n    with an odd length byte count, per Microsoft XMS\r\n    specification.\r\n  - XMS emulation no longer allows freeing a XMS block\r\n    handle that is still locked, as per Microsoft XMS\r\n    specification and testing software.\r\n  - Enhance existing INT 68h fix for \"PopCorn\" by adding\r\n    a dosbox.conf option to always keep INT 68h NULL,\r\n    so that it's possible to run the game in machine\r\n    configurations other than CGA.\r\n  - EGA/VGA: Fix \"dynamic parameter save area\" pointer,\r\n    to make sure it's initialized to zero properly.\r\n    This is needed to run \"Get Saddam!\" in VGA mode\r\n    without crashing.\r\n  - INT 10h AH=12h BL=10h no longer responds in\r\n    machine=mcga mode, which allows Thexder to run in\r\n    256-color mode properly when emulating MCGA.\r\n  - Added code to silence the PC speaker, if it was left\r\n    on at reset, at BIOS POST.\r\n  - Added pause at BIOS POST (after reset), with\r\n    dosbox.conf option to control, so that screen contents\r\n    at reset can be seen.\r\n  - Writes to unmapped 0xE0000-0xE7FFF in PC-98 mode no\r\n    longer print a \"write to ROM\" warning. PC-98 games\r\n    and software like to zero that region whether or not\r\n    the 4th bitplane is enabled.\r\n  - PC speaker emulation now takes into consideration\r\n    the case when the 8254 timer has been given a control\r\n    word without a counter value, in which case no sound\r\n    is to be emitted until a control word is written.\r\n    This fixes \"Titus the Fox: To Marrakech and Back\"\r\n    when the game fails to detect Adlib (OPL2) hardware.\r\n  - Adlib polling hack no longer needed.\r\n  - Floppy controller emulation fixed to support sector\r\n    sizes other than 512 bytes per sector.\r\n  - Floppy controller fixed to always set \"seek completed\"\r\n    status bit after seek/calibrate, not just when the\r\n    head hits track 0 (programming mistake).\r\n  - PC-98 40-column text mode is now supported.\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - In the mapper, display disabled items or events\r\n    with no binding in grey. \r\n    - Implemented BIOS beep sound for ASCII character 7\r\n    - Return failure for INT 13 format calls if the\r\n    drive is inactive.\r\n0.82.20\r\n  - Dynamic core IMUL instruction mistake fixed,\r\n    signed multiply works properly again.\r\n  - PC-98 graphics emulation fixed to render only the\r\n    number of active display lines programmed into\r\n    the GDC instead of matching the text layer. This\r\n    fixes the status bar at the bottom of the screen\r\n    in \"First Queen\" and \"First Queen II\".\r\n  - Normal CPU core fixed not to immediately process\r\n    interrupts on STI but to wait a little bit so that\r\n    a STI + CLI sequence does not cause interrupt\r\n    processing, according to real Intel 486 behavior.\r\n  - Unknown interrupts in PC-98 mode are now routed by\r\n    the DOS kernel through it's segment (60h) and back\r\n    to the BIOS through a JMP instruction. It appears\r\n    some TSRs for PC-98 determine whether or not\r\n    interrupts are in use by whether or not the segment\r\n    value is pointing at the DOS kernel (segment 60h).\r\n  - Re-added a20=fast by popular demand, though a20=mask\r\n    is still the default. a20=fast emulates the A20 gate\r\n    the way a virtual 8086 mode monitor does where only\r\n    the first 64KB past 1MB is remapped rather than\r\n    gating bit 20 of all addresses. Note that a20=fast\r\n    also matches the A20 gate behavior in DOSBox SVN.\r\n  - Bringing up the SDL drawn menus and then resizing the\r\n    window no longer \"freezes\" the display in SDL2 builds.\r\n  - IDE emulation now minimally emulates PC-98 I/O port\r\n    arrangement in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - Running a build that draws its own menus, setting\r\n    output=opengl, and hiding the menus no longer causes\r\n    lag redrawing the screen every time the mouse cursor\r\n    moves.\r\n  - Memory limit is now 3.5GB for 64-bit builds and 1GB for\r\n    32-bit builds.\r\n  - Maximum memory limit is now 3.5GB, code fixed to better\r\n    enforce the limit.\r\n  - Mixer and VGA capture code fixed to signal error if the\r\n    memory address exceeds the amount of system memory.\r\n    The general design of DOSBox-X memory I/O means that if\r\n    physical memory writes are made beyond system memory,\r\n    DOSBox-X will write out of bounds and segfault.\r\n  - DOSBox Integration device now offers the program inside\r\n    to capture the VGA output, for automated testing.\r\n  - DOSBox Integration device now offers reading emulator\r\n    time (PIC_FullIndex()) and setting a watchdog timer\r\n    that triggers an NMI unless reset. Intended for use\r\n    with automated testing.\r\n  - Debugger INTHAND command now works properly in protected\r\n    mode.\r\n  - DOSBox Integration Device now provides an interface for\r\n    code within to listen to the mixer output (to hear\r\n    itself) for automated testing purposes.\r\n  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation fixed not to run or compute\r\n    voices and ramps if the DAC enable bit is not set.\r\n  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation now offers a hack to ignore\r\n    writes to the Active Channel register if the DAC is active\r\n    and rendering audio (Ice Fever demoscene hack).\r\n  - SDL drawn menus fixed not to interact or draw while 3Dfx\r\n    emulation is using OpenGL, to prevent it from disturbing\r\n    the OpenGL context for 3Dfx emulation.\r\n  - NMI interrupt handling fixes to resolve instruction pointer\r\n    corruption if NMI interrupt triggered while a CPU core is\r\n    executing instructions (i.e. triggered by I/O handler).\r\n  - DOSBox-X integration device now provides an interface to\r\n    trigger IRQ and NMI signals.\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Improve disk image mounting: cycle disks only for the\r\n    drive being mounted.\r\n    - FAT drive fixes and improvements. Identify floppy format,\r\n    and support filesystems that use only part of the disk.\r\n    Fixes Make Your Own Murder Party and Music/Pinball\r\n    Construction Set.\r\n    - Return correct error code for verify sectors function\r\n    when an invalid drive is specified. Fixes Hugo Troll game\r\n    installers.\r\n    - Prefer ncurses above curses (on some systems, these are\r\n    still different packages)\r\n    - Give a warning at startup if dpi scaling is detected.\r\n    - Show segment override on XLAT instruction.\r\n    - Change scan3x to be LINE LINE DARK instead of LINE DARK\r\n    DARK. This matches pictures of scanlines better and doubles\r\n    the brightness as the old implementation was rather dark.\r\n    - Make it possible to compile without PNG support.\r\n    - Report when a -conf file can not be loaded.\r\n    - When searching CD-ROM directory entries, strip trailing\r\n    period of extension-less filenames after stripping file\r\n    version number and separator. Fixes disc check in Air Power.\r\n    - Add Unit Number and Bytes Per Sector fields for DPB\r\n    entries. Fixes Air Power installer and Windows 3 Virtual\r\n    Memory dialog.\r\n    - Reset write ops after drawing text in EGA graphics modes,\r\n    consistent with EGA/VGA BIOS. Fixes Fun School 3.\r\n    - Make Allocation Info work for CD-ROM drives. Fixes Bureau\r\n    13 installer.\r\n    - Prevent double-loading of CD-ROM images.\r\n    - Don't generate sound after DMA is masked at end of single\r\n    cycle transfer. Prevents issues with some games.\r\n    - Use right field when dealing with joysticks.\r\n    - Check for both read-only modes when writing files to drive\r\n    - Correct one-off error in paging table size compare for\r\n    when not using USE_FULL_TLB\r\n    - Make CMOS equipment list startup display mode bits differ\r\n    from BIOS on EGA/VGA. Fixes Sauro.\r\n    - Implement port 62h with timer 2 output for CGA and\r\n    Hercules machine types; fixes Frank Bruno's Boxing and Math\r\n    Maze.\r\n    - Acknowledge mouse interrupt before entering user routine;\r\n    fixes sound stutter during mouse movement in Eye of the\r\n    Beholder III and Casino Tournament of Champions. Clear\r\n    button counters in the mouse driver reset function;\r\n    prevents unintended skipping of intro in MechWarrior and\r\n    others.\r\n    - Correct relative track length in subchannel data for\r\n    CD-ROM images; fixes speech audio cutting off too soon in\r\n    Casino Tournament of Champions.\r\n    - Reset followed by switch to UART mode should take some\r\n    time; fixes MPU detection in F29 Retaliator and Hover Force.\r\n    - Ignore unrequested data in intelligent mode; fixes Roland\r\n    sound in Krusty's Fun House.\r\n    - Repair double slash in configfile location on Macs.

Use this to add an optional parameter to\r\n    sensitivity which controls the y axis. When optional\r\n    parameter is missing, x and y axis have the same value.\r\n    Change limits on sensitivity to allow for negative values\r\n    so the Mouse Y-axis can be inversed.\r\n    - Correct bug related to signedness.\r\n    - Improve prefetch and simple cores to not switch to normal\r\n    core on trap execution. Fixes the demo version of\r\n    Prehistorik 2 and similar cases that use the trap flag and\r\n    prefetch tricks.\r\n    - Check lengths before adding C-style strings together.\r\n    - Fix unmounting of complex drives where parts were left and\r\n    file pointers were kept open.\r\n    - Stop storing raw modrm value. Should save an instruction\r\n    on each get_modrm call.\r\n    - Strip leading = from value. Can happen if you execute\r\n    \"irq =5\".\r\n    - Don't remove bytes from autoexec.bat when changing\r\n    settings from autoexec.bat, but replace them instead. This\r\n    way the location stays valid.\r\n    - Let dynamic core recompile interrupt instructions in\r\n    non-debug builds. Can help software with many INTs, such as\r\n    compiled BASIC, run faster.\r\n    - Add logic in mouse driver to ignore button events that\r\n    are out of sequence. Fixes International Rugby Challenge\r\n    when clicking to lock the mouse.\r\n    - Use a more compatible offset for DOS redirected interrupt\r\n    vector. Works around a null pointer bug in the notes dropdown\r\n    list of Jack the Ripper.\r\n    - Rewrite pop_ev so it can trigger pagefaults again. Fixes\r\n    Win 3.11.\r\n    - Fix uninitialized access to some isoDrive fields. Pause audio\r\n    before switching. Use right subunit with multiple CDs on one\r\n    drive letter.\r\n    - Move all stack alignment operations into one place and\r\n    some optimalisations to RISC x64 dynamic core.\r\n    - Merged in MAME sound from mainline, except for Tandy sound. \r\n0.82.19\r\n  - Prefetch core fixed up, made more aggressive, and string\r\n    instructions (REP MOVSW) cause more prefetch. \"Stereotype\"\r\n    demoscene production can run again.\r\n  - DOSBox Integration device now allows ISA DMA read/write\r\n    injection.\r\n  - 8237 DMA emulation now supports PC-98 \"auto bank increment\"\r\n    functions, which automatically increments the DMA page number\r\n    on DMA wraparound. Sim City 2000 needs this to play it's\r\n    digitized sound effects properly.\r\n  - 8237 DMA emulation now enforces read/write mode provided by\r\n    guest. If the DMA is configured for reading from system\r\n    memory, then attempts to WRITE to memory via DMA must fail.\r\n    Just like real hardware.\r\n  - 8237 DMA block transfer cleanup, de-duplication.\r\n  - 8237 DMA block cleanup allows implementation of 8/16-bit DMA,\r\n    forwards and backwards.\r\n  - PC-98 keyboard corrections (not yet verified to be accurate\r\n    to hardware though) to solve problems where holding a key\r\n    while running a program that is slow to respond to input\r\n    can overrun the buffer and fail to handle additional input.\r\n  - VGA BIOS size changed to 0x4000 (16KB), because 0x3800\r\n    is not liked by Windows 3.0.\r\n  - Font vector is now INT 44h for PCjr and Tandy emulation,\r\n    INT 43h otherwise as documented in the RBIL.\r\n  - Graph key (PC-98 mode) no longer registers as keyboard\r\n    input to INT 18h. EDIT.COM's menu is now usable.\r\n  - PC-98 INT 18h AH=02h fixed to return the correct keyboard\r\n    status byte as documented\r\n  - Local directory filesystem support now applies timestamp\r\n    before closing the file handle, which should help with\r\n    timestamps even if the filename is not directly valid\r\n    on the host operating system or filesystem.\r\n  - DOSBox Integration Device moved to I/O port DB28h-DB2Bh\r\n    in PC-98 mode to avoid conflicts with DMA controller\r\n    registers.\r\n  - DMA controller is now completely disabled in IBM PCjr mode\r\n    (machine=pcjr) to match real hardware.\r\n  - COPY command now copies file date/time as well.\r\n  - INT 2Fh AX=1600h no longer logs an error as unimplemented.\r\n    (Allofich)\r\n  - COPY.EXE removed, so that the built-in COPY command can work.\r\n  - PC98UTIL fixed to re-enable the text layer after the BIOS call\r\n    for /24khz and /31khz options.\r\n  - PC-98 INT 18h AH=30h now allows setting the 480-line mode.\r\n  - (PC-98) Port 6Ah command 40h/41h, CRT vs Plasma/LCD mode,\r\n    added.\r\n  - PC98UTIL.COM now updates the menu item for PC-98 GDC clock\r\n    speed when changing GDC clock speed.\r\n  - Added to PC98UTIL.COM the /24khz and /31khz switches to change\r\n    hsync rate.\r\n  - Updated PC-98 graphics plane emulation to more properly\r\n    handle the 5MHz GDC mode, and the IM bit in the GDC parameter\r\n    RAM.\r\n  - INT 18h AH=30h and AH=42h mode set fixed to update CPU and\r\n    display pages correctly.\r\n  - INT 18h AH=30h (PC-98 mode) now permits graphics layer changes.\r\n  - INT 18h AH=30h (PC-98 mode) now permits changing hsync rate.\r\n  - INT 18h AH=31h (PC-98 mode) now uses BIOS data area to\r\n    return hsync rate (24KHz vs 31KHz)\r\n  - INT 18h AH=42h (PC-98 mode) now uses BIOS data area to\r\n    determine 5MHz GDC instead of internal state to better emulate\r\n    actual hardware behavior.\r\n  - PC-98 text console output now fills both cells of doublewide\r\n    characters on the text layer.\r\n  - PC-98 port 6Ah now handles command 82h/83h and 84h/85h which\r\n    allow the guest to reprogram the GDC clock frequency (2.5MHz\r\n    or 5MHz). This is necessary to handle strange Windows 3.1\r\n    behavior where entering a DOS program fullscreen causes\r\n    Windows 3.1 to reprogram your GDC to run at 5MHz regardless of\r\n    the BIOS (or dosbox.conf) setting.\r\n  - PC-98 port 68h now supports command 0Eh/0Fh to enable display.\r\n  - Integrated commits from mainline (Allofich)\r\n    - Lower the influence of the aspect table correction\r\n    trick when using high scale factors (320x200 => 2000x1200).\r\n    - Correction done to Hercules video height parameter.\r\n    - The mapper now uses the wrapper as well\r\n    - Fix the possible/suggested values for integer\r\n    properties.\r\n    - Do less to update the frequency of an active SB\r\n    DMA transfer.

Use with\r\n    MS-DOS and a DOS extender (DOS4GW, etc) should be OK.\r\n\r\n  - Added \"--boothax <mode>\" option to BOOT command. At this\r\n    time <mode> is limited to \"msdos\" to instruct the emulation\r\n    to intercept specific INT 21h calls to locate the MS-DOS\r\n    kernel's List of List and MCB chain structures for use with\r\n    the debugger.\r\n  - \"TV\" scaler updated to render dimmer alternate scanlines\r\n    in CGA graphics modes (frank-deng)\r\n  - Direct3D output no longer leaves DOS screen frozen when\r\n    Direct3D device is \"lost\" (such as hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL\r\n    to bring up the Windows C+A+D screen).\r\n  - Page fault handling on by default now for dynamic core,\r\n    DOS games and Windows 3.1 seem to handle it OK.\r\n  - Page fault handling no longer use non-recursive page fault\r\n    method with dynamic core, no matter what. It's too unreliable.\r\n  - PC-98 mode now switches PIT Timer 2 clock gate ON by default\r\n    to satisfy delay loops in Sunsoft \"Photo Genic\" and allow it\r\n    to run. Note that PIT Timer 2 drives the baud rate clock of\r\n    the RS-232C port.\r\n  - IDE emulation bug fixed that prevented BIOS to IDE\r\n    geometry translation when BIOS head count == 255. This\r\n    fix also allows Windows 95 to use its IDE driver with\r\n    >= 4GB hard drives instead of running in MS-DOS compatibility\r\n    mode.\r\n  - Disk image support fixed to allow 4GB or larger hard disk\r\n    images to work again.\r\n  - FPU x86 core no longer calls E_Exit if the FPU stack\r\n    overflows or underflows.\r\n  - Updated build-debug scripts to accept \"32\" on the command\r\n    line as a sign to compile 32-bit (i686) on a 64-bit (x86_64)\r\n    system. You will need a multilib-capable GCC and 32-bit\r\n    libraries installed on your system for this to work.\r\n  - SDL2 OpenGL fixed color order issue\r\n  - OpenGL is now supported in SDL2 builds.\r\n  - Changed MPU-401 reset duration (DOSBox SVN).\r\n0.82.16\r\n  - SDL1 support fixed to gracefully handle a case where,\r\n    under Windows XP, with an audio device that is not cycling\r\n    any audio DMA, DOSBox-X can hang on shutdown.\r\n  - SDL drawn menus now shift and adjust popup menu position\r\n    to ensure the popup is entirely within the screen in cases\r\n    where the window is too small. Redraw issues related to\r\n    that (overlapping item and popup menus) have been fixed.\r\n    Minimum window resolution has been reduced to 500x300,\r\n    enough to permit EGA 640x350 displays without a black\r\n    border.\r\n  - Fixed INT 18h AH=13h not to automatically show the cursor\r\n    (PC-98 fix), which fixes the visible blinking cursor\r\n    problem during games.\r\n  - VS2017 project files can now compile DOSBox-X to run on\r\n    ARM versions of Windows RT (driver1998)\r\n  - Local filesystem support fixed to sanitize DOS dates\r\n    before applying them to files on the host filesystem\r\n    so that invalid dates within DOSBox-X do not make invalid\r\n    dates on the host filesystem.\r\n  - VS2017 project files can now compile DOSBox-X to run on\r\n    ARM64 versions of Windows 10 (driver1998)\r\n  - Fixed FAT driver programming mistake (inherited from\r\n    DOSBox SVN) that used the Windows 95 \"Created\" date/time\r\n    stamp rather than the original MS-DOS \"Modified\" date/time\r\n    stamp field.\r\n  - FAT driver now allows setting file date/time properly\r\n    on create or INT 21h call to set date/time, and updates\r\n    date/time on close after writing the file. Copy a file\r\n    to a disk image should preserve the date, and new files\r\n    created on the disk image should no longer have the\r\n    date/time stamp Jan 1st, 1980 12:00:00 AM midnight.\r\n  - Configuration GUI now allows user to exit dialog boxes\r\n    and windows by hitting the ESC key.\r\n  - Entering the mapper UI on Mac OS X will now hide all but\r\n    the Host Key button on the touch bar. Entering the\r\n    Configuration GUI will hide all buttons.\r\n  - If DOSBox-X is run on a platform where the GUI provides\r\n    a menu resource, bringing up the mapper will replace the\r\n    main menu with a mapper-specific menu until you exit the\r\n    mapper. Same for the configuration GUI.\r\n  - Mapper now allows user to exit by hitting ESC key three\r\n    times in a row.\r\n  - Windows MinGW builds now properly support and enable the\r\n    Direct3D output\r\n  - Mac OS X builds now contain the correct version number in\r\n    the application plist. Using the Finder's Information window\r\n    on the compiled application bundle will now show correct\r\n    version information.\r\n  - SDL1 builds fixed to always compile with internal SDL_net\r\n    library instead of public library on the system\r\n  - Mac OS X SDL1 builds fixed to always clip the desktop\r\n    dimensions against the available video modes provided\r\n    by the system to avoid problems with the 1080i/1080p\r\n    modes listed in the System Preferences dialog and older\r\n    HDTV LCD TVs with lower than 1920x1080 native resolution.\r\n  - \"unmask keyboard on int 16 read\" option is on by default,\r\n    to allow DOSBox-X to keep the keyboard working with\r\n    Windows 3.11 Windows for Workgroups.\r\n  - Added multi-monitor support and detection for Mac OS X.\r\n  - Fixed problem on multi-monitor Linux/X11 setups where going\r\n    fullscreen on the primary monitor leaves the non-fullscreen\r\n    window sticking out on the adjacent monitor.\r\n  - Windows SDL1 builds fixed so that on multi-monitor setups,\r\n    going fullscreen will fill the monitor the window is\r\n    placed on.\r\n  - Added support for multi-monitor and DPI determination for\r\n    Microsoft Windows.\r\n  - SDL1 and SDL2 builds now examine multi-monitor setups and\r\n    so that they can go fullscreen properly on one monitor\r\n    instead of going fullscreen across all monitors, in\r\n    Linux/X11.\r\n  - SDL1 OpenGL code fixed not to leave a blank space at the\r\n    top of the screen when going fullscreen (if the menus are\r\n    SDL drawn menus).\r\n  - SDL1 library modified to center cursor properly no matter\r\n    where on the overall desktop the fullscreen window exists.\r\n  - Multi-monitor and fullscreen support added for Linux/X11\r\n    versions of SDL1 DOSBox-X.\r\n  - For non-x86 targets, or x86 targets where the user prefers\r\n    not to use the x86 FPU core, code has been added to emulate\r\n    the FPU instructions and registers using the \"long double\"\r\n    data type for full 80-bit precision. This fixes 3D glitches\r\n    in \"Explora\" though it still doesn't pass the Intel i387\r\n    test program.\r\n  - PC-98 INT 18h AH=04h: Added software delay to slow down some\r\n    older PC-98 games that poll keyboard/mouse while animating\r\n    cutscenes. The games seem to be timed around the assumption\r\n    that this call has some delay to it. This fixes problems with\r\n    \"Shangrlia\" by Elf corporation and animation that runs way\r\n    too fast.\r\n0.82.15\r\n  - Incorporated x86 FPU emulation from DOSBox SVN to improve FPU\r\n    precision at least on x86 and x86_64 targets.\r\n  - PC-98 port 6Ah fixed not to allow setting EGC enable unless\r\n    another EGC enable bit has been set, as specified in the PC-9801\r\n    bible.\r\n  - SVGA mode 0x10A (text mode) fixed to display properly instead\r\n    of only the top half.\r\n  - BIOS keyboard handling fixed in PC-98 mode so that Shift+Ro\r\n    types an underscore as expected.\r\n  - SVGA emulation (Tseng ET4000 and S3) fixed to reflect real\r\n    hardware behavior where BYTE/WORD/DWORD VGA bits in the CRTC\r\n    are ignored in SVGA modes.\r\n  - Added \"debug page flip\" and \"debug retrace poll\" options to\r\n    the menu.\r\n  - Added \"Swap Floppy\" and \"Swap CD\" commands to the menu.\r\n  - INT 2Eh (MS-DOS command interpreter interrupt) fixed so that\r\n    the segment value of the interrupt vector matches the PSP\r\n    segment of COMMAND.COM. Some DOS applications rely on that\r\n    segment value as a starting point to enumerate the MCB\r\n    chain.\r\n  - PC speaker emulation fixed not to print \"queue overrun\"\r\n    messages if the game or demo is attempting to use the PC\r\n    speaker while pcspeaker=off. \r\n  - PC speaker emulation fixed to improve accuracy and to ensure\r\n    the square wave is synchronized to the 8254 PIT output.\r\n    This change appears to have improved sound quality with\r\n    PWM \"digitized speech\" output.\r\n  - 8254 emulation fixed to improve overall accuracy\r\n  - 8254 PIT timer emulation fixed not to report writes to PIT 0\r\n    Timer counters if the game is writing the same value\r\n    repeatedly.\r\n  - 8254 PIT timer connected to PC speaker now handles new counter\r\n    value without causing full reset of the square wave (mode 3),\r\n    which allows DOSBox-X to pass all tests in DOSLIB.\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to control bus speed (and therefore\r\n    I/O delay) of the C-BUS in PC-98 mode. Added defaults\r\n    appropriate to PC-98 mode according to bus speeds documented\r\n    for PC-98.\r\n  - Timer clock gate emulation fixed to work properly in PC-98\r\n    mode as well as IBM PC mode, when the PC speaker clock is\r\n    enabled or disabled. This includes resetting the counter\r\n    on the 8254 when the clock gate (trigger pin) is turned off\r\n    [DOSLIB test TPCRAPI6.EXE]\r\n  - Introductory text now indicates whether the build was\r\n    compiled against SDL1 or SDL2 (emendelson)\r\n  - Windows SDL1 builds now remember window position even when\r\n    entering/leaving fullscreen mode.\r\n  - \"Restart DOSBox-X\" menu and command code removed.\r\n  - Linux/X11 window focus fixup. The change in 0.82.14 broke\r\n    main window focus handling entirely by forgetting to check\r\n    for the \"window manager\" window handle.\r\n0.82.14\r\n  - Windows builds, if run on Windows 7 or higher, will now direct\r\n    the task bar preview to show only the part of the window\r\n    containing the DOS screen.\r\n  - SDL1 Mac OS X builds fixed to remember window position even\r\n    if going to or from fullscreen mode.\r\n  - Fixed mistakes with SDL2 surface output that caused serious\r\n    UI problems with fullscreen mode and fullresolution=original.\r\n  - Fixed problems with SDL1 Mac OS X and the window/dock menu\r\n    filling up with multiple windows that have long ceased to\r\n    exist.\r\n  - SDL1 Mac OS X startup code replaced with startup code from\r\n    SDL2 in order to run from main() cleanly instead of running\r\n    SDL_main from an OS X event callback. This also fixes the\r\n    problem of an unresponsive menu on startup if run from the\r\n    terminal.\r\n  - SDL1 Mac OS X builds fixed not to destroy and recreate the\r\n    window every time it is resized.\r\n  - SDL1 Mac OS X builds fixed to keep the window position\r\n    stable every time you resize or do anything to trigger\r\n    window recreation. Resizing the window no longer causes it\r\n    to re-center to your screen.\r\n  - SDL initialization fixed not to bail out on startup if\r\n    DOSBox-X is unable to initialize SDL1 CD-ROM support (ccawley2011)\r\n  - Segfault fixed (NULL pointer de-reference) that\r\n    occurs when running DOSBox SVN on anything older than\r\n    Mojave. DOSBox-X was not affected but the fix was applied\r\n    just the same because the possibility is there.\r\n  - Configuration GUI fixed to fade out with the right color\r\n    RGBA order on Mac OS X.\r\n  - Mac OS X SDL1 builds fixed to ignore mouse movement that\r\n    occurs outside the window, unless any buttons are held\r\n    down.\r\n  - Mac OS X RGBA color order error with output=opengl fixed.\r\n    EGA/CGA/MDA/Hercules/etc. modes should display properly\r\n    now on OS X with OpenGL output.\r\n  - SDL1 builds for Mac OS X now use the full Application\r\n    menu generated by SDL1 instead of just an About command.\r\n  - SDL1 builds under Mac OS X now support the \"touch bar\"\r\n    on Macbook Pro and offer a few basic shortcuts,\r\n    including a few that the touch bar makes much more\r\n    inconvenient to use since the function key row is\r\n    virtual on the touch bar instead of physical.\r\n  - SDL1 builds under Mac OS X now offer a few basic\r\n    DOSBox-X shortcuts if you command-click or double-tap\r\n    the application icon in the dock.\r\n  - Added support for taskbar extensions offered by\r\n    Windows 7 and higher that allow DOSBox-X to put\r\n    additional buttons in the preview pane that appears\r\n    when you hover over DOSBox-X in the taskbar.\r\n  - Centos 7 SDL1 builds (Linux X11) can now go fullscreen\r\n    properly, instead of making the user input devices\r\n    unusable running in an endless loop.\r\n  - Windows builds now include Mapper and Configuration GUI\r\n    commands in the system menu.\r\n0.82.13\r\n  - Mac OS X SDL2 builds now use the native OS X menu\r\n    system instead of the \"SDL drawn\" menus.\r\n  - Mac OS X SDL1 builds now default to the OpenGL\r\n    output (if compiled with OpenGL support). Under\r\n    recent versions of OS X, OpenGL output gives\r\n    better performance than surface (CGBitmap) based\r\n    display.\r\n  - SDL2 builds now have working XBRZ scaler support.\r\n  - Mac OS X SDL2 builds updated to completely ignore\r\n    touch events, because SDL2 sees the touchpad on\r\n    Macbooks as a touchscreen. Prior to this fix, the\r\n    DOSBox-X UI was unusable due to mixed input events\r\n    from both the touchpad and the mouse input from the\r\n    touchpad.\r\n  - SDL1 High DPI support for Mac OS X users with Retina\r\n    displays.\r\n  - SDL1 fix for display problems (blank windows) on Mac\r\n    OS X 10.14.x (Mojave).\r\n  - Windows builds (compiled with VS2017) now have working\r\n    MT32 (Munt) emulation.\r\n  - Adjusting CPU cycles with F12 + - / F12 + + (Increment\r\n    and Decrement Cycles shortcuts) now updates cpu cycles\r\n    property. This fixes a problem where adjusting the cycle\r\n    count then changing the CPU core caused DOSBox-X to reset\r\n    the cycle count back to the original value.\r\n  - Linux/X11 support fixed not to assume XRandR extensions\r\n    are present, but to instead ask the X11 server first.\r\n  - Simple scaler rendering has altered the RENDER start line\r\n    state so that detection of a changed line triggers a block\r\n    of rendering without compare within a limited count before\r\n    checking again. This means a reduced CPU load with scalers\r\n    because it only detects frame changes every line before\r\n    changes detected, and then on average every 12th line\r\n    when running the scaler code. Hopefully this helps the\r\n    Raspberry Pi keep up with DOS gaming better.\r\n  - Simple scalers now offer compile-time (not run-time)\r\n    option to omit per-pixel compare in scaler and process\r\n    the entire scanline instead as a performance adjustment\r\n    for slower and embedded systems.\r\n  - Video debug menu added. First item is one that blanks the\r\n    display to test screen updating.\r\n  - Simple scalers (normal 2x-5x and SAI) revised to process\r\n    changes and scaler rendering in larger blocks for possible\r\n    performance improvement.\r\n  - Simple scalers fixed to properly compare all pixels to\r\n    detect changes properly, instead of only the first 4-8\r\n    pixels.\r\n  - EGA/VGA text rendering combined to reduce code copypasta\r\n    and reduce bugs.\r\n  - VGA 16-color planar modes now obey CRTC byte/word/dword\r\n    bits.\r\n0.82.12\r\n  - MinGW HX DOS builds fixed to accept mouse input properly\r\n    even beyond the 640x480 of the original SDL window\r\n    dimensions. HX DOS seems to use the original dimensions\r\n    of the window even if the window is maximized, thus the\r\n    mouse input issue.\r\n  - Configuration GUI fixed not to restore (unmaximize)\r\n    the window, it's unnecessary.\r\n  - New build scripts for Mac OS X, MinGW, and MinGW HX-DOS,\r\n    under build-scripts in the source tree, to help make\r\n    DOSBox-X releases more timely and consistent.\r\n  - MinGW HX DOS builds now use WS_POPUP style instead\r\n    of WS_OVERLAPPED to avoid window caption redraw\r\n    glitches when in Windows XP.\r\n  - MinGW HX DOS builds fixed to force the SDL window\r\n    maximized at all times. Mapper and Configuration GUI\r\n    interfaces fixed not to call on Windows to SW_RESTORE\r\n    the window, in order to keep it maximized.\r\n  - Steel Gun Nyan PIT/Timer hack revised so that polling\r\n    the timer does not cause an interrupt storm. This\r\n    fixes \"God of Thunder\" MS-DOS game where entering or\r\n    leaving a house causes the Adlib music to play\r\n    REALLY FAST during the transition effect.\r\n  - Dynrec core ported from DOSBox SVN (Daniel-Trevitz)\r\n  - Configuration GUI will pack settings closer together\r\n    if the window/screen size is below 800x600.\r\n  - Configuration GUI fixed to size dialog boxes as\r\n    large as needed to show all options, to allow tabbing\r\n    between options, to show a focus rectangle on the\r\n    items.\r\n  - Configuration GUI top level windows no longer show\r\n    inactive title bar whenever you access a menu.\r\n  - About dialog in configuration GUI updated to\r\n    reflect that this is DOSBox-X in 2018, not\r\n    DOSBox in 2014.\r\n  - Configuration GUI now works with touchscreens in\r\n    SDL2 builds.\r\n  - INT 33h fixed to regard cursor as hidden if hidden\r\n    for at least 100ms, which fixes host cursor flickering\r\n    when running the built-in FreeDOS EDIT.COM program.\r\n  - Mouse input and guest pointer integration limited\r\n    to send input only if within the display region or\r\n    within a 10% border around the display region.\r\n  - SDL2 tapping the SDL drawn menu bar (on a touch\r\n    screen) no longer triggers mouse click in the\r\n    guest application (bugfix).\r\n  - SDL2 Linux/X11 hack, added to compensate for bugs\r\n    in SDL2 v2.0.5 regarding Linux/X11 touchscreen\r\n    events, removed. SDL2 v2.0.9 fixed it.\r\n  - Linux/X11 SDL2 builds will now encourage the user\r\n    to update the SDL2 library installation if\r\n    SDL2 library v2.0.5 is installed.\r\n  - Fullscreen mode fixed in SDL2 builds.\r\n  - Fixed configuration GUI fade out/in effect after\r\n    exiting mapper GUI bug.\r\n  - Configuration GUI now available and working in\r\n    SDL2 builds as well as SDL1.\r\n  - SDL2 builds now have a working \"Fit aspect ratio\"\r\n    option.\r\n  - SDL1 fullscreen mode fixed to use either the desktop\r\n    size or the desired output size, and fallback to\r\n    non-fullscreen on failure, to fix a segfault that\r\n    would otherwise happen.\r\n  - CONFIG -set sdl showmenu= now changes menu visibility.\r\n  - CONFIG -set render scaler= fixed to apply changes\r\n    to scaler and force setting, and update menu items,\r\n    instead of ignoring it.\r\n  - CONFIG -set render aspect= now keeps menu synchronized\r\n    with setting.\r\n0.82.11\r\n  - SDL GUI fixed to make fade/sepia effect fit the\r\n    actual display rectangle instead of filling the\r\n    window.\r\n  - PC-98 BIOS keyboard handling now returns capitals\r\n    for A-Z if SHIFT xor CAPS LOCK is engaged.\r\n  - PC-98 BIOS keyboard handling now uses modifier bits\r\n    of keyboard bitmap to process scan codes, hackish\r\n    IBM PC/AT data area status handling in PC-98 mode\r\n    removed.\r\n  - PC-98 BIOS keyboard emulation now maps numeric keypad\r\n    to produce the correct keyboard input to the console\r\n    and games. This fixes games that rely on the numeric\r\n    keypad and the DOS console driver\r\n  - Command line parsing fixed to add any BAT, COM, and\r\n    EXE file references given at DOSBox-X's command line\r\n    to the autoexec.bat file run at startup.\r\n  - BOOT command bug fixed that made it impossible to\r\n    specify both disk images and the --debug and --force\r\n    options.\r\n  - Debug output fixed to make it easier to break into\r\n    the debugger even during a flood of debug output.\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to enable/disable the\r\n    PC-98 bus mouse interface\r\n  - PC-98 boot disks with 128 bytes/sector boot sectors\r\n    now load 4 sectors instead of 2. Seems to be\r\n    required by some games.\r\n  - INT 13h read/write functions fixed to refuse the\r\n    command if the floppy disk has a sector size too\r\n    large for the implementation (such as a PC-98\r\n    disk image mounted in IBM PC mode with 1024 bytes\r\n    per sector).\r\n  - INT 13h AH=2 (read sector) updated to return disk\r\n    change error on first read after disk change, to\r\n    match real BIOS behavior.\r\n  - Floppy emulation now tracks \"disk change\" signal.\r\n  - PIC event handling fixed, IRQ breakpoints now stop\r\n    at the beginning of the interrupt handler.\r\n  - MPU-401 MIDI default IRQ is now IRQ 6 in PC-98 mode,\r\n    to match factory default setting.\r\n  - MPU-401 MIDI IRQ masked by default in PC-98.\r\n  - PC-98 port BFDB implemented, which allows control\r\n    of the mouse interrupt rate.\r\n  - Eliminated mouse periodic interrupt hack, the mouse\r\n    interrupt on PC-98 is periodic when enabled.\r\n  - 256-byte/sector hard disk images fixed to ensure the\r\n    proper boot drive identifier is presented for MS-DOS\r\n    when booting a hard disk image.\r\n  - Added IMGMOUNT -o partidx=N option. N is an integer\r\n    value that indicates which partition to mount, counting\r\n    up from zero. This allows mounting disk images that\r\n    the FAT driver otherwise can't identify which partition\r\n    to mount.\r\n  - New general -o name=value option for IMGMOUNT, to pass\r\n    various options to the FAT driver.\r\n  - Update Metal Force mouse hack to become a more general\r\n    \"fire interrupt on Port C write\" with a dosbox.conf\r\n    option to enable. This fixes the requirement to move\r\n    the mouse constantly for \"Amaranth\" when enabled.\r\n  - Add to cascade interrupt hacks by offering an option\r\n    to ignore the \"in service\" bit of the PIC for the\r\n    cascade interrupt, while still tracking it for\r\n    the DOS game or interrupt. Handy for PC-98 games\r\n    that check the cascade \"in service\" bit before\r\n    acting on the interrupt (IRQ 8-15).\r\n  - DOS kernel fixed to limit it's private area and\r\n    UMB region to avoid overlapping the PC-98 SOUND\r\n    BIOS.\r\n  - PC-98 SOUND BIOS dummy stub added for games that\r\n    call into it.\r\n  - Emulator hanging problem fixed when inputs are\r\n    processed while running at a very low cycle count.\r\n  - Added PC-98 LIO BIOS list and stub for games that\r\n    require it.\r\n  - Timer and PIC updated to emulate Mode 3 Square Wave\r\n    output through the IRR register. Needed for Steel\r\n    Gun Nyan.\r\n  - PC-98 INT 18h fixed to reenable and process any\r\n    keyboard data waiting when the DOS game or application\r\n    calls INT 18h to read keyboard input. This fixes\r\n    keyboard problems with Quarth.\r\n  - PC-98 FDC BIOS emulation no longer reprograms the\r\n    timer interrupt, but uses an alternate hack to\r\n    avoid divide by zero fault with Ys II.\r\n  - PC-98 GDC command to read back cursor position\r\n    added.\r\n  - PC-98 DOS CON device emulation now maintains ANSI\r\n    attribute byte at 60:11D as documented.\r\n  - BOOT now hides hardware cursor when booting a guest\r\n    OS in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - INT 1Dh vector now points at segment FD80 to satisfy\r\n    some games that autodetect PC-98 vs other platforms.\r\n  - INT 18h AH=42 implement display \"bank\" bit for games\r\n    that need it.\r\n  - PC-98 text scroll region implemented (I/O ports\r\n    76h-7Ah even).\r\n  - PC-98 CRTC mode set regarding 20/25-line mode fixed\r\n    to update line height, text vertical position/height,\r\n    and cursor shape.\r\n  - PC-98 emulation of text height/vertical position\r\n    registers 70h-74h even added.\r\n  - PC-98 text hardware cursor fixed to cover both halves\r\n    of doublewide characters if cursor positioned on left\r\n    half, to match real hardware.\r\n  - Fixed music/interrupt slowdown whenever I/O and INT 10h\r\n    BIOS emulation is involved.\r\n  - PC-98 minimal (non-functional at this time) printer\r\n    port emulation added, as well as system configuration\r\n    port.\r\n  - PC-98 CG memory region fixed to match real hardware\r\n    behavior, responding to A4000-A4FFF.\r\n  - FAT filesystem driver now supports 2048 bytes per\r\n    sector filesystems.\r\n  - FAT filesystem driver logical/physical sector matching\r\n    fixed to improve flexibility.\r\n  - Fixed crash that occurs if you maximize the window\r\n    and then adjust scalers to produce output that is\r\n    larger than the maximized window.\r\n  - INT 33h emulation now offers hiding the host cursor\r\n    if the guest has provided an interrupt subroutine\r\n    for the mouse driver to call, since it usually means\r\n    the DOS game wishes to draw the cursor itself.\r\n  - INT 33h emulation now offers hiding the host cursor\r\n    if the guest is polling the cursor position, to\r\n    better support guest/host integration with DOS games\r\n    that draw their own cursor.\r\n  - AUX and PS/2 emulation no longer allowed if machine\r\n    type is PCjr.\r\n  - PS/2 mouse emulation fixed to disable itself if the\r\n    slave PIC needed for IRQ 12 is not present.\r\n  - INT 33h pointer integration improved to support some\r\n    additional DOS games, and to handle DeluxePaint II\r\n    enhanced.\r\n  - IMGMOUNT now supports NFD disk images.\r\n  - DOSBox Integration Device now available for PC-98.\r\n  - Added support for T98Next NHD hard disk images.\r\n  - Added support for T98Next NFD R1 disk images.\r\n  - Fixed crash with VGA BIOS allocation if video memory\r\n    allows the full modelist to overflow the available\r\n    ROM space.\r\n  - SDL2 mapper redraw issue resolved.\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to determine whether INT 10h\r\n    VESA BIOS emulation points at the modelist in ROM or\r\n    copies the modelist into the DOS application's info\r\n    structure when asked.\r\n0.82.10\r\n  - PC-98 INT 1Bh floppy emulation now fakes success for\r\n    calls to format track.\r\n  - Initial keyboard pause fixed\r\n  - PC-98 INT 1Bh floppy disk BIOS call now resets timer\r\n    interval per call. This fixes Ys II after disk swap.\r\n  - BIOS fixed to put normal \"unhandled INT call\" handler\r\n    for INT 0-7 even in PC-98 mode to avoid confusion\r\n    between game crashes and unknown INT calls.\r\n  - VFD image support fixed to properly handle disk images\r\n    where a sector is marked with fill byte 0xFF and the\r\n    data field is 0xFFFFFFFF, which means the sector contents\r\n    are all 0xFF.\r\n  - DOSBox-X now supports T98 NFD disk images (R0).\r\n  - BIOS data area now properly reports a high-resolution\r\n    CRT display.\r\n  - INT DCh AH=1 CL=10h added, which is apparently a print\r\n    string function.\r\n  - BIOS data area now reports 188+ user-definable CG slots,\r\n    which makes GAJET happy.\r\n  - FDI image support fixed to read the header instead of\r\n    treating it as a plain disk image with 4096 of junk.\r\n  - PC-98 character generator is now accessible through both\r\n    I/O ports A1h-A9h and through memory-mapped I/O range\r\n    A4000-A401F. This fixes missing text in Eve Burst Error.\r\n  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation will no longer log GUS reset\r\n    writes in cases where the same value is being written\r\n    repeatedly, to reduce log clutter. Some demoscene\r\n    productions have music routines that trigger GUS reset\r\n    repeatedly without changing the register.\r\n  - Added \"gus master volume\" setting to deal with games or\r\n    demoscene productions where the music is too loud and clipping.\r\n  - Added \"Pause with interrupts\". When enabled, the CPU is directed\r\n    into a CALLBACK_Idle() loop to halt the game's main\r\n    logic while allowing interrupts to run. This is useful\r\n    for recording the game or demo's music because most DOS\r\n    games/demos run the music and sound effects from interrupt\r\n    handlers instead of the main loop.\r\n  - Audio/video capture fixed to render audio even if muted,\r\n    instead of rendering garbage to the capture file when\r\n    audio is muted.\r\n  - Experimental Emscripten + Node target (not reliable yet).\r\n  - Added option to control how unhandled IRQs are dealt with.\r\n    One option, mask_isr, is derived from em-dosbox.\r\n  - Code added to read the screen dimensions in Linux/X11,\r\n    either through XRandR or through the base X11 API.\r\n  - Code added to read and store the dimensions, size, and\r\n    DPI (Dots per Inch) of the screen.\r\n  - Fixed bug that enabled IBM style APM BIOS in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - For PC-98 mode, PIC emulation by default (but controllable\r\n    through dosbox.conf) now initializes the PIC at startup to\r\n    return the ISR (interrupt in-service) register instead of\r\n    the IRR (interrupt request) register. This fixes FM\r\n    music problems with Blackbird by Vivian caused by a\r\n    programming mistake in the FM interrupt handler.\r\n  - PIC emulation now accepts a dosbox.conf option not to mark\r\n    the cascade interrupt as in service, for troublesome games.\r\n  - VESA BIOS emulation now supports a packed 16-color (4bpp)\r\n    mode as seen on a Toshiba Libretto (Chips & Tech) system.\r\n    The packed format is different than the normal planar 16-color\r\n    SVGA modes seen on most systems.\r\n  - INT 33h no longer reports relative mouse motion unless the\r\n    user captures the cursor.\r\n  - Fixed EGA 16-color display modes (M_EGA) to honor CGA and\r\n    Hercules compatible mapping modes (bits 0 and 1 of the\r\n    CRTC mode control) and limit memory display to 8KB or 16KB\r\n    accordingly. This fixes the mode select screen in the game\r\n    \"Prehistorik 2\".\r\n  - Removed Sound Blaster goldplay mode + sample accurate mode\r\n    warning, goldplay mode no longer has issues with sample\r\n    accurate mode.\r\n  - Mixer \"sample accurate\" mode fixed to work again.\r\n  - Windows SDL1 builds fixed to work around Windows SDK-level API\r\n    limitation that normally prevents Win32 applications from\r\n    fully receiving WM_KEYDOWN events for the left/right shift\r\n    keys independently. Left and right shift keys are now fully\r\n    usable on Windows builds (i.e. for use with pinball games).\r\n  - INSTALL.MD guide and test files (Aybe)\r\n  - CONFIG -get now populates %CONFIG% environment variable with\r\n    configuration setting (follow DOSBox SVN behavior)\r\n0.82.9\r\n  - \"Always on top\" mode is now available for Mac OS X builds.\r\n  - PS/2 mouse emulation fixed not to send relative mouse motion\r\n    unless mouse cursor is captured.\r\n  - Shell no longer provides MEM.COM if machine=pc98 or cputype=8086.\r\n    MEM.COM is not compatible with either case.\r\n  - INT 10h emulation will now set the S3 LFB enable bit for VESA\r\n    SVGA modes, unless machine=vesa_nolfb was specified.\r\n  - VGA emulation revised to report possible known problems with\r\n    Windows 3.1 with regard to LFB base address or memalias setting.\r\n  - VGA emulation fixed to emit warning if memalias=24, for S3 LFB,\r\n    if machine=svga_s3, to inform the user that the configuration is\r\n    known to cause the Windows 3.x driver to crash.\r\n  - VGA emulation will no longer report S3 linear framebuffer address\r\n    unless machine=svga_s3. The LFB address doesn't matter for anything\r\n    other than SVGA S3 emulation.\r\n  - S3 emulation will now automatically disable PCI VGA emulation if\r\n    constraints prevent DOSBox-X from setting a linear framebuffer\r\n    address aligned to 32MB (as required for PCI emulation).\r\n  - VGA emulation fixed to pick a more appropriate linear framebuffer\r\n    (S3) address if memalias is set to a value below 32.\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option \"pci vga\" to control whether the VGA\r\n    emulation appears as a PCI or ISA device.\r\n  - ROM BIOS now forces reported RAM down to make room for BIOS\r\n    alias at top of memory instead of throwing an E_Exit error.\r\n  - Fixed Hercules emulation (and MDA) so that the Hercules palette\r\n    is always enforced. This fixes a bug where switching to HGC\r\n    graphics mode resulted in monochrome blue/black graphics instead\r\n    of the intended white/green/amber color expected.\r\n  - Added MDA emulation (machine=mda). It functions like\r\n    machine=hercules minus the graphics mode and Hercules-specific\r\n    extensions to the base MDA card.\r\n  - DOSBox shell no longer accepts dosbox.conf settings as commands\r\n    by default, unless enabled in dosbox.conf. Typing \"cycles\" will\r\n    no longer show cycle count. The dosbox.conf setting allows the\r\n    user to enable it again i.e. for compatibility with DOSBox SVN.\r\n    This is to prevent dosbox.conf settings from polluting the\r\n    available commands at the shell and conflicting with shell and\r\n    executable names.\r\n  - EGA emulation fixed to obey Color Plane Enable register in\r\n    16-color planar modes.\r\n  - Fixed BIOS model byte to report PS/2 model 30 correctly when\r\n    machine=mcga, to allow certain DOS games to detect MCGA that way.\r\n  - CGA mode/color select registers are readable on MCGA, fix 3D8-3D9h\r\n    to reflect that.\r\n  - INT 10h fixed to properly allow/deny AH=10h, AH=11h, and AH=12h calls\r\n    according to machine= type instead of mistakes that blocked too many\r\n    calls.\r\n  - CGA composite mode should not be available when machine=mcga.\r\n  - Fixed INT 10h to report MCGA color display if machine=mcga.\r\n  - MCGA (IBM PS/2 Multi-Color Graphics Adapter) emulation added.\r\n  - bitop C++11 self-test disabled for Microsoft Visual Studio builds.\r\n    Microsoft's compiler can't handle them for some reason.\r\n  - Added DOSLIB DSXMENU.EXE to the built-in executable list.\r\n    DSXMENU.EXE allows DOS CONFIG.SYS style menus to be set up to\r\n    run commands based on menu selection.\r\n  - PC-98 ANSI emulation fixed to use the number of rows on the screen,\r\n    not cursor position, to range-clip ANSI cursor positioning.\r\n  - Added code to have DX-CAPTURE wait 3 seconds (or until ENTER/SPACE\r\n    is pressed) after the program exits, before stopping capture.\r\n  - DOSBox-X menus now allow runtime selection of capture format\r\n    (AVI+ZMBV or MPEG-TS H.264). Changing while capturing will stop/start\r\n    capture correctly.\r\n  - Added switches to DX-CAPTURE to allow specifying audio, multitrack audio,\r\n    and video as well.\r\n  - DX-CAPTURE shell command added. The command to run is specified\r\n    after DX-CAPTURE and DX-CAPTURE will start video capture, run the\r\n    program, then stop capture when the program exits.\r\n  - VGA/SVGA emulation fixed to enforce 256KB (64KB planar) wraparound\r\n    when emulating stock VGA modes (not SVGA/VESA BIOS). Some\r\n    demoscene productions rely on the 256KB wraparound when showing\r\n    scrolling credits.\r\n  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation now uses I/O callout system, with\r\n    I/O port handling to emulate ISA bus 10-bit decoding (but with\r\n    consideration of GUS MAX 7xx registers) so that GUS I/O ports\r\n    are visible every 1000h I/O ports. A demoscene production was\r\n    found that relies on an alias of GUS ports at 5xxxh rather than\r\n    using the I/O ports directly.\r\n  - Mouse emulation no longer sends motion to serial and PC-98 mouse\r\n    emulation unless mouse cursor has been captured.\r\n  - Mouse emulation fixed to set sensitivity and mickey count even if\r\n    int33=false on mouse emulation reset.\r\n  - Debugger fixed to paginate commands with a lot of output, including\r\n    HELP, PIC, and various commands to dump interrupts and GDT/IDT tables.\r\n  - CPU core no longer triggers Double Fault if Divide Overflow\r\n    occurs within Divide Overflow. This is needed for bizarre anti-debugger\r\n    obfuscated code seen in a demoscene production, where the program\r\n    wraps the demo in a mini-filesystem emulated by trapping INT 21h.\r\n  - cputype= dosbox.conf setting fixed to allow selecting between\r\n    new 486 emulation (cputype=486) and old 486 emulation (cputype=486old).\r\n    The \"old\" 486 core emulates older 486 CPUs that differ significantly\r\n    from the newer 486 CPUs that inherited features from the Pentium.\r\n  - IRQ hack setting for GUS and Sound Blaster is now a list so that\r\n    multiple hacks can be specified, but in a way that is backwards\r\n    compatible with existing dosbox.conf files.\r\n  - IRQ hack option for Gravis Ultrasound added.\r\n  - INT 20h emulation fixed to work with demoscene productions that\r\n    call INT 20h in a way that the interrupt frame wraps around the\r\n    64KB limit of the stack.\r\n  - XMS emulation now has a dosbox.conf setting to control the number\r\n    of XMS handles available.\r\n  - Added INT 33h option not to round mouse cursor coordinates to text\r\n    cell boundaries in text mode. Some demoscene productions were found\r\n    that detects mouse movement, but reads initial position from text mode\r\n    before switching to graphics.\r\n  - Removed IRQ0 error measurement hack, to match DOSBox SVN. This fixes\r\n    timing problems with some demoscene productions. The error measurement\r\n    hack was apparently added for Microsoft Flight simulator, but has not\r\n    been needed since and has been causing timing issues since.\r\n  - Fixed INT 10h VGA save state function to program the Attribute Controller\r\n    properly so that the screen is not left blank after the call.\r\n  - 8042 keyboard emulation now initializes port 60h to 0xAA on hardware\r\n    reset and initialization. Some DOS games and demoscene productions\r\n    need something with bit 7 set in the register at startup in order not\r\n    to act as if a key was immediately pressed.\r\n  - Add printer emulation from Daum's branch of DOSBox, add FreeType 2.9.1\r\n    to go with it (Alex/AT)\r\n  - Add keyboard type setting, for use in future development.\r\n  - PCjr emulation fixed to emulate PC/XT style NMI mask at port A0h\r\n    rather than emulate the secondary PIC.\r\n  - Code of Conduct revised to make it clear that forks/derivatives CAN\r\n    have their own Code of Conduct but that it only applies to that fork\r\n    or derivative version. No forking DOSBox-X, changing the code of\r\n    conduct, and enforcing it on anyone outside your fork.\r\n  - CPU normal core fixed to clear ZF flag after MUL when cputype=8086,\r\n    which fixes problems with MSD.EXE mis-detecting the CPU as a NEC V20.\r\n  - Fixed PCjr emulation not to allow UMB (upper memory blocks) since\r\n    that seems to cause stability issues with emulation. Also, PCjr\r\n    does not have UMB as far as I know.\r\n  - Fixed PCjr not to re-read port 60h from IRQ1 handler.\r\n  - Fixed PCjr not to emulate INT 15h keyboard hook.\r\n  - PCjr keyboard emulation fixed to trigger NMI and reflect to IRQ1\r\n    the way it actually works on IBM PCjr systems, which also fixes\r\n    keyboard control issues with the PCjr version of \"Pitfall\".\r\n  - configure.ac now provides an option for compiler optimization (Yksoft1)\r\n  - Code of Conduct, initial version, added to source tree\r\n  - PC-98 palette save/load state\r\n  - CPU, memory, VGA palette and attribute controller save/load state\r\n  - DOS SHELL now implements INT 0x2E to allow DOS programs to invoke\r\n    shell commands through COMMAND.COM (borrowed from DOSBox SVN).\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to control the physical memory address of the\r\n    S3 SVGA linear framebuffer.\r\n  - Save/load state system added, currently very minimal and experimental.\r\n  - Appveyor XML added to source tree (Allofich)\r\n  - Fixed *most* SDL2 refresh problems.\r\n  - Sound Blaster Pro mixer volume fixed to return reserved bits SET rather\r\n    than CLEAR. Some demoscene productions detect Sound Blaster Pro by whether\r\n    these bits remain set when written. This fix allows them to detect Sound\r\n    Blaster Pro as Sound Blaster Pro.\r\n  - VGA emulation fixed not to add 2 scanlines twice, which fixes VGA vertical\r\n    timing and scanline count and fixes the scroller in \"Inconexia\".\r\n  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation now prints a warning if the game/demo attempts\r\n    a DMA transfer while leaving the DMA channel masked.\r\n  - Fixed Gravis Ultrasound emulation to mask DRAM peek/poke I/O to the 1MB\r\n    offered by the card, which fixes GUS problems with a demoscene production\r\n    that has random values in DRAM address bits 23-20.\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option that, if set, lets Gravis Ultrasound emulation\r\n    start a DMA transfer if the game/demo is polling the DMA control register\r\n    when DMA is unmasked and DMA terminal count has not occurred, which helps\r\n    some demoscene productions.\r\n  - Added \"PIC unmask IRQ\" option for Gravis Ultrasound emulation.\r\n  - Gravis Ultrasound emulation now has a dosbox.conf setting to initialize\r\n    the hardware at startup as if ULTRINIT had been run.\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option for VESA BIOS emulation that, if set, instructs\r\n    non-LFB modes to report 64KB windows but map 128KB from the start of\r\n    the window, which helps (but does not fully solve) some Demoscene\r\n    productions with redraw problems handling non-LFB as if LFB.\r\n  - Fixed ET4000 emulation to support the hretrace \"wobble\" needed for\r\n    \"Copper\"\r\n  - VGA DAC/attribute controller behavior updated to reflect actual behavior\r\n    as seen on an IBM PS/2 VGA model, as well as almost any SVGA clone.\r\n  - VGA DAC behavior unique to Tseng ET4000 implemented when machine=svga_et4000.\r\n    256-color mode on the ET4000 seems to map the low 4 bits through the\r\n    attribute controller and, if enabled, the upper 4 bits through the\r\n    color select register. Note this behavior is REQUIRED for the\r\n    \"copper\" demo to display properly.\r\n  - VGA palette, DAC, and attribute controller emulation updated to\r\n    reflect actual VGA behavior, including the way that 256-color mode\r\n    is mapped through the attribute controller.\r\n  - Sierra highcolor DAC can now be enabled for any VGA/SVGA emulation\r\n  - Cleanup and reorganization of scaler, aspect ratio handling (Alex/AT)\r\n  - MinGW config.h builds fixed to enable Direct3D (Alex/AT)\r\n  - Build fixes for SDL1 and Linux and extended functions (JP Cimalando)\r\n  - Fixed ALSA MIDI mistake preventing the creation of subscription\r\n    ports (JP Cimalando)\r\n  - Previous release broke SVGA 16-color planar modes by masking video\r\n    memory to 64KB planar boundaries at all times, fixed code to do so\r\n    only for non-VESA modes. 1024x768 16-color mode works again.\r\n  - Fixed user-defined VESA BIOS modes to validate the required video\r\n    memory against the available memory on the emulated SVGA hardware.\r\n  - VESA BIOS modelist generation moved into its own function. Modelist\r\n    is regenerated upon editing/deletion of modes.\r\n  - VESA BIOS modes added as suggested by hail-to-the-ryzen\r\n  - VESA BIOS emulation now allows scriptable editing, deletion, and\r\n    mode renaming of VESA BIOS modes for use with picky DOS games and\r\n    demoscene productions that assume mode numbers.\r\n  - Added VESA BIOS mode 0x136 as an alias for 320x200x16bpp mode\r\n  - Enhancements to GFX_CaptureMouse and CaptureMouseNotify added\r\n  - Fixed scaler change detection to use sizeof(int) properly than assume\r\n    a certain byte count\r\n  - Fixed undefined sse2_available reference issue in certain builds\r\n0.82.8\r\n  - New xBRZ scaler (with bilinear mode) (Alexat)\r\n  - Fixed aspect ratio correction to use the ratio given by VGA emulation\r\n    instead of assuming 4:3\r\n  - output=surface and xBRZ now permit filling the window just like\r\n    output=opengl and output=direct3d\r\n  - Added critical section around Windows SDL 1.x resize code to solve\r\n    the remaining 0.5% probability that resizing the window causes move\r\n    and resize to stop working in Windows 10.\r\n  - INT 10h AH=10h now ignores AL=3 in PCjr mode.\r\n  - Fixed keyboard handler bug in PCjr mode that caused some CPU\r\n    register corruption and general crashiness in games.\r\n  - Improved shell: (Aybe, Joncampbell123)\r\n    - Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right permits word-navigation.\r\n    - Added emulation of 'Ins' key behavior.\r\n  - Num Lock, Caps Lock, Scroll Lock are now synchronized at startup\r\n    and when DOSBox-X window gains focus again (Windows). (Aybe)\r\n  - Added visual feedback to Hat/D-pad buttons in mapper. (Aybe)\r\n  - Added documentation for 'dir' command sorting switches. (Aybe)\r\n  - Menu 'Show console' is now checked with '-console' (SDL1). (Aybe)\r\n  - Improved joystick support (see README.joystick): (Aybe)\r\n    - Added deadzone and response for joystick axes.\r\n    - Axes can be remapped for devices with questionable layout.\r\n    - User-settable deadzones for joystick bindings in mapper,\r\n      mappings like WSAD keys to axes is less frustrating.\r\n  - Improved mouse integration (Aybe):\r\n    - Now by default DOSBox-X does not emulate mouse movement when the mouse\r\n      is not locked. This gives a consistent experience when compared to host OS.\r\n      For the old behavior, use [sdl] mouse_emulation=always.\r\n    - Added visual or auditive feedback about auto-lock state (Windows).\r\n      This feature can be switched off, use [sdl] autolock_feedback=none.\r\n  - Added CAPMOUSE program for capturing/releasing mouse from command line. (Aybe)\r\n    \r\n0.82.7\r\n  - Mac OS X builds now honor showmenu=false by leaving the\r\n    stock SDL menu in place at startup.\r\n  - Default minimum MCB free/base is now 0x100, to sidestep\r\n    unknown unstable DOS application behavior when DOS\r\n    applications are loaded at around segment 0x800.\r\n    This also puts DOSBox-X at parity with the base memory\r\n    behavior of DOSBox SVN.\r\n  - Add dosbox.conf option to set Sound BIOS enable\r\n    bit in non-volatile RAM (PC-98) that tells older\r\n    PC-98 games the FM card is present (Yksoft)\r\n  - BOOT updated to boot D88 except for 2D format which\r\n    is generally used by PC-88 disk images.\r\n  - Added D88 disk image support\r\n  - CMake files added (Aybe)\r\n  - PIC timing updated to use \"double\" float type for\r\n    more precision, but as a typedef for future support\r\n    as a compile time option.\r\n  - Removed geometry checks from INT 1Bh FDC functions,\r\n    to allow non-uniform disks to work.\r\n  - MinGW builds now allowed to use Direct3D.\r\n  - Direct3D output fixed to use the same texture\r\n    coordinate, window fitting, and positioning\r\n    logic as OpenGL.\r\n  - Update zlib and libpng libraries in-tree.\r\n  - Fixed VFD disk image support to correctly signal\r\n    failure to detect geometry, to avoid divide by\r\n    zero crash with FAT driver.\r\n  - showmenu= now taken into consideration whether to\r\n    show the menu bar at startup\r\n  - Fixed get_item() E_Exit crash if menus asked to\r\n    show from dosbox.conf\r\n  - SDL drawn menus fixed to integrate with Direct3D\r\n    output on Windows.\r\n  - PC-98 mode can now boot floppy disk images where the\r\n    boot sector is 128 or 256 bytes/sector despite\r\n    track 1 and higher having 1024 bytes/sector.\r\n  - General codebase cleanup, compiler warning cleanup.\r\n  - Enable XInput support on Windows (Aybe)\r\n  - Fixed SDL drawn menus to use std::vector properly,\r\n    not to hold onto iterators while resizing the vector\r\n    and popping things off the top.\r\n  - PC-98 INT 1Bh \"read id\" floppy disk call fixed to\r\n    cycle through sector numbers. Some bootable PC-98\r\n    games use \"MEGDOS\" which polls this BIOS call before\r\n    attempting to read the disk. If the sector numbers\r\n    never cycle, \"MEGDOS\" will not attempt to read the\r\n    disk.\r\n  - Fixed bug that prevented some menu options (such as\r\n    \"aspect ratio\") from working if still in the BIOS or\r\n    booted into a guest OS.\r\n  - PC-98 mode fixed to ignore \"mainline compatible mapping\".\r\n    That mapping mode refers to DOSBox SVN which never\r\n    supported PC-98 mode anyway.\r\n  - Fix PC-98 INT 1Bh \"test read\" call, which then allows\r\n    \"cherry bomb\" to run.\r\n  - Remove geometry checks in PC-98 INT 1Bh BIOS call, so\r\n    that FDD images with odd sector sizes can work.\r\n  - ROM BIOS now automatically occupies E8000-FFFFF instead\r\n    of F0000-FFFFF when in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - Most 128 byte/sector FDD images appear to jump to\r\n    E800:0002. I'm guessing that's ROM BASIC, so add a\r\n    callback at that location to catch these boot disks\r\n    and show a message instead of allowing the boot\r\n    sector to jump to nothing and crash.\r\n  - PC-98 BOOT fixed to check for and support booting from\r\n    FDD images where track 0 contains 128 byte/sector\r\n    boot sectors.\r\n  - PC-98 INT 1Bh support fixed to support reading/writing\r\n    sector sizes other than the one sector size reported\r\n    by the image. It is now possible to read the other\r\n    sector sizes from an FDD/VFD image.\r\n  - Fixed somewhat serious bug that, when compiled against\r\n    Microsoft C++, causes the AVI writer to use the 32-bit\r\n    lseek() function instead of the 64-bit lseek64() function.\r\n    Prior to this fix, AVI captures would begin to corrupt\r\n    themselves after growing past 2GB in size.\r\n  - Cleanup code, fix compiler warnings, typecast problems,\r\n    C/C++ conformance problems as reported by GCC 4.8,\r\n    GCC 7.3.0 (MinGW), Visual Studio 2017, and Clang/LLVM\r\n    on Mac OS X.\r\n  - FM Towns machine type stub, for anyone interested in\r\n    forking DOSBox-X to implement FM Towns emulation.\r\n  - Code cleanup, refactor, according to compiler warnings.\r\n  - SDL drawn menus fixed to copy Direct3D backbuffer to\r\n    the SDL surface when popup occurs. This allows the\r\n    menus to overlap the Direct3D display correctly.\r\n  - Fixed Direct3D output so that when composing the next\r\n    frame in the backbuffer, it also copies the SDL drawn\r\n    menu from the SDL surface in order to keep it on\r\n    screen.\r\n  - Direct3D output updated to follow SDL clip rectangle\r\n    struct, in the same exact manner as the OpenGL output.\r\n    This also permits the Direct3D output to correctly size\r\n    itself and leave space at the top for the SDL drawn\r\n    menus.\r\n  - Fixed dynamic core entry point to push/pop EBP because\r\n    debug builds need the compiler to track the stack frame.\r\n  - Updated in-tree zlib and libpng libraries to the latest\r\n    provided by both projects.\r\n  - Fixed VFD (FDD) disk image support to signal to FAT driver\r\n    properly an error if it could not determine a geometry.\r\n  - Fixed code breakage with SDL2 that prevented compilation\r\n    with Munt (MT32) emulation enabled. SDL2 builds now allow\r\n    MT32 emulation.\r\n  - Mac OS X builds now compile against the in-tree zlib and\r\n    libpng libraries for consistency.\r\n  - MinGW builds now compile against the MinGW provided zlib\r\n    and the in-tree libpng library for consistency.\r\n  - Enabled MinGW builds to use Direct3D and Direct3D shaders.\r\n  - Added code to auto-detect the VirtualBox display driver\r\n    in Windows build, because OpenGL output doesn't work\r\n    in Windows XP under VirtualBox. The change will switch\r\n    the default output to \"surface\" if VirtualBox is detected,\r\n    else will retain the \"opengl\" default. This change applies\r\n    only to MinGW builds and not HX DOS or main VS2017 builds.\r\n  - Added PC-98 INT DCh emulation for function call that\r\n    writes a char to the screen, allowing Eve Burst Error\r\n    to clear the function row\r\n  - Added command line option to allow skipping the 1-second\r\n    wait in the BIOS startup screen.\r\n  - SDL2 builds now support use of the SDL drawn menu with\r\n    a touchscreen device.\r\n  - Fixed up SDL2 support code to compile correctly on\r\n    Mac OS X.\r\n  - Fixed up SDL2 compilation to automatically use the\r\n    SDL2 library on the system, or if that is not available,\r\n    use the SDL2 library in-tree. There are no plans to make\r\n    modifications to the in-tree SDL2 code.\r\n  - Added code to read and discard OpenGL error code before\r\n    creating font texture, to avoid false failure handling.\r\n    This fixes font rendering on Windows MinGW builds when\r\n    output=opengl.\r\n  - OpenGL SDL drawn menus fixed to ensure the menu contents\r\n    have been redrawn at least twice. One for each OpenGL\r\n    buffer because DOSBox-X uses the double-buffered mode.\r\n  - SDL drawn menus implemented for output=opengl. The menu\r\n    bar in Linux builds is now available in OpenGL mode.\r\n  - SDL drawn menus fixed to redraw only when state changes,\r\n    and to clean up menu drawing code.\r\n  - US keyboards can now enter the \"Ro\" key in PC-98 mode.\r\n    Default binding is set up to map the Windows Menu key\r\n    as Ro in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - VGA option change code fixed to trigger scaler redraw\r\n    correctly. Changing video modes or changing between\r\n    8/9-pixel VGA text no longer leaves artifacts on the\r\n    screen.\r\n  - Added code to force redrawing additional frames when\r\n    output=opengl, in order to correct a bug with Linux/X11\r\n    and MesaGL where the first OpenGL buffer swap after\r\n    SDL_SetVideoMode() is misplaced when the window size\r\n    changes.\r\n  - Renderer SSE line comparison fixed to use correct sizeof()\r\n    of the integer type during compare.\r\n  - Renderer fixed not to use SSE and non-SSE line comparison\r\n    at the same time, if SSE was enabled at compile time.\r\n  - Fixed in-tree SDL 1.x library to allow DOSBox-X to disable\r\n    auto-refresh of the window in Linux/X11 after SDL_SetVideoMode\r\n    to prevent visible flickering when resizing the window.\r\n  - Conditional support for Direct3D (9) output enabled for\r\n    MinGW builds, if the MinGW headers are available (yksoft1).\r\n    Option is disabled by default.\r\n  - Configuration GUI dialog box widened to accommodate buttons\r\n    that were previously cut off on the right.\r\n  - Replace E_Exit() with LOG_MSG() for key codes from the mapper\r\n    that a keyboard scan code generator does not recognize. This\r\n    fixes E_Exit() crashes if typing certain keys on a Japanese\r\n    keyboard with no equivalent in IBM PC/AT mode.\r\n  - Added code to double the size of the menu and menu items if\r\n    the window is 1280x800 or larger, for users with high\r\n    definition laptop displays and screens.\r\n  - Enforce minimum window size of 640x400 if the menu bar is\r\n    visible and DOSBox-X is drawing them, to make sure the menus\r\n    are accessible on screen.\r\n  - Removed auto-scalar-size code when output=surface that was\r\n    causing problems when resizing the window.\r\n  - Do not show \"screenshot\" menu item if screenshot support not\r\n    available at compile time.\r\n  - Remove \"always on top\" for anything but Windows at this time.\r\n  - Disable \"Show debugger\" option on Linux and Mac OS X if no\r\n    console attached to STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR.\r\n  - Disable \"Show console\" option on Linux and Mac OS X since\r\n    the console is not under our control.\r\n  - Windows \"Always on top\" fixed to remember selection and\r\n    enforce it between SDL_SetVideoMode and fullscreen entry/exit.\r\n  - Windows builds fixed NOT to change window Z-order on the\r\n    screen when updating the window on SDL_SetVideoMode.\r\n  - HX DOS builds fixed to keep window maximized at all times\r\n    to fill the otherwise unused space on the screen since\r\n    HXGUI only supports one window.\r\n  - Menu framework support for any other platform (including\r\n    Linux) added. The menus are drawn by DOSBox-X itself\r\n    using the 8x16 VGA font. This also gives SDL 2.x builds\r\n    a working menu. These menus are used if no other platform\r\n    specific menus are available. These menus are NOT AVAILABLE\r\n    at this time if output=opengl.\r\n  - Cycle count edit dialog box fixed to immediately place\r\n    keyboard focus in the text field, and to process\r\n    ENTER and ESCAPE keyboard input as OK and CANCEL\r\n    button input. You can type a new cycles count without\r\n    having to click on the text field first.\r\n  - Menu framework and mapper fixed so that menus always\r\n    reflect the mapper binding in the menu.\r\n  - Windows SDL 1.x fixed async hack to properly destroy\r\n    and shut down the parent window again.\r\n  - Fixed output=opengl crash on Mac OS X.\r\n  - Menu framework support for Mac OS X NSMenu objects added.\r\n    This gives DOSBox-X the same useful menu on Mac OS X\r\n    instead of the useless default menu SDL 1.x offers.\r\n  - Menu framework support for Windows win32 menu resources\r\n    added. The Windows menu is now generated at runtime,\r\n    the static IDR_MENU resource is no longer used.\r\n  - New platform independent menu framework added. Menus\r\n    that were once Windows-only are now available on\r\n    any other platform including Linux and Mac OS X.\r\n  - In-tree SDL 1.x library fixed to #define a special\r\n    variable that the code now requires to compile\r\n    SDL 1.x builds. The option to use your host SDL 2.x\r\n    library is left open.\r\n  - C++11 is now mandatory to compile DOSBox-X\r\n0.82.6\r\n  - Resizing the window in SDL 1.x Windows builds\r\n    fixed to work correctly in the latest build\r\n    (1803) of Windows 10. Prior to this fix, resizing\r\n    the window on that build would quickly hit a deadlock\r\n    that prevented the user from moving or resizing the\r\n    window again after that point.\r\n  - PC-98 dosbox.conf option added to select between\r\n    accurate key/shift mapping, vs an alternate mapping\r\n    appropriate for US keyboards (Yksoft1)\r\n  - SDL 1.x for Linux/X11 modified to differentiate\r\n    Ro and Yen keys despite X11 xkbmap apparently\r\n    mapping both to the backslash. The keymap is\r\n    queried to detect the scancodes at startup\r\n    in order to return the correct SDLK constant.\r\n  - SDL 1.x and DOSBox-X mapper code updated to\r\n    correctly map Ro, Yen, @ ^ ; : keys on a JP\r\n    keyboard in Windows and Linux.\r\n  - PC-98 keyboard BIOS handling updated to generate\r\n    ASCII codes according to PC-98 layout, instead\r\n    of by US keyboard layout.\r\n  - Mapper updated to support @ (at sign) key,\r\n    ^ (caret) key, and a few other keys that\r\n    exist on JP keyboards.\r\n  - \"Hold\" modifier for mapper bindings fixed.\r\n    It is now possible to tap the key again to\r\n    release the hold.\r\n  - VHD differencing disk support added (Shane32)\r\n  - INT 18h AH=0Ah updated to support 20-line\r\n    text mode. Some games use the 20-line text\r\n    mode to space the text out vertically.\r\n    Such games will display correctly now.\r\n  - INT 18h now maintains text layer state\r\n    in BIOS data area byte 0x53C, just as\r\n    the actual BIOS does.\r\n  - Added PC-98 INT 18h function AH=0Ah and\r\n    AH=0Bh to support BIOS calls that enable\r\n    \"Simple Graphics\" mode. This fixes\r\n    problems with other games having vertical\r\n    lines over the graphics, even though\r\n    these games do not appear to use the\r\n    simple graphics at all. (yksoft1)\r\n  - Added support for PC-98 \"Simple Graphics\"\r\n    mode of text layer attribute bit 4. When\r\n    enabled, the attribute bit 4 changes\r\n    meaning from vertical line to a bit\r\n    indicating that the 8-bit character is\r\n    a low resolution 2x4 bitmap to be\r\n    displayed in the text layer. This fixes\r\n    score and status display in Carat.\r\n  - PC-98 INT 18h now implements AH=31h to\r\n    report CRTC, text and graphics state and\r\n    24khz/31khz video mode selection. This\r\n    fix allows some games including Touhou\r\n    Project to pace it's gameplay correctly\r\n    in either video mode.\r\n  - MinGW HX DOS builds default to host key\r\n    F12 again\r\n  - PC-98 mode now offers selection between\r\n    24khz and 31khz video modes (yksoft1)\r\n  - KEYB.COM fixed to load only the fonts the\r\n    ROM BIOS has allocated. This fixes a guest\r\n    system crash if using KEYB.COM with\r\n    machine=ega\r\n  - Moved host key to F11 for Windows. F12 is\r\n    already taken by some internal debugging\r\n    voodoo within Windows itself.\r\n  - DOSBox-X codebase now strongly encourages\r\n    compilation with C++11, will become\r\n    required soon.\r\n  - BOOT command fixed to make it possible to\r\n    IMGMOUNT multiple floppies to drive 1, and\r\n    boot from another disk in drive 0. This\r\n    should enable the use of DOSBox-X with\r\n    PC-98 games that expect to boot from drive\r\n    A and the user to rotate through floppies\r\n    in drive B.\r\n  - IMGMOUNT fixed to support mounting with no\r\n    filesystems and multiple disk images, and\r\n    using the \"swap floppy\" command to rotate\r\n    through them.\r\n  - Added options to BOOT command that allows\r\n    specifying multiple disk images and an option\r\n    that says to swap disk images only through\r\n    one drive.\r\n  - VHD dynamic support added (shane32)\r\n  - INT 10 AH=9 background color fixed in 256-color\r\n    VGA modes.\r\n  - Intro text updated to reflect new default\r\n    key bindings.\r\n  - Mapper shortcuts not in common use now exist\r\n    without any default binding, and most existing\r\n    default bindings are now associated with the\r\n    \"host\" key.\r\n  - Added 4th modifier \"host\" key to the mapper.\r\n    This \"host\" key is F12 by default. The intent\r\n    is to eventually move most mapper shortcuts\r\n    to some combination of F12 and another key,\r\n    rather than many shortcuts scattered over the\r\n    keyboard. Existing dosbox mapper files should\r\n    continue to work.\r\n  - Renderer and 32bpp VGA display code fixed to\r\n    reorder RGBA order for correct display on Intel\r\n    Mac OS X systems. Mac OS X, on Intel systems,\r\n    uses a strange BGRA 32bpp format that requires\r\n    some adjustment on our part to display correctly.\r\n  - Added more 24bpp INT 10h VESA BIOS modes.\r\n  - Removed per-sector debug messages from VFD/FDD\r\n    image support code.\r\n0.82.5 (04/18/2018)\r\n  - Expanded memory manager memory copy fixed to\r\n    enable A20 gate temporarily so that the copy\r\n    works correctly.\r\n  - PC-98 FM board emulation now defaults to IRQ 12\r\n    instead of IRQ 3. A lot of PC-98 games seem to\r\n    have a strong preference for that IRQ with regard\r\n    to FM music.\r\n  - PC-98 reset I/O port (F0h) fixed to emulate CPU\r\n    reset according to the SHUT0 and SHUT1 state set\r\n    by the guest. Normally writing port F0h is a\r\n    signal to reset but SHUT0 and SHUT1 can be set to\r\n    indicate alternate behavior. This fixes VEMM486.EXE\r\n    (an expanded memory manager) and allows it to run,\r\n    since this manager appears to reset by port F0h\r\n    then resume execution normally. Prior to this fix,\r\n    booting a MS-DOS disk image that loads VEMM486.EXE\r\n    at startup yielded nothing but an infinite reboot\r\n    loop.\r\n  - XMS and EMS emulation fixed not to leave A20 gate\r\n    enabled unless EMS emulation is set to EMM386 and\r\n    dosbox.conf is set to run the system in virtual\r\n    8086 mode. There are plenty of DOS games that\r\n    malfunction if loaded too low in memory with the\r\n    A20 gate enabled.\r\n  - PC-98 mouse emulation, at the 8255 level, now uses\r\n    new C++ abstraction that seems to work fairly well\r\n    even with the common PC-98 MOUSE.COM driver.\r\n  - \"BOOT\" command in PC-98 mode updated to no longer\r\n    require the --force switch. Booting MS-DOS from a\r\n    hard disk or floppy disk image in PC-98 mode is\r\n    generally functional now.\r\n  - Added PC-98 SCSI/SASI hard disk emulation, and fixed\r\n    BOOT to enable booting PC-98 MS-DOS from a hard drive\r\n    (HDI image)\r\n  - FAT driver fixed to read/write logical sectors vs\r\n    actual drive sectors and removed geometry remapping\r\n    hack.\r\n  - FAT driver fixed to avoid memory corruption that\r\n    may occur if reading a partition table from a drive\r\n    that has more than 512 bytes/sector.\r\n  - .BAT file parsing fixed to handle BAT files not\r\n    in the current directory (yksoft1)\r\n  - Fixed floppy controller emulation bug that failed\r\n    to advance sectors during multi-sector read/write.\r\n  - Fixed floppy emulation bug that prevented seeking.\r\n    The \"head\" would get stuck at track 0 and never move.\r\n  - Dynamic core allows running with paging enabled again,\r\n    IF dosbox.conf says to allow it (yksoft1)\r\n  - DOS file I/O functions AH=3Fh and AH=40h updated to\r\n    reflect undocumented MS-DOS behavior that silently\r\n    truncates read/written byte count if the offset\r\n    and byte count reach beyond the end of a 64KB segment.\r\n    This fixes some demoscene productions that read 64KB-1\r\n    bytes but apparently rely on this behavior to avoid\r\n    display errors.\r\n  - FluidSynth fixes and API updates. DOSBox-X no longer\r\n    uses a private API within FluidSynth. (heftig)\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to control the size of the\r\n    DOS \"Swappable Data Area\" which is said to help with\r\n    shelling and task swapping in WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x\r\n  - Added \"minimum mcb free\", and set minimum mcb segment to\r\n    value same or similar to DOSBox SVN. The \"free\" option\r\n    directs DOSBox-X to allocate memory before that segment\r\n    value to fill memory.\r\n  - Fixed COMMAND.COM PSP segment to correctly identify it's\r\n    resident size in memory.\r\n  - COMMAND.COM in the DOSBox shell now allocates itself\r\n    normally instead of from a special segment so that it\r\n    appears normally in the MCB allocation chain.\r\n  - BIOS now clears it's stack before booting the DOS shell.\r\n  - Fix Pause (CTRL+Pause or ALT+Pause) to release all keys\r\n    in the mapper so that CTRL, ALT, or Shift are not left\r\n    \"stuck\" when emulation resumes.\r\n  - Initial host keyboard recognition, and base framework\r\n    for general keyboard language/layout handling. Keyboard\r\n    layout recognition added for Windows and Linux/X11.\r\n  - Fixed 350-line INT 10h VESA modes not to apply EGA mode\r\n    adjustments, which fixes display distortion.\r\n  - INT 10h VESA modes 720x480 and 848x480 fixed.\r\n  - Fixed INT 10h VESA emulation to round up bytes/scanline\r\n    so that 4bpp planar modes display properly.\r\n  - Fixed INT 10h VESA mode 1400x1050 16-color (4bpp planar)\r\n    mode to resolve overlapping mode number.\r\n  - Pulled in VGA vtotal + 2 fix from DOSBox SVN\r\n  - Pulled in EGA display mode fixes from DOSBox SVN to fix\r\n    EGA graphics emulation.\r\n  - Fixed INT 10h AH=1Ch (save/restore VGA state) to handle\r\n    VGA attribute controller properly so that the display is\r\n    not left blank.\r\n  - PC-98 GDC emulation fixed to handle START DISPLAY properly\r\n    by un-blanking the display (fixes \"Ellena\")\r\n  - Fixed possible format string vulnerabilities (gnustomp)\r\n  - Added menu options to enable/disable EGC and GRCG\r\n    emulation (yksoft1)\r\n  - Added options to enable/disable EGC and GRCG emulation\r\n    (to emulate older hardware).\r\n  - Added PC-98 BIOS function to read 8x16 character bitmaps,\r\n    which fixes \"Power Dolls 2\"\r\n  - BIOS now reports 16-color and EGC graphics. Some games\r\n    that check the BIOS for capabilities may now begin to\r\n    use 16-color graphics and EGC functions.\r\n  - Added PC-98 INT 18h function to read character font.\r\n    This also resolves garbled text in TH01.\r\n  - PC-98 GDC emulation now uses cursor specification\r\n    (line per character row) to determine whether graphics\r\n    are doubled vertically or not. Several PC-98 games\r\n    switch between 200-line (doubled) and 400-line graphics\r\n    by programming the GDC directly, rather than through\r\n    the BIOS.\r\n  - Added various video-related BIOS variables to the data\r\n    in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - GDC RESET/SYNC debug text updated to indicate which GDC\r\n    is undergoing the RESET/SYNC.\r\n  - Debugger \"LOG\" command (CPU execution logging) fixed to\r\n    automatically stop logging when the BIOS begins the\r\n    POST routine after system reset. The user who invoked\r\n    \"LOG\" probably cares more about what happened up to the\r\n    game crash, fault and reset rather than normal BIOS startup.\r\n  - BIOS now properly unmasks the PC-98 cascade IRQ, which\r\n    allows IRQ 8-15 to function, including the mouse (IRQ13)\r\n  - Debugger interface now indicates whether 80386 paging is\r\n    enabled or not at any time.\r\n  - Help text updates to reflect DOSBox-X changes (Shane32)\r\n  - BIOS INT 13h emulation updated to support up to 4 hard\r\n    drives (Shane32)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT and BOOT code cleanup (Shane32)\r\n  - IMGMOUNT RAM drive support: Additional fixes and geometry\r\n    work done, and some hangs resolved (Shane32)\r\n  - CPU emulation fixed to allow setting a breakpoint on\r\n    ANY interrupt of a specific number, not just software\r\n    interrupts. It is now possible to use BPINT to break\r\n    upon hardware (IRQ) interrupts.\r\n  - DOS kernel fixed to drop to the debugger if the MCB\r\n    (memory control block) chain is corrupted, so that\r\n    the corrupted state can be examined. When the debugger\r\n    continues execution, a full restart of the DOS kernel\r\n    is run. If DOSBox-X was compiled without the debugger,\r\n    then the normal E_Exit() path is still taken.\r\n  - Added debugger command to show, and modify, the state\r\n    of the PIC (interrupt controller).\r\n  - Added debugger command to view or change the A20 gate.\r\n  - Added debugger command to view the state of EMS, memory\r\n    handles, allocation, and EMS page frame mapping.\r\n  - Added debugger command to view the state of XMS, memory\r\n    handles, and allocation.\r\n  - Added debugger command to view the layout of the ROM\r\n    BIOS region (0xF0000-0xFFFFF) chosen by emulation.\r\n  - DOS kernel now logs kernel allocations, which can be\r\n    seen in the debugger using the \"DOS KERN\" command.\r\n  - Added \"RUN\" command as an alternative to hitting F5.\r\n  - Added \"RUNWATCH\" to the debugger, so that watching the\r\n    system run in the debugger is possible.\r\n  - Debugger data window can now be used to view memory in\r\n    segmented, virtual (through paging), and physical (bus\r\n    address) modes.\r\n  - Debugger window data and code view windows now indicate\r\n    regions of memory that are beyond the end of the segment.\r\n  - Debugger window data and code view windows now indicate\r\n    regions of memory that are paged out (will cause a page\r\n    fault if accessed)\r\n  - PC-98 A20 gate I/O port F6h fixed to work properly as an\r\n    enable or disable, rather than just an enable. The PC-98\r\n    version of HIMEM.SYS no longer complains about not being\r\n    able to control the A20 gate.\r\n  - IMGMOUNT RAM drive support: Ramdrive bug fixes and changed\r\n    drive limits from ATA limits to BIOS/MBR (Shane32)\r\n  - INT 21h fixed to use BIOS INT 1Ch to read date and time in\r\n    PC-98 mode. Arrowgun now runs properly.\r\n  - Fixed EMS emulation not to claim XMS memory (and zero BIOS\r\n    extended memory size) if EMS emulation is in EMS board mode\r\n    (and therefore not allocating extended memory through HIMEM.SYS).\r\n  - PC-98 INT 1Fh extended memory copy implemented. DOS games in\r\n    PC-98 mode can now use this API to access extended memory.\r\n  - Fixed HIMEM.SYS emulation in PC-98 mode to zero BIOS extended\r\n    memory values when claiming extended memory.\r\n  - PC-98 mode now sets BIOS data area values correctly regarding\r\n    conventional and extended memory.\r\n  - Added rudimentary emulation of non-volatile RAM at the\r\n    trailing edge of text RAM (A3FE0-A3FFF).\r\n  - PC-98 mode now adds additional BIOS data values at boot time\r\n    so that guest OSes like PC-98 MS-DOS can see the floppy drive,\r\n    see keyboard input, and determine the boot drive properly.\r\n    It is now possible to boot MS-DOS in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - Added rudimentary PC-98 INT 1Bh BIOS interrupt, at least for\r\n    floppy disk emulation.\r\n  - Cleanup and formatting enhancements to IMGMOUNT ramdisk (Shane32)\r\n  - DOS CON emulation in PC-98 mode now emulates two additional\r\n    ANSI escapes to clear the screen that are specific to NEC's\r\n    MS-DOS implementation, which fixes text layer problems with\r\n    Rusty.\r\n  - PC-98 GDC dip switch 2-8 emulation fixed. It was backwards.\r\n    This may break existing dosbox.conf configurations, apologies\r\n    in advance.\r\n  - Added -xms option to LOADFIX command. When given, the command\r\n    consumes extended memory instead of conventional memory.\r\n  - HIMEM.SYS emulation fixed to behave more like Microsoft's\r\n    HIMEM.SYS implementation regarding global & local A20 gate\r\n    control.\r\n  - Mac OS X builds fixed to work from the user's home directory\r\n    if run from the Finder, instead of trying to operate at the\r\n    root of the filesystem as directed by the Finder.\r\n  - Mac OS X builds now put the FREECG98.BMP file inside of the\r\n    .app bundle, and fall back to it if not found in the current\r\n    directory.\r\n  - RPM builds now install FREECG98.BMP in /usr/share/dosbox-x\r\n    and refer to it if not in your local directory, in order to\r\n    better provide PC-98 emulation.\r\n  - PC-98 BOOT command: Loading addresses and CPU register layout\r\n    updated to match actual hardware behavior, in which the boot\r\n    sector is loaded at just under 128KB.\r\n  - Build updates to support compiling for Windows with MinGW.\r\n  - BOOT now accepts a --debug switch that causes DOSBox-X to break into\r\n    the debugger when the boot sector begins to execute.\r\n  - BOOT now accepts a --force switch to override the PC-98 lockout,\r\n    if the user wants to better understand why I locked it out in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - PC-98 support now supports reading font from FONT.ROM, if available.\r\n  - Code, data, and output now respond to arrow, page up/down and\r\n    home/end keys as a user would normally expect.\r\n  - Arrow and page up/down keyboard input now goes to active window\r\n    instead of mapping directly to any specific window.\r\n  - Debugger interface now has the concept of an \"active\" window, and\r\n    the title bar of each window hilights if it is active.\r\n  - Debugger interface now hides the \"variables\" window by default.\r\n  - Fixed window \"titles\" in debugger interface to fill the terminal\r\n    line they're on and use ncurses horizontal line character which\r\n    on modern systems looks better than hyphens.\r\n  - Removed one line padding around data window in debugger interface.\r\n  - Debugger interface redesigned to permit more flexible layout\r\n  - Debugger interface no longer crashes when terminal window is sized\r\n    down too small (when there is no room for the output window)\r\n  - EMM386 (ems) emulation fixed to always turn on the A20 gate when\r\n    the DOS application requests to map pages into the EMS page frame.\r\n    This fixes crashes with Creative's Sound Blaster 16 installer when\r\n    run with the A20 gate turned off.\r\n0.82.4 (02/28/2018)\r\n  - Updated ramdisk formatting code to better match FAT12/FAT16\r\n    specifications and limits (Shane32)\r\n  - Menu items related to Gravis Ultrasound, Glide emulation, Innova SID,\r\n    and other IBM PC-specific options are now grayed out in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - Updated Windows menus to gray out CPU core and type options that\r\n    are invalid. Selecting a prefetch CPU type while core dynamic is\r\n    no longer possible, and selecting dynamic core while using a\r\n    prefetch cpu type is no longer possible.\r\n  - CPU type submenu in Windows updated to reflect all types supported\r\n    by DOSBox-X including 8086 and 286 cores.\r\n  - Fixed E_Exit() crash on Windows in PDCurses endwin() that only\r\n    happens if you had never brought up the debugger console window.\r\n  - Minor oddities with OPNA stereo panning resolved.\r\n  - Sound Blaster, Adlib, and PC-98 FM emulation now reset state\r\n    correctly when the reset signal is given to avoid stuck notes.\r\n  - Fixed BIOS logo in PC-98 mode to properly reset the graphics mode\r\n    so that the logo is visible.\r\n  - Added Windows menu items to control PC-98 GDC speed, 4-partition enable,\r\n    200-line \"scanline\" effect enable, and PIT timer clock control.\r\n  - Added \"Restart DOS\" command to the Windows menu, with code to\r\n    allow it only if at the initial DOS shell.\r\n  - Added \"multi-track WAV\" command to the Windows menu, under Capture\r\n  - Added \"reset system\" command to the Windows menu\r\n  - \"Restart\" menu command updated to clarify that it restarts DOSBox-X entirely.\r\n  - OpenGL HQ output removed.\r\n  - Commands to force driver (DirectX or WINDIB) removed.\r\n  - Default disk I/O limit raised to more reasonable speeds.\r\n  - FM code borrowed from Neko Project II now compiles on Mac OS X\r\n  - IMGMOUNT now supports mounting a RAM drive (using -t ram) (Shane32)\r\n  - Direct3D fullscreen aspect ratio fixes, especially for\r\n    monitors with a 5:4 aspect ratio (such as 1280x1024) (Shane32)\r\n  - \"Show menu\" in Windows builds system menu is now a toggle\r\n    to show/hide the menu bar (Shane32)\r\n  - Fixed broken color palette with CGA composite and EGA\r\n    machine emulation. Composite CGA and machine=ega displays\r\n    properly again.\r\n  - According to documentation, IBM PC and PC-98 use different\r\n    initial PC speaker frequencies. Update the code to match.\r\n  - 8254 I/O port alias at 3FD9h-3FDFh added, which is needed\r\n    for several PC-98 games that program the PC speaker\r\n    frequency through those ports instead of through 71h-77h\r\n  - New Intel 8255 emulation. PC-98 system 8255 emulation\r\n    now uses this emulation, along with PC speaker emulation.\r\n  - Fixed XMS memory copy functions to enable the A20\r\n    gate so extended memory copies work correctly whether\r\n    or not the DOS application in question made the call\r\n    with A20 enabled. This fixes crashes and memory\r\n    corruption while installing Windows 3.1 using SETUP.EXE.\r\n  - \"CLS\" now sends the proper ANSI escapes to clear the\r\n    console in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - BIOS logo in PC-98 fixed to clear graphics RAM and\r\n    set graphics back to 8-color digital mode when booting\r\n    to DOS. This should fix palette errors and color issues\r\n    with older PC-98/PC-88 games that use the 8-color\r\n    graphics modes.\r\n  - Added PC-98 INT 1Ch timer interval BIOS function,\r\n    and timer countdown routine in IRQ 0.\r\n  - Windows builds now incorporate pdcurses and enable\r\n    the debugger interface (bulletshot60)\r\n  - DOSBox-X now tracks the systemwide keyboard layout\r\n    on Windows, and acts on user changes to the keyboard\r\n    and language in the system.\r\n  - Removed hack code in SDL 1.x that sets DOSBox-X's\r\n    keyboard layout to the US layout even if the host\r\n    uses anything else.\r\n  - Fix CPU cycles count increment not to nag you to use\r\n    core=dynamic if a) dynamic core is not available or\r\n    b) you're already using dynamic core.\r\n  - Added dynamic core back, it seems to be very stable\r\n    again.\r\n  - PC-98 FM board now allows changing the base I/O port\r\n    and IRQ (interrupt) line used by the card.\r\n  - PC-98 mode now supports joystick emulation. Joystick\r\n    input is mapped through the DOSBox mapper to the\r\n    PC-98 FM board where DOS games expect to see it.\r\n  - Added dosbox.conf option to select which PC-98 FM\r\n    board to emulate.\r\n  - Fixed PC-98 FM code to enable the ADPCM and Rhythm\r\n    FM channels.\r\n  - Re-ported Neko Project II FM board emulation, this\r\n    time keeping the code intact and keeping the separate\r\n    board emulations intact for PC-98 mode.\r\n  - VGA palette errors with Crystal Dream II fixed.\r\n  - PC-98 FM synthesis fixed not to initialize itself\r\n    again when rebooting, which fixes a problem with\r\n    garbled FM synthesis after rebooting.\r\n  - Removed some now-unnecessary SDL Video quit/init\r\n    calls from Windows builds.\r\n  - machine=pc98 now starts entire emulation in PC-98\r\n    mode instead of booting up in IBM PC mode and\r\n    switching to PC-98 mode.\r\n  - Initial \"BIOS\" startup screen now operates in\r\n    PC-98 mode when machine=pc98.\r\n  - Prefetch core debug code now disabled at compile\r\n    time. Seems to be stable so far.\r\n  - Prefetch core now emulates partial load of the\r\n    prefetch buffer on miss, and completing the buffer\r\n    fill on hit, to better emulate (probable) 80486\r\n    behavior.\r\n  - 486_prefetch is now a valid cputype setting, despite\r\n    the setting having existed for years in the source\r\n    code. Prior to this fix, 486_prefetch was ignored.\r\n0.82.3 (02/13/2018)\r\n  - Removed DOSBox SVN-style \"fast\" A20 gate emulation.\r\n    Recent changes make it infeasible to keep. \"fast\" is\r\n    now mapped to \"mask\" mode.\r\n  - RAM aliasing is now always on, even if memalias is not\r\n    set, in order to help enforce A20 gate behavior, and\r\n    to fix emulator crashes when a non-aliased RAM page\r\n    is referenced through an alias.\r\n  - Cleanup and rewrite of prefetch core, to make the code\r\n    cleaner and more readable and maintainable.\r\n  - DOS file I/O updated to apply a proper delay rather\r\n    than the old DOSBox SVN code's cycle count dependent\r\n    method. The delay by default will slow disk I/O down\r\n    to mid 1990's IDE PIO speeds, which can resolve issues\r\n    with MS-DOS demoscene or game executables that can\r\n    malfunction when disk I/O is too fast.\r\n  - PIC code updated to enforce a proper IRQ delay on ALL\r\n    IRQ signals, which fixes issues with MS-DOS executables\r\n    that have race conditions between their code and their\r\n    interrupt handlers.\r\n  - DOS Shell now shows the full intro text only at first\r\n    run, instead of every shell invocation.\r\n  - Use FCB record size of 128 bytes if the FCB record size\r\n    is zero (from DOSBox SVN).\r\n  - PC speaker fix not to generate a continuous tone if\r\n    the PIT timer was set to mode 0. This fixes issues with\r\n    many early 1990s demoscene executables leaving the PC\r\n    speaker enabled (BEEEEEEP).\r\n  - Register DEBUGBOX.COM at DOS environment start instead\r\n    of boot, which allows the command to work again.\r\n  - EXE loader sets stack pointer (SS:SP) into PSP segment\r\n    (from DOSBox SVN)\r\n  - EXE loader fixed to use the larger of the minimum and\r\n    maximum memory sizes listed in the EXE header, which\r\n    fixes some demoscene executables with a minimum size\r\n    larger than maximum.\r\n  - VGA DAC (palette) emulation updated to better match\r\n    actual SVGA chipset (Paradise SVGA) behavior, which\r\n    fixes some VGA palette errors in some demoscene\r\n    productions.\r\n  - Added -nocachedir option to internal MOUNT command, to\r\n    disable directory caching for a local folder mounted\r\n    to a drive letter. When mounted this way, changes on\r\n    the host filesystem are immediately visible in the\r\n    guest DOS environment.\r\n  - Added -ro and -rw options to internal MOUNT command, to\r\n    allow mounting local folders to a drive letter as a\r\n    read-only volume.\r\n  - MIDI Fluidsynth fixed to initialize and free state properly\r\n    so that switching to and from Fluidsynth doesn't cause\r\n    a segfault or crash.\r\n  - MPU-401 fixed to allow changes to MIDI configuration from\r\n    CONFIG.COM.\r\n  - DOS filename handling fixed to maintain ASCII conversion\r\n    to uppercase, while not converting Shift-JIS double-byte\r\n    characters in PC-98 mode. This fixes Shift-JIS filename\r\n    corruption when the trailing byte can be mistaken for\r\n    lowercase ASCII a to z.\r\n  - Windows fixes to keep menu bar items updated with\r\n    DOSBox-X state.\r\n  - Remove WM_DROPFILES handling, for now. The code remains\r\n    to allow re-enabling later.\r\n  - SDL 1.x builds fixed to process only WM_COMMAND (menu\r\n    bar) and WM_SYSCOMMAND (system menu) events so that\r\n    the general chatter in modern Windows system does not\r\n    drown out the messages. This fixes issues where the\r\n    menu bar doesn't work on some systems.\r\n  - SDL 1.x builds fixed to handle menu bar input using\r\n    SDL's WM events instead of fighting with SDL's message\r\n    pump to receive menu events. This fixes potential\r\n    issues with losing menu bar events.\r\n  - dosbox.conf reference included with Windows builds\r\n    now uses MS-DOS line endings so that the file can be\r\n    edited in NOTEPAD.EXE\r\n  - New dosbox.conf option to control whether the menu is\r\n    shown by default in Windows builds.\r\n  - titlebar= SDL dosbox.conf option, to allow showing a more\r\n    user friendly name for the program instead of just using\r\n    the EXE name.\r\n  - E_Exit() on Windows now displays the message using\r\n    MessageBox() in addition to sending to STDERR, so that\r\n    Windows users see the error even if they are running\r\n    it from the desktop instead of the command line.\r\n  - PC-98 EGC bit shifter emulation fixed to correctly support\r\n    ascending and descending bit shifting in either direction.\r\n    This fixes screen shake emulation errors with Touhou Project\r\n    TH04 and TH05.\r\n  - Linux/X11 fixes to SDL 1.x to better match and compare\r\n    Visuals (descriptions of the screen) since X11 libraries\r\n    don't seem to use the same pointer values for the same\r\n    Visuals.\r\n  - ALT+TAB or loss of focus from fullscreen in Windows now\r\n    restores the window instead of minimizing it.\r\n  - 3Dfx OpenGL will hide the minimize and maximize buttons\r\n    in Windows while active.\r\n  - Windows menu bar items are now grayed out when 3Dfx OpenGL\r\n    emulation is active (items that cannot be used at that time).\r\n  - Fix Windows system menu to always keep \"show menu\".\r\n  - GFX rendering fixed not to render any output while 3Dfx\r\n    OpenGL emulation is active.\r\n  - 3Dfx OpenGL bug fixes to properly restore the DOS console\r\n    when the 3Dfx card is de-initialized and the game returns\r\n    to the DOS prompt.\r\n  - Linux/X11 window output fixed to keep the window on the\r\n    screen even when switching between OpenGL and non-OpenGL,\r\n    and when setting the SDL video mode.\r\n  - Remove some init hacks and SDL forced reinitialized hacks,\r\n    so that the window is stable on the screen.\r\n  - Added code to do more OpenGL state initialization (both\r\n    output=opengl and when initializing 3Dfx OpenGL emulation)\r\n    to make more consistent output.\r\n  - 3Dfx voodoo OpenGL based emulation fixed to switch out of\r\n    fullscreen mode IF DOSBox-X was fullscreen at the time the\r\n    card is initialized.\r\n  - 3Dfx voodoo OpenGL based emulation no longer allows fullscreen\r\n    mode, and does everything it can to prevent window resizing.\r\n  - Linux/X11 disable XRandR, XV, and X modeset functions. Do not\r\n    change monitor resolution.\r\n  - MPU-401 MIDI emulation fixed to look at all conductor message\r\n    bytes for code 0xFC (ALL END) instead of just the first byte.\r\n    This fixes hangs in games that send additional bytes prior to\r\n    0xFC and then expect the MPU-401 to signal 0xFC back when the\r\n    games are waiting for music to stop.\r\n  - Fix DOS CON driver not to signal data ready for PC-98 scan\r\n    codes that have no corresponding ANSI code. Tapping numeric\r\n    keypad keys during the title screen in Touhou Project should\r\n    no longer cause the game to pause waiting for keyboard input\r\n    when going into demo mode.\r\n  - Fix DOS CON driver to signal data ready for buffered escape\r\n    code.\r\n  - Fix PC-98 keyboard emulation not to apply IBM PC \"extended\"\r\n    keyboard scancode filtering.\r\n  - Window maximization does not count as a user resize preference.\r\n  - Fix Windows builds to enable DirectSerial, Direct LPT, modem,\r\n    emulation.\r\n  - New mapper shortcut to restore the window's original size.\r\n  - Fix bug with SHL instruction and OF flag, which corrects some\r\n    games and their decompression routines.\r\n  - Fullscreen (monitor) modesetting removed. DOSBox-X either runs\r\n    in a window, or scales up to fill the monitor, but will not change\r\n    the monitor resolution.\r\n  - Resize handling fixed to differentiate user resize verses resize\r\n    caused by DOSBox-X changing the window dimensions.\r\n  - Linux/X11 fixes to avoid flickering when resizing the window, and\r\n    to avoid redrawing unless necessary.\r\n  - Window resize management, to scale/arrange the output to fit the\r\n    window (for output= surface, opengl, direct3d)\r\n  - Enable resizing again, except when the GUI or mapper is active.\r\n  - Fix Linux/X11 to always take resize events, instead of ignoring\r\n    all further resize events just because one resize event is forever\r\n    \"pending\"\r\n  - Linux/X11 builds now track the size of the window on the desktop,\r\n    to keep track of resizing and maximizing.\r\n0.82.2 (01/29/2018)\r\n  - Linux builds no longer enable window resizing. The ability to\r\n    resize will be added back when the emulator can better handle\r\n    the user resizing the window.\r\n  - Windows and Linux now have synchronized build date and version\r\n    strings.\r\n  - Codebase begin transition to C++11\r\n  - The Windows maximize button no longer triggers fullscreen mode.\r\n  - Direct3D, OpenGL, and Surface outputs updated to fill the window\r\n    in Windows builds when the window is maximized. If aspect\r\n    correction is enabled, the Direct3D and OpenGL outputs will\r\n    scale the DOS screen (with pillarbox/letterbox padding) to the\r\n    correct aspect ratio and center within the maximized window.\r\n  - Fixed minor memory leak in MT32 (MUNT) synthesizer usage.\r\n  - Fixed uninitialized state issues with DMA channel 4 (cascade).\r\n  - IMGMOUNT now allows mounting the El Torito bootable floppy image\r\n    of a CD-ROM drive as a drive letter and accessible (read only)\r\n    filesystem. The FAT filesystem driver was fixed to support working\r\n    from sources other than a direct file.\r\n  - PC-98 mode fixed not to register certain built-in commands and\r\n    binaries to drive Z:\\ that are not compatible with PC-98 mode.\r\n    MEM.EXE in particular uses IBM PC-specific techniques to gather\r\n    it's information, and is therefore incompatible with PC-98 mode.\r\n    This can be verified from the source code as MEM.EXE was evidently\r\n    borrowed from the FreeDOS project.\r\n  - EGA emulation (machine=ega) fixed to render 8bpp (256-color mode)\r\n    instead of full 32bpp VGA output. EGA video output is limited to\r\n    64-color (6-bit) by the design of the video connector (2-bit R/G/B)\r\n    therefore the full precision of 32bpp is not needed. This will also\r\n    benefit video capture as the reduced color bit depth will result\r\n    in smaller AVI files when recording gameplay.\r\n  - Added code to correctly detect 15-bit highcolor vs 16-bit highcolor\r\n    display format support, despite SDL falsely indicating 16-bit\r\n    color in both cases, which fixes incorrect colors on 15-bit display\r\n    modes.\r\n  - Fix up VGA DAC/palette mapping to display the emulator screen\r\n    properly on 16-bit true color displays. Fixed off-by-one shift\r\n    mistake in the DOSBox-X render scaler code that caused\r\n    green and purple tints to colors on 16-bit true color displays.\r\n  - Add \"Show menu bar\" command to the Windows \"system menu\" so that\r\n    the menu bar can be brought back after selecting \"hide menu bar\".\r\n  - Losing window focus while fullscreen no longer leaves the emulator\r\n    window blank.\r\n  - Maximize/restore fullscreen cleanup.\r\n  - Removed DDRAW output.\r\n  - Fix FAT filesystem driver to clear \"success\" flag at all failure\r\n    return points. This fixes problems where unrecognizable FAT\r\n    filesystems are nonetheless presented as a drive letter with\r\n    garbled filenames, when IMGMOUNT should have displayed an error\r\n    instead.\r\n  - Fix FAT filesystem driver to allow PC-98 HDI images to load that\r\n    have headcount == 0 in the BPB.\r\n  - Fix Adlib emulation not to register a mapper handler if emulation\r\n    will jump to PC-98 mode, and fix mapper handler to check if Adlib\r\n    emulation is loaded to avoid segfault.\r\n  - Add \"recording\" volume to control the loudness of the audio going\r\n    out to capture (WAV, AVI, etc.)\r\n  - Separate mixer rendering from master volume. Apply master volume\r\n    at the sound card only, leave audio at full volume for recording\r\n    (WAV, AVI, etc. capture).\r\n  - dosbox.conf and command line option to log CON driver output to\r\n    a file. Anything written to STDOUT/CON by a DOS application is\r\n    logged this way.\r\n  - --time-limit <n> command line option to put a time limit on the\r\n    emulator, in seconds.\r\n  - Keyboard shortcut for the mapper UI no longer leaves keys \"stuck\"\r\n    in the guest to cause problems when you exit the mapper UI.\r\n  - Fixed code mistake that caused OpenGL NB output when dosbox.conf\r\n    specified output=opengl\r\n  - Mapper layout fixes:\r\n    - Shortcut buttons (on the right hand side of the UI) fixed to\r\n      become two columns wide if the button text won't fit in one\r\n      column.\r\n    - Some shortcut button titles shortened.\r\n  - Mapper UI updated to show which bindings are being activated by\r\n    hilighting buttons in the UI.\r\n  - Mapper UI modifier buttons indicate status through hilighting.\r\n  - Mapper UI joystick buttons and axes now use hilighting to indicate\r\n    that there is input from the device.\r\n  - Mapper fix for 4-axis joysticks that may count zero buttons, and\r\n    then crash (divide by zero) when the user pushes a button on the\r\n    joystick device.\r\n  - BIOS emulation now allows you to specify binary blobs to execute\r\n    in the guest system as part of startup. One can be specified to\r\n    execute just after CPU reset/power-on, and the other just before\r\n    booting to the DOS shell. THE BINARY BLOBS EXECUTE IN THE GUEST\r\n    ENVIRONMENT AND NOT AS ARBITRARY CODE ON YOUR HOST. This option\r\n    is provided for both automated testing and for the curious who\r\n    may want to venture into low level ASM hacking.\r\n  - INTRO.COM fixed to accept keyboard input correctly in both\r\n    PC-98 and IBM PC mode.

It is now always on,\r\n    except for internal cases where it needs to be off for callback\r\n    instructions to do their work properly.\r\n  - Removed dynamic x86 core. It is old and unmaintained code that\r\n    is incompatible with the non-recursive page fault system.\r\n  - IRQ cascade interrupt fixes and cleanup.\r\n  - BAT files given on the command line fixed to occur AFTER the\r\n    registration of ULTRASND and BLASTER environment variables.\r\n  - PC-98: DOS CON emulation fixed to decode Shift-JIS itself,\r\n    with consideration that some proprietary double-byte encodings\r\n    yield single-wide characters. DOS program using NEC's proprietary\r\n    box/line drawing characters this way should display properly now.\r\n  - DOSBox shell \"greeting\" now displays a proper box in PC-98 mode\r\n    instead of framing the text in rows and columns of Katakana. (basic2004)\r\n\r\n0.82.1 (12/25/2017)\r\n  - Windows builds no longer redirect stdout and stderr to\r\n    stdout.txt and stderr.txt.

This allows DOS games to use extended\r\n    characters in a way that does not cause invalid filenames\r\n    on the host. The host is always assumed to support unicode.\r\n    Windows builds will use wide char (UTF-16) host names and\r\n    Linux/Mac OS X builds will use UTF-8.\r\n  - Code page translation for 437 (US MS-DOS) and 932 (PC-98 Shift-JIS).\r\n  - Emulate DOS console function key row in PC-98 mode.\r\n  - PC-98 EGC graphics emulation (minimal)\r\n  - PC-98 CG support for custom fonts (RAM portion)\r\n  - PC-98 EGC minimal ROP emulation\r\n  - PC-98 select between 2.5MHZ and 5MHz GDC (for games that demand one or the other)\r\n  - Aspect ratio menu item in Windows works correctly now\r\n  - Capture menu works correctly now\r\n  - Removed \"overlay\" output\r\n  - Fix Direct3D and OpenGL output to enable linear interpolation (smoothing)\r\n  - Fixed \"double aspect ratio\" issue with OpenGL output\r\n  - Linux builds compiled against SDL 1.x and running against PulseAudio\r\n    no longer hang/crash after some random amount of time (threading conflict)\r\n  - PC-98 minimal mouse emulation\r\n  - VGA doublescan=false fixed to display correctly, especially with scalers\r\n  - SDL 1.x Windows builds fixed to process mouse motion FIRST before\r\n    mouse buttons so that guest pointer integration with Windows 3.1\r\n    works properly.\r\n  - SDL 1.x Windows builds now enforce a 60Hz cap on mouse motion\r\n    detection because recent versions of Windows have some latency\r\n    when SDL repositions the mouse cursor.

          "content": "## First steps\n\nBefore contributing to DOSBox-X, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues) to see whether your potential contribution is already being discussed, or if you'd like to discuss about it first.\n\n## Scope of contributions that are welcome\n\n- The normal operation of DOS games and applications within DOSBox-X \n- DOS, Windows 1.0/2.x/3.x and Windows 95/98/ME guest system support\n- Architectural symmetry with a real DOS environment (particularly MS-DOS or PC DOS)\n- Improving the user interface, general functions and usability of DOSBox-X\n- Improving a platform-specific build of DOSBox-X or getting it on par with other platforms supported\n- Non-implemented (or incorrectly implemented) system calls or functions\n- Missing, incorrect, or inaccurate hardware emulation, e.g. video, sound, input\n- Bug fixes and/or improvements that allow different types of DOS software to run in DOSBox-X\n\nOur goal is to eventually make DOSBox-X a complete emulation package that covers all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 3.x/9x based system scenarios. Compared with DOSBox, DOSBox-X focuses more on general emulation and accuracy. It is our hope to give users all the options to tweak and configure the DOS virtual machine, from original IBM PC hardware with 64KB of RAM all the way up to late 1990's hardware, whatever it takes to get the DOS game or software package to run, and give users the feeling that they are running native DOS systems. Help is greatly appreciated since the main project developer only has limited time to work on DOSBox-X. We also hope that DOSBox-X (along with [DOSLIB](https://github.com/joncampbell123/doslib) and [Hackipedia](http://hackipedia.org/)) can [help with new DOS developments](https://dosbox-x.com/newdosdevelopment.html).\n\nYou do not necessarily need to be versed in coding; there are other ways to contribute to the project as well. For example, you can submit bug reports and suggest enhancements or other improvements in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues). General conversations and helping other DOSBox-X users (e.g. suggesting solutions to their problems) are appreciated as well. You may also help improve DOSBox-X's website and documentation (such as the [DOSBox-X Wiki](https://dosbox-x.com/wiki)), translate its language file to another language, and/or help packaging the software for different platforms.\n\n\n## Code\n\nInformation on building/compiling the DOSBox-X source code can be found in the [BUILD](BUILD.md) page.\n\nDOSBox-X is still intended to support compilation as C++11. If you add new code please make sure it works as C++11. One way to do so is to run `./configure` with `--enable-force-cxx11` option added, and build the code.\n\nFor the code style, please refer to the .editorconfig file, your development environment probably supports it (see https://editorconfig.org/).\n\nThe emphasis is put on code clarity, simplicity and documented whenever possible.\n\nDocumenting can be 'dynamic', Doxygen-commented methods are preferred but evocative method names are also accepted as long as they're self-explanative.\n\nRecommendations about coding:\n- favor the writing of short methods, opposed to long methods, with the exception for really simple to understand code\n- maximize code reuse, i.e. don't repeat yourself (DRY)\n- simplify your code path for extra clarity, avoid crazing nesting\n\nObviously when you'll dig in, you will quickly spot that there are many places where these rules are simply not followed ! Over the years, hundreds of people have worked on DOSBox (which DOSBox-X is a fork of), while that helped to raise this project to where it is today, it certainly didn't in terms of clean code. But keep the faith, a huge code cleanup endeavor has started with the goal to raise the metrics of DOSBox-X guts, hopefully ASAP.\n\nFor more descriptions of the source code, please take a look at the [DOSBox-X source code description](README.source-code-description) page. Information about the debugger is also available in the [DOSBox-X Debugger](README.debugger) page.\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) page for general information on contributing to or getting support from the project.\n\nThat said, welcome to this repository !\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\r\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\r\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\r\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n\r\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\f\r\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\r\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\nalong with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\n    parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\f\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n\r\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\r\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\f\r\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\f\r\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\r\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\f\r\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\r\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., \r\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\r\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\r\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\r\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\r\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\n\r\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\r\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\r\nproprietary programs.

          "content": "DOSBox-X Installation and Released Packages\r\n===========================================\r\n\r\nDOSBox-X is a cross-platform DOS emulator based on DOSBox, with the eventual goal of being a complete DOS emulation package. New versions of DOSBox-X are released periodically, typically on the last day of a month or the first day of the next month. Since DOSBox-X is cross-platform, all major host operating systems are officially supported including Windows (Win9x, NT4, XP or later), Linux (with X11), macOS (10.15 or later) and pure DOS.\r\n\r\nPre-compiled binaries for Windows, Linux, macOS, and DOS as well as the source code are officially available.\r\nLinks to the current version can be found in the [DOSBox-X homepage](https://dosbox-x.com/), and all released versions along with their change logs can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases) page.\r\n\r\n**Binaries are automatically built upon release by github system, however, sometimes fails to upload. If you find a file for a particular platform not available, try the [Development(Nightly) build](https://dosbox-x.com/devel-build.html) instead.** You need to sign in to github in order to download those builds.\r\n\r\nOnce you get DOSBox-X installed and running, you probably want to look at the DOSBox-X user guide in the [DOSBox-X Wiki](https://dosbox-x.com/wiki) for usage information.\r\n\r\n## SDL1 and SDL2 builds\r\n\r\nFor most packages there are both SDL1 and SDL2 builds, and most features are the same for both builds. While SDL1 builds may be the default one to use, you may want to try SDL2 builds if you want certain features specific to SDL2 builds (such as the raw mouse input option, touchscreen support) or you encounter specific issue(s) with SDL1 builds (such as incorrect keys in some international keyboard layouts).\r\n\r\n## Packages for Supported Platforms\r\n\r\n- [Windows Packages (Installer or Portable)](#windows-packages-installer-or-portable)\r\n- [Linux Packages (Flatpak and more)](#linux-packages-flatpak-and-more)\r\n- [macOS Packages (Portable)](#macos-packages-portable)\r\n- [DOS Packages (Portable)](#dos-packages-portable)\r\n- [Source Code Packages (zip or tar.gz)](#source-code-packages-zip-or-targz)\r\n\r\n## Windows Packages (Installer or Portable)\r\n\r\n**It is recommended to use the Windows installer found in the [DOSBox-X homepage](https://dosbox-x.com/) for the ease and more complete installations, especially for new and non-expert users.**\r\n\r\nThe installer allows you to specify the install folder and the default build to run (VS/MinGW, 32/64-bit, SDL1/SDL2, and Intel/ARM). You can also choose to install all available builds. A quick start guide is also included in the package, and shell context menus can be added for a fast launch of DOSBox-X from the Windows Explorer.\r\n\r\nThe Visual Studio (VS) builds are the default Windows builds to use. On the other hand, MinGW builds support the Slirp backend for the NE2000 networking but won't run on Windows XP/Vista. You may also want to use one of the MinGW builds if you encounter specific problem(s) with the Visual Studio builds (such as floating point precision issues). \r\n\r\nIf you see the message ```Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting``` when running an installer, you can solve it by clicking the link \"More info\" in the dialog and then \"Run anyway\".\r\n\r\nYou can also easily upgrade DOSBox-X to the new version with the Windows installer. The installer in fact offers an option to automatically upgrade the config file (dosbox-x.conf) to the new version format while keeping all the user-customized settings already made.\r\n\r\nApart from the Windows installers, you can also find portable zip files starting with `dosbox-x-vsbuild-` and `dosbox-x-mingw-win` in the [Releases](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases) page as an alternative way to install DOSBox-X. In the zip file you will find `Release` and `Release SDL2` folders, which correspond to SDL1 and SDL2 respectively.  \r\n\r\nRegarding Joystick support, the *SDL1 builds requires XInput compatible devices*. If your joystick is not Xinput compatible, you may want to try the SDL2 builds or DirectInput to XInput wrappers such as [Xoutput](https://github.com/csutorasa/XOutput) or [Xbox 360 controller emulator](https://www.x360ce.com/).\r\n\r\n* Windows 9x/NT4/2000 users should use the MinGW lowend 9x builds (32-bit SDL1 only). \r\n* Windows XP users must use the XP compatible installer with \"XP\" in the file name, which includes Visual Studio XP builds and the 32-bit MinGW low-end builds. Note that not all features are available in the MinGW low-end builds, currently Slirp support is known to be missing. You also need to install the [DirectX runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) or DOSBox-X will complain you're missing `XInput9_1_0.dll`. XP compatible builds works in ReactOS as well, but support is considered experimental.\r\n* Windows Vista users can use the XP installer or standard (non-XP) Visual Studio builds, because standard (non-XP) installer doesn't work in Vista. MinGW dropped support for XP/Vista, so install the 32-bit low-end builds from the XP compatible installer if you prefer MinGW builds.\r\n* Modern Windows users (7 and after) should use the standard (non-XP, non-lowend) builds but may try the non-standard builds if you prefer, although officially not supported.\r\n\r\n## Linux Packages (Flatpak and more)\r\nDOSBox-X is available packaged in the below formats. \r\nYou can select the one that best matches your Linux system and your needs.\r\n\r\n### Flatpak\r\nFlatpak packages are officially released for the Linux operating system (with X11 or Xwayland).\r\n\r\nThe Linux Flatpak package has the advantage of being supported by most Linux distributions, but it will run in a sandbox on your Linux system so that you may not be able to access some system-wide resources.\r\n\r\nFor the current DOSBox-X version the Linux Flatpak is available from:\r\n\r\n* [com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X.flatpakref](https://dl.flathub.org/repo/appstream/com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X.flatpakref)\r\n\r\nYou may need to install Flatpak support depending on your Linux distribution for the first time. Please see the [Quick Setup page](https://flatpak.org/setup/) for more information specific to your Linux platform. The DOSBox-X Flathub page is also available from [here](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X).\r\n\r\nOnce Flatpak support is enabled on your Linux system you can install the DOSBox-X Flatpak with the following command:\r\n\r\n``flatpak install flathub com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X``\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can install the DOSBox-X Flatpak locally if you downloaded the ``com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X.flatpakref`` file to your computer:\r\n\r\n``flatpak install --from com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X.flatpakref``\r\n\r\nAfter it is installed, it can be run with:\r\n\r\n``flatpak run com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X``\r\n\r\nBy default some system-wide resources will not be accessible by any Flatpak package.\r\nBut you can give the DOSBox-X Flatpak package additional access using the --filesystem option.\r\nFor example, to give it access to the /mnt directory:\r\n\r\n``flatpak run --filesystem=/mnt com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X``\r\n\r\nIn addition, if an earlier DOSBox-X Flatpak is already installed in the system you can update it to the current version with the command:\r\n\r\n``flatpak update com.dosbox_x.DOSBox-X``\r\n\r\nOr just ``flatpak update`` to update all installed Flatpak packages.\r\n\r\n### RPM Package\r\nRPM is a packaging format used by a variety of Linux distributions.\r\nThe current DOSBox-X version is offered via Fedora Copr here:\r\n\r\n* [Fedora Copr DOSBox-X page](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rob72/DOSBox-X/)\r\n\r\nThis supports the following Linux distributions:\r\n- Fedora Linux (current versions plus rawhide)\r\n- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 with EPEL\r\n- CentOS 8 with EPEL.\r\n\r\nUnlike a traditional package download, copr allows for the package to be automatically updated when the next release is available.\r\n\r\nIn addition, but this is not recommended, some RPM packages for older DOSBox-X version are available for CentOS in the DOSBox-X Github under Releases.\r\nSimply pick the RPM package(s) for the version you want to use for your Linux platform and install.\r\nOn CentOS, RHEL or Fedora platforms, you can install an RPM package with a command line like this:\r\n\r\n``sudo rpm -i <filename>.rpm``\r\n\r\nWhere ``<filename>`` is the main file name of the RPM package you wish to install. You may want to use the debug build if you desire to do some debugging work when running DOSBox-X. If there are missing dependencies for the rpm command, such as libpng and fluid-soundfont, then you will need to install them first. However, RPM packages are not natively supported by Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, or Linux Mint (although the ``alien`` command may sometimes help). In such case you probably want to use the Flatpak package, which works independent of your Linux distribution.\r\n\r\n### SnapCraft\r\nYou can find DOSBox-X on SnapCraft (https://snapcraft.io/dosbox-x), which maintains universal Linux packages for software including DOSBox-X.\r\nBut please note that these packages are NOT built or updated by the DOSBox-X team.\r\n\r\n### AUR Package\r\nDOSBox-X is packaged for Arch Linux, and available in the user contributed AUR Package Repository.\r\nBut please note that these packages are NOT built or updated by the DOSBox-X Team.\r\n\r\n- SDL1 build: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dosbox-x/\r\n- SDL2 build: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dosbox-x-sdl2/\r\n\r\n### DEB Package\r\nDOSBox-X is packaged for Debian, and available in the\r\n[trixie](https://packages.debian.org/trixie/dosbox-x) and\r\n[unstable](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/dosbox-x)\r\nrepositories.\r\nBut please note that these packages are NOT built or updated by the DOSBox-X Team,\r\nand that it only contains a small subset of the DOS programs provided in the Z: drive.\r\n\r\n## macOS Packages (Portable)\r\n\r\nPortable packages for the macOS (64-bit) platform are also available from the [DOSBox-X homepage](https://dosbox-x.com/).\r\n\r\nThe macOS package requires recent 64-bit Intel or ARM-based macOS (Catalina (10.15) and later). \r\nUsing the Finder app, go to the folder where the macOS zip package is downloaded, and click the zip package. Then the package will be unzipped and you will see a folder with the same name as the package. \r\nBoth SDL1 and SDL2 binaries (in .app format) are provided in the folders named ```dosbox-x``` and ```dosbox-x-sdl2``` respectively inside the zip file.\r\n\r\nYou have a choice of launching DOSBox-X by either from Launchpad, Finder, and Command-line (Terminal).\r\n\r\n### Install and launch DOSBox-X from Launchpad\r\nIn either ```dosbox-x``` or ```dosbox-x-sdl2``` folders, you can find an app named ```dosbox-x```. \r\nDrag and drop the app to the ```Applications``` folder to install DOSBox-X to Launchpad.\r\n\r\n### Launch DOSBox-X from Finder application\r\nInstead of installing DOSBox-X to Launchpad as mentioned above, you can double-click the ```dosbox-x``` app to start DOSBox-X from the Finder application. \r\n\r\n### Launch DOSBox-X from command-line (Terminal)\r\nStarting from the unzipped folder mentioned above, use ```cd``` command to go to the directory where the DOSBox-X executable is located. For SDL1 build, type ```cd dosbox-x/dosbox-x.app/Contents/MacOS```, and for SDL2 build, type ```cd dosbox-x-sdl2/dosbox-x.app/Contents/MacOS```. Run DOSBox-X with ```./dosbox-x``` and you will see the DOSBox-X window.\r\n\r\n### Initial setting of your working directory\r\nIf you see a dialog asking you to select a folder after you launch DOSBox-X, please select one which will then become your DOSBox-X working directory. You can choose to save this folder after you select one so that the folder selection dialog will no show up again next time, or let DOSBox-X show the folder selection dialog every time you run it.\r\n\r\n### Troubleshooting\r\n#### I get a dialogue stating “The app is not from the Mac App Store”\r\n\r\nYou need change your settings to allow launching apps from known developers.\r\n1. Choose Apple menu  > System Settings, then click Privacy & Security  in the sidebar. (You may need to scroll down.)\r\n2. Go to Security, then click Open.\r\n3. Click the pop-up menu next to “Allow applications from”, then choose App Store & Known Developers.\r\n5. You should see a message mentioning launching \"DOSBox-X\" was blocked. Click ```Open Anyway```.\r\n6. Enter your login password, then click OK.\r\n\r\n#### I get ```\"dosbox-x\" is damaged and can't be opened``` error\r\n  \r\nYou should be able to solve the problem by running the following command once in the Terminal.\r\n1. Using the Terminal app, go to the unzipped folder of the macOS zip package. (You should find two folders ```dosbox-x``` and ```dosbox-x-sdl2```)\r\n2. Run ``xattr -cr .``\r\n\r\n### macOS Packages (Homebrew)\r\nHomebrew provides packages for macOS Ventura and after.\r\nYou can install the package by the following steps.\r\n1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)\r\n2. In macOS Terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal) run `brew install dosbox-x`\r\n3. Launch DOSBox-X by running `dosbox-x` in macOS Terminal.\r\n\r\nPlease note that these packages are NOT built or updated by the DOSBox-X team.\r\n\r\n### macOS Packages (MacPorts)\r\n[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) provides packages for High Sierra (10.13) and after. \r\nYou can install the package by the following steps.\r\n1. [Install MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php)\r\n2. In macOS terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal) run `sudo port install dosbox-x`\r\n3. Launch DOSBox-X by running `dosbox-x` in macOS Terminal.\r\n\r\nPlease note that these packages are NOT built or updated by the DOSBox-X team.\r\n\r\n### DOSBox-X for older macOS versions\r\nOfficial portable packages for macOS versions 10.14 (Mojave) and earlier are no longer provided. Low-end builds named `DOSBox-X-macos-(version)-high-sierra.zip` were available up to [2022.09.0 (0.84.3)](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases/tag/dosbox-x-v0.84.3) for 10.12 (Sierra) and after.\r\nBinaries for macOS versions earlier than 10.12 (Sierra) have not been provided. You may try to build yourself with the help of [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/). \r\n\r\n## DOS Packages (Portable)\r\n\r\nBesides Windows, Linux and macOS packages, there are also packages released for the DOS operating system. Yes, DOSBox-X can officially run on DOS systems as well, as some DOS users seem to prefer to run DOS applications and games through a DOS emulator. With DOSBox-X running in DOS you are able to emulate another DOS system with a different PC configuration (such as different machine types, video and sound cards etc) that works better for the purpose of the users. But please note that due to the limitations of this environment not all features of DOSBox-X that are available in other platforms can be supported in the DOS version.\r\n\r\nThe HX-DOS package allows you to run DOSBox-X in a real DOS system (MS-DOS 5.0+ or compatible) with the help of the freely-available [HX DOS Extender](https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/HX), which is already included in the recent DOS release packages. Once you unzip the package you can directly type ```DOSBOX-X``` to run in DOS. See the README.TXT file inside the DOS package for more information.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can run some versions of DOSBox-X (latest is [0.83.25 2022-05-01](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases/tag/dosbox-x-v0.83.25)) from a DOS environment with the help of the free [LOADLIN](https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/linux/lnut/ch04_03.htm) program. With the LOADLIN DOS package you can run DOSBox-X right from DOSBox-X's DOS shell. Start the outside DOSBox-X with the setting ```memsize=127``` and ```cputype=pentium``` (perhaps also ```fullscreen=true``` and/or ```autolock=true```). Go to the directory where the files are extracted and type ```DOSBOX-X```. Then just wait for DOSBox-X to be automatically loaded within DOSBox-X.\r\n\r\nBoth DOS packages for the latest DOSBox-X version can be found in the [DOSBox-X homepage](https://dosbox-x.com/).\r\n\r\n## Source Code Packages (zip or tar.gz)\r\n\r\nFull source code packages of DOSBox-X are also available in both zip and tar.gz formats. Both contain the full source code, but you probably want to download the source code in zip format if you are using Windows, and the source code in tar.gz format if you are using Linux. The source code packages for the latest DOSBox-X version are available from the [DOSBox-X homepage](https://dosbox-x.com/).\r\n\r\nIf you prefer you can compile DOSBox-X from the source code by yourself. The source code packages as listed in the [Releases](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases) page contain the source code for that released version. On the other hand, if you are looking for the latest source code of DOSBox-X (including the most recent development changes in the source code), you may want to use the source code in the repository instead, or you can browse the latest source code using [Doxygen](https://dosbox-x.com/doxygen/html/index.html).\r\n\r\nYou could use either the released source code package or the latest source code according to your needs, and the source code may be compiled to run on the above-mentioned platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS and DOS) and possibly other operating systems too. Please see the [BUILD](BUILD.md) page for detailed instructions on building the DOSBox-X source code. Further descriptions of the source code can be found in the [DOSBox-X source code description](README.source-code-description) file.\r\n\r\n## Development nightly builds\r\n\r\nThe development (preview) builds intended for testing purposes for the supported platforms can be found [here](https://dosbox-x.com/devel-build.html).\r\n"

          "content": "Information about the DOSBox-X Debugger\n\nDebugger interface\n------------------\n\nIn builds where it is enabled, DOSBox-X supports breaking into the debugger\ninterface, which is shown on the console.\n\nA mapper shortcut is provided to break into the debugger on demand. Normally\nthis shortcut is set to Alt+Pause.\n\nIn Windows, DOSBox-X can create a console and show the debugger interface\non it.\n\nOn other systems including Linux and Mac OS X, DOSBox-X must be started\nfrom a terminal in order to enable the debugger.\n\nThe debugger interface should scale and respond to resizing of the\nterminal window.\n\nWARNING: Fitting to the window was added in DOSBox-X. The debugger\n         interface in DOSBox SVN requires a minimum terminal window\n         size to function, and may segfault if the terminal is too\n         small.\n\nThe debugger interface is written against the \"ncurses\" library.\n\nThe window regions of the debugger interface are:\n - Register Overview\n - Data view\n - Code Overview\n - Variable (not shown by default)\n - Output\n\nThe register window will show at all times the contents of the CPU\nregisters and segment registers as well as other important CPU\nstate.\n\nData view allows viewing the contents of memory while debugging.\nThe location shown is controlled by a segment:offset pair.\n\nIn DOSBox-X, the Data view also permits viewing data as a linear\n(pageable) offset and as a physical memory view (outside the\nCPU's paging control).\n\nThe code overview/disassembly window shows the contents of a\nmemory location as disassembled x86 instructions. Normally, this\nis set to the instruction pointer, but it can be set anywhere.\nDecoding is based on the CPU mode.\n\nThe variable list is used when the debugger is given variables\nto debug by.\n\nThe output window allows you to scroll through the last 1000\nor so log messages written from within the codebase by LOG()\nor LOG_MSG(). If the window is scrolled to the bottom, new\nmessages will appear by default.\n\nThe lowest row of the terminal is reserved for a line where\nthe user can enter debugger commands. An underscore shows\nwhere the cursor is positioned.\n\nThe code and data views have been fixed in DOSBox-X to indicate\nwhen data is not available to view for a specific segment:offset\nor linear address.\n\nIf the CPU is in protected mode, and the segment portion refers\nto a segment that does not exist, or the offset extends past\nthe limit of that segment, the code or data view will show\n'na' instead of a byte value.\n\nIf 80386 paging is enabled, and the segment:offset or linear\naddress refers to a page that is not present, then the data\nview will show 'pf' to indicate this.\n\n  na = segment does not exist, or offset exceeds segment limit\n\n  pf = segment:offset or linear address is paged out or\n       not present according to page tables.\n\nDebugging a program and breaking on start\n-----------------------------------------\n\nDOSBox-X includes a built-in command to launch a program and\nbreak at the entry point.\n\nDEBUGBOX [command] [options]\n\nYou can also type DEBUGBOX without a parameter to start the\ndebugger.\n\nDebugger keyboard shortcuts\n---------------------------\n\nTab                 Switch between windows\nF5                  Resume

Install the building environment\n\nIf you have a side install of regular Visual Studio and already set up the development environment for DOSBox-X, you can skip this step.\n\nGet and install Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#other and install the following options:\n\n\tWorkloads\n\t\tVisual C++ build tools\n\tIndividual components\n\t\tCompilers, build tools, and runtimes\n\t\t\tWindows Universal CRT SDK\n\t\tSDKs, libraries, and frameworks\n\t\t\tWindows 8.1 SDK\n\n2. Add msbuild to path environment variable\n\n - open Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017\n - type 'where msbuild' and take note of first occurrence found\n - open environment variables editor by running '%windir%\\System32\\rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables'\n - add the found path to the environment variable\n\n3. Setup VSCode build task\n\nThe default build task is 'build Windows SDL1 Debug Win32', you can switch to another in Tasks menu, Configure Default Build Task.\n\n3. Setup C/C++ extension from Microsoft\n\nSwitch to the extensions pane and install it, its identifier is ms-vscode.cpptools. When done, open the Command Palette and search for 'C/Cpp: Select a Configuration' to select the appropriate configuration for your build task.\n\n4. Setup the debugging\n\nTo change configuration, switch to the Debug pane and choose desired one in the combo box.\n\nYou can also do that from the bottom blue bar, but for some reason, VSCode does not always show it on startup; to remedy this problem execute the former procedure.\n\nYou can now build and debug DOSBox-X.\n\n5. Notes and TODO\n\nEven though it leverages existing Visual Studio solution, you do not need Visual Studio to be installed on your system, build tools are sufficient.\n\nThese instructions were written in an already set up environment, should some step be not reproducible, open an issue with the exact details so this guide can be improved.\n\nThe section about configuring IntelliSense still needs to be written.\n\n\nJoystick improvements for SDL1 build\n------------------------------------\n\nXInput is now supported through the SDL_JOYSTICK_XINPUT define, this fixes the long plaguing issue where triggers were seen as the third axis on Xbox controllers. The resulting experience was an unusable input since both triggers shared the same the axis in the default DirectInput driver provided by Microsoft, for compatibility reasons. Some might have noticed that an earlier version of the device driver did not exhibit such behavior, at the cost of breaking legacy compatibility. By enabling this flag, XInput will be used in place of DirectInput. Consequently, the third axis will be the horizontal axis of the right thumbstick and triggers will act as the fifth and sixth axes when using the 'ch' joystick type.\n\nTo enable it:\n\nset SDL1AdditionalOptions=/DSDL_JOYSTICK_XINPUT\nmsbuild dosbox-x.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=Win32\n"

As a result, axis value at rest will stay fairly stable whereas previously lot of jittering could be seen. A default value of 0.26 will do fine on contemporary gamepads (e.g. Xbox One Controller). A higher value might be needed for not so new devices as they tend to loosen over time.\n\n\nResponse\n--------\n\nSmoothing of joystick movement. Player input is smoothed using a power function, 'response' being the exponent parameter. A value of 1.0 produces a linear (unfiltered) input. A value of 3.0 produces a cubic interpolation (good for aiming). Beware though that as you increase the exponent, the produced input is less uniform overall. As exponent increases, you gain precision at center but lose precision at edges; also the overall circle shape that a linear input produces 'morphs' to a rhombus shape. Recommended range is between 1.0 and 5.0.\n\nTip 1:\nSetting a negative value will generate the opposite behavior.\n\nTip 2:\nDo not set to 0.0 as this will invariably generate a movement.\n\n\nMapper deadzones\n----------------\n\nTip 1:\nTo ensure the triggering of bi-directional command like move forward but strafe at the same time, deadzone values shall be less than ~0.7071 (the maximum possible extent when diagonally moving with a joystick with a circular restriction).\n\nTip 2:\nThe mapper deadzones are affected by 'axes mapping', this is not likely to be a problem as you are looking to emulate keyboard presses using a joystick. However, make sure to set 'axes mapping' to their default value, or simply remove them from your configuration.\n\n\nGeneral notes\n-------------\n\nYou will want to try to experiment as on what settings works best for software A and software B, and will probably end up with software-specific configurations.\n\nPlease note that most DOS software supporting joystick input will not react properly when you adjust CPU cycles while they are being run, i.e. either find the appropriate number of CPU cycles it requires first or restart it for a consistent joystick experience.\n\nDOSBox-X supports 6 buttons joysticks, to enable support, set joystick type to 4axis. You will find that 5th and 6th buttons are in fact the negative sides of the 2nd port joystick axes. To remedy this problem and use buttons instead, in the mapper add bindings to 'Axis 3 X-' and 'Axis 4 Y-' to buttons you which to act as 5th and 6th buttons on your device. Note that you can only have a single 6 buttons joystick at any time, this is due to how they are implemented (such device in fact use both joystick ports).\n"

          "content": "Information on keyboard layouts for developers\n==============================================\n\nDOSBox-X is not compatible with keyboard layouts it's not prepared for.\n\nDOSBox-X was developed around the US keyboard layout like DOSBox, mainly\ndue to limitations around the SDL1 library. SDL is responsible for input\nhandling, and SDL1 in particular only supports US keyboards.\n\nThe SDL1 library used in this source tree, unlike the official library,\ndoes not attempt to hack around the issue by forcing Windows to load\nthe US keyboard layout for itself.\n\nThis document serves as a guide to begin modifying the source code in\nthis project to add support for your keyboard layout.\n\nYou can also find a list of supported keyboard layouts and further details\nabout keyboard layouts and other regional information in the DOSBox-X Wiki:\nhttps://dosbox-x.com/wiki\n\nBelow is the source code that handles the keyboard layouts.\n\nVK_* mapping in SDL1 (Windows):\n- vs/sdl/src/video/windib/SDL_dibevents.c: DIB_InitOSKeymapPriv()\n\nDOSBox-X keyboard layout enum:\n- include/keymap.h (DKM_*) constants\n- src/gui/sdlmain.cpp KeyboardLayoutDetect(), DKM_to_string(), DKM_to_descriptive_string()\n- src/gui/sdlmain_linux.cpp (if working on Linux)\n\nYou may want to familiarize yourself with the Windows LCID for the locale\nyou'd like to add, as well as the VK_* scan codes generated by the keyboard\nfor that locale, so that SDL1 mapping can be updated properly.\n\nIn Linux, you may want to examine the X11 server keymap table and mod map\ntable and look at the X11 codes visible in the mapper to determine how\nto add support.\n\nThe SDL1 library in Windows fills a fixed array used to map VK_* keyboard\ncodes to SDLK_* scan codes. Filling in the correct SDLK_* values given the\ncurrent keyboard locale is an important first step in getting your keyboard\nlayout to work.\n\nThe general rule is to try to pick the SDLK_* code according to the unshifted\nunmodded character it would type. On US keyboards for example, the '1' key\nenters '1' unshifted and '!' shifted.\n\nIf there is no SDLK_* code for the key, modify the SDL1 header where the\nSDLK_* enumeration exists, locate the WORLD key enumerations and pick one\nnot yet already aliased, and define an alias for the new key, then return\nthat.\n\nIt is important for clean DOSBox-X development that DOSBox-X not have to\nexamine the keyboard locale within itself the meaning of the WORLD code,\nand that it can go by the new aliases of the WORLD codes to know what\nforeign key to match by.\n\nExample: WORLD_11 and WORLD_21 redefined to represent the Yen and Ro keys\n         on Japanese keyboards (see SDL_keysym.h in this source tree).\n         Those WORLD code are to be used ONLY for those keys, and not\n         anything else!\n\nNOTE:\n- To assist with scan codes and keyboard input, the mapper interface will\n  show as much extra information as practical on keyboard input.\n\n  Windows builds will show the VK_* code.\n\n  Linux builds will show the X11 keyboard code.\n\n  This information should assist with adding additional keyboard layouts.\n"

However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows. By adding official support for Windows 95, 98, ME emulation and acceleration, we hope that those old Windows games and applications could be enjoyed or used once more. Moreover, DOSBox-X adds support for DOS/V and NEC PC-98 emulations so that you can play DOS/V and PC-98 games with it.\r\n\r\nCompared with DOSBox, DOSBox-X focuses more on general emulation and accuracy. In order to help running DOS games and applications, Windows 3.x/9x/ME, as well as for the purpose of historical preservation, testing and continued DOS developments, it is our desire to implement accurate emulation, accurate enough to [help make new DOS developments possible](https://dosbox-x.com/newdosdevelopment.html) with confidence the program will run properly on actual DOS systems. DOSBox-X includes various features for different purposes (some of them ported from other projects), which are implemented as incremental changes since it was forked from DOSBox SVN Daum. DOSBox-X provides many ways to tweak and configure the DOS virtual machine, as we believe a better way to emulate the DOS platform is to give users all the options they need to emulate everything from the original IBM PC system all the way up to late 1990's configuration, whatever it takes to get your game or software package to run. Our goal is to eventually make DOSBox-X a complete emulation package that covers all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 9x based system scenarios, including peripherals, motherboards, CPUs, and all manner of hardware that was made for PC hardware of that time.\r\n\r\nPlease check out the [DOSBox-X homepage](https://dosbox-x.com) for common packages of the latest release for the supported platforms, as well as screenshots of some DOS programs and games running in DOSBox-X. Also see the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) page for DOSBox-X installation instructions and other packages, and the [Releases](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases) page for archives of all released DOSBox-X versions. For more information about DOSBox-X, such as setting up and running DOSBox-X including its usage tips, please read the user guide in the [DOSBox-X Wiki](https://dosbox-x.com/wiki). Steps for building the source code can be found in the [BUILD](BUILD.md) page.\r\n\r\nDOSBox-X is completely open-source and free of charge to use and distribute. It is released under the [GNU General Public License, version 2](COPYING). See also the [About DOSBox-X](https://dosbox-x.com/about.html) page for more information about DOSBox-X's goals and non-goals, along with some links to other projects.\r\n\r\nThis project has a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please read it for general information on contributing to or getting support from the project.\r\n\r\nBrought to you by: joncampbell123 (Jonathan Campbell)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notable features in DOSBox-X\r\n\r\nAlthough based on the DOSBox project, DOSBox-X is now a separate project because both have their own separate schedules and development priorities. For example, the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games whereas DOSBox-X goes way beyond this. At this time DOSBox-X already has a great number of features that do not exist in DOSBox. Examples of such features include:\r\n\r\n* GUI drop-down menu and built-in graphical configuration tool\r\n\r\n* Save and load state support (with up to 100 save slots + save files)\r\n\r\n* NEC PC-98, AX, DOS/V emulation and Chinese/Japanese/Korean support\r\n\r\n* Fully translatable user interfaces (with language files available)\r\n\r\n* Better support and compatibility with DOS applications\r\n\r\n* Support for more DOS commands and built-in external tools\r\n\r\n* Support for different ways to customize the internal Z: drive\r\n\r\n* Support for CPU types like Pentium Pro, II, III and MMX instructions\r\n\r\n* Support for IDE interfaces and improved Windows 3.x/9x emulation\r\n\r\n* Support for long filenames and FAT32 disk images (DOS 7+ features)\r\n\r\n* Support for pixel-perfect scaling output for improved image quality\r\n\r\n* Support for TrueType font (TTF) output for text-mode DOS programs\r\n\r\n* Support for printing features, either to a real or to a virtual printer\r\n\r\n* Support for starting programs to run on the host systems (-hostrun option)\r\n\r\n* Support for 3dfx Voodoo chip and Glide emulation (including Glide wrapper)\r\n\r\n* Support for cue sheets with FLAC, MP3, WAV, OGG Vorbis and Opus CD-DA tracks\r\n\r\n* Support for FluidSynth MIDI synthesizer (with sound fonts) and MT-32 emulation\r\n\r\n* Support for NE2000 Ethernet for networking features and modem phone book mapping\r\n\r\n* Support for features such as V-Sync, overscan border and stereo swapping\r\n\r\n* Plus many more..\r\n\r\nWhile the vast majority of features in DOSBox-X are cross-platform, DOSBox-X does also have several notable platform-dependent features, such as Direct3D output and support for automatic drive mounting on the Windows platform. These features cannot be easily ported to other platforms. More information about DOSBox-X's features can be found in [DOSBox-X’s Feature Highlights](https://dosbox-x.com/wiki/DOSBox%E2%80%90X%E2%80%99s-Feature-Highlights) page in the [DOSBox-X Wiki](https://dosbox-x.com/wiki).\r\n\r\nDOSBox-X officially supports both SDL 1.2 and SDL 2.0; both 32-bit and 64-bit builds are also supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n## DOSBox-X supported platforms and releases\r\n\r\nDOSBox-X is a cross-platform DOS emulator, so all major host operating systems are officially supported, including:\r\n\r\n1. Windows (XP or higher), 32-bit and 64-bit\r\n\r\n2. Linux (with X11), 32-bit and 64-bit\r\n\r\n3. macOS (Mac OS X), Intel and ARM-based 64-bit\r\n\r\n4. DOS (MS-DOS 5.0+ or compatible)\r\n\r\nWindows binaries (both 32-bit and 64-bit), Linux Flatpak or RPM packages (64-bit), macOS packages (64-bit) and DOS versions are officially released periodically, typically on the last day of a month or the first day of the next month. Please check out the [DOSBox-X homepage](https://dosbox-x.com) and the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) page for the latest DOSBox-X packages on these platforms and further installation instructions. You can also find ZIP packages or Windows installers for all released versions and their change logs in the [Releases](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases) page. The Window installers are intended to ease the installation process, and they allow you to start DOSBox-X as soon as the installation ends.\r\n\r\nFor running DOSBox-X in a real DOS system (MS-DOS or compatible), you can find the HX-DOS package that makes use of the freely-available [HX DOS Extender](https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/HX). Type DOSBOX-X to run it from a DOS system. There is also the DOS LOADLIN package which can run from within DOSBox-X itself in addition to a DOS system. Note, however, that not all features of DOSBox-X that are supported in other platforms can be supported in the real DOS environment.\r\n\r\nDevelopment (preview) builds intended for testing purposes for various platforms are also available from the [DOSBox-X Development Builds](https://dosbox-x.com/devel-build.html) page.\r\n\r\nThe full source code is officially provided with each DOSBox-X release, which may be compiled to run on the above and possibly other operating systems too. You can also get the latest development source code from the repository directly. See also the [BUILD](BUILD.md) page for information on building/compiling the DOSBox-X source code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compatibility with DOS programs and games\r\n\r\nWith the eventual goal of being a complete DOS emulation package that covers all pre-2000 DOS and Windows 3.x/9x based hardware scenarios, we are making efforts to ensure that the vast majority of DOS games and applications will run in DOSBox-X, and these include both text-mode and graphical-mode DOS programs. Microsoft Windows versions that are largely DOS-based (such as Windows 3.x and 9x) are officially supported by DOSBox-X as well. Note that certain config settings may need to be changed from the default ones for some of these programs to work smoothly. Take a look at the [DOSBox-X Wiki](https://dosbox-x.com/wiki) for more information.\r\n\r\nEfforts are also made to aid [continued DOS developments](https://dosbox-x.com/newdosdevelopment.html) by attempting to accurately emulate the hardware, which is why DOSBox-X used to focus on the demoscene software (especially anything prior to 1996) because that era of the MS-DOS scene tends to have all manner of weird hardware tricks, bugs, and speed-sensitive issues that make them the perfect kind of stuff to test emulation accuracy against, even more so than old DOS games. But without a doubt we are also making a lot of efforts to test DOSBox-X against other DOS games and applications, as well as PC-98 programs (most of them are games).\r\n\r\nWe add new features and make other improvements in every new DOSBox-X version, so its compatibility with DOS programs and games are also improving over time. If you have some issue with a specific DOS program or game, please feel free to post it in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing to DOSBox-X\r\n\r\nWe encourage new contributors by removing barriers to entry.\r\nIdeas and patches are always welcome, though not necessarily accepted.\r\n\r\nIf you really need that feature or change, and your changes are not\r\naccepted into this main project (or you just want to mess around with\r\nthe code), feel free to fork this project and make your changes in\r\nyour fork.\r\n\r\nAs joncampbell123 only has limited time to work on DOSBox-X, help is\r\ngreatly appreciated:\r\n\r\n  - Testing\r\n    - Features of DOSBox-X, such as its commands and functions \r\n    - The normal operation of DOS games and applications\r\n    - Windows 1.0/2.x/3.x & Windows 95/98/ME guest system support\r\n    - Software or hardware emulation accuracy, helped by for example demoscene software\r\n    - Write more unit tests to test various functions (see existing unit tests in [tests/](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/tree/master/tests))\r\n    - Developments of new DOS software (possibly aided by [DOSLIB](https://github.com/joncampbell123/doslib)/[DOSLIB2](https://github.com/joncampbell123/doslib2))\r\n  - Bug fixes, patches, improvements, refinements\r\n  - Suggestions, ideas, assistance of other users, and/or general conversation\r\n  - Platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS, DOS, but others are welcome)\r\n  - Documentation, language file translation, and software packaging\r\n  - Notes regarding DOS and Win3.x/9x games, applications, hacks or weird tricks, etc.\r\n\r\nSee the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) page for more contribution guidelines.\r\nIf you want to tweak or write some code and you don't know what to work on,\r\nfeel free to visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/issues) to get some ideas.\r\n\r\nFor more descriptions on the source code, please take a look at the\r\n[DOSBox-X source code description](README.source-code-description) page. Information on\r\nbuilding on the source code can be found in the [BUILD](BUILD.md) page.\r\n\r\nInformation about the debugger is also available in the\r\n[DOSBox-X Debugger](README.debugger) page.\r\n\r\nSee also the [CREDITS](CREDITS.md) page for crediting information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## DOSBox-X development and release pattern\r\n\r\nIn order to make DOSBox-X's development process more smooth, we have implemented a general development/release pattern for DOSBox-X. The current release pattern for DOSBox-X is as follows:\r\n\r\nNew DOSBox-X versions are made public at the start (typically on the first day) of each month, including the source code and binary releases. Then the DOSBox-X developments will be re-opened for new features, pull requests, etc. There will be no new features added 6 days before the end of the month, but only bug fixes. The last day of the month is DOSBox-X’s build day to compile for binary releases the first of the next month, so there will be no source code changes on this day including pull requests or bug fixes.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose August is the current month - August 25th will be the day pull requests will be ignored unless only bug fixes. August 31st (the last day of August) will be DOSBox-X build day.\r\n\r\nThis is DOSBox-X’s official release pattern, although it may change later.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future development experiments\r\n\r\nScattered experiments and small projects are in [experiments/](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/tree/master/experiments) as proving grounds for future revisions to DOSBox-X and its codebase.\r\n\r\nThese experiments may or may not make it into future revisions or the next version.\r\n\r\nComments are welcome on the experiments, to help improve the code overall.\r\n\r\nThere are also patches in [patch-integration/](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/tree/master/patch-integration) for possible feature integrations in the future. We have already integrated many community-developed patches into DOSBox-X in the past.\r\n\r\nSee also [General TODO.txt](docs/PLANS/General%20TODO.txt) for some plans of future DOSBox-X developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Software security comments\r\n\r\nDOSBox-X cannot claim to be a \"secure\" application. It contains a lot of\r\ncode designed for performance, not security. There may be vulnerabilities,\r\nbugs, and flaws in the emulation that could permit malicious DOS executables\r\nwithin to cause problems or exploit bugs in the emulator to cause harm.\r\nThere is no guarantee of complete containment by DOSBox-X of the guest\r\noperating system or application.\r\n\r\nIf security is a priority, then:\r\n\r\nDo not use DOSBox-X on a secure system.\r\n\r\nDo not run DOSBox-X as root or Administrator.\r\n\r\nIf you need to use DOSBox-X, run it under a lesser privileged user, in\r\na chroot jail or sandbox, or enable DOSBox-X's secure mode with its\r\ncommand-line option ``-securemode``, which disables commands that may\r\nallow access to the host system.\r\n\r\nIf your Linux distribution has it enabled, consider using the auditing\r\nsystem to limit what the DOSBox-X executable is allowed to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features that DOSBox-X is unlikely to support at this time\r\n\r\nDOSBox-X aims to be a fully-featured DOS emulation package, but there are\r\nsome things the design as implemented now cannot accommodate.\r\n\r\n* Pentium 4 or higher CPU level emulation.\r\n\r\n  DOSBox-X contains code only to emulate the 8086 through the Pentium III.\r\n  Real DOS systems (MS-DOS and compatibles) also work best with these CPUs.\r\n\r\n  If Pentium 4 or higher emulation is desired, consider using a PC\r\n  emulator like Bochs or QEMU instead. DOSBox-X may eventually develop\r\n  Pentium 4 emulation, if wanted by the DOSBox-X community in general.\r\n\r\n* Emulation of PC hardware 2001 or later.\r\n\r\n  The official cutoff for DOSBox-X is 2001, when updated \"PC 2001\"\r\n  specifications from Microsoft mandated the removal of the ISA slots\r\n  from motherboards. The focus is on implementing hardware emulation\r\n  for hardware made before that point.\r\n\r\n  Contributors are free to focus on emulating hardware within the\r\n  time frame between 1980 and 2000/2001 of their choice.\r\n\r\n* Windows guest emulation, Windows Vista or later.\r\n\r\n  DOSBox-X emulation, in terms of running Windows in DOSBox-X, will\r\n  focus primarily on Windows 1.0 through Windows ME (Millennium Edition),\r\n  and then on Windows NT through Windows XP. Windows Vista and later\r\n  versions are not a priority and will not be considered at this time.\r\n  These versions of Windows are not based on DOS.\r\n\r\n  If you need to run Windows XP and later, please consider using\r\n  QEMU, Bochs, VirtualBox, or VMware.\r\n\r\n* Any MS-DOS system other than IBM PC/XT/AT, AX, Tandy, PCjr, and PC-98.\r\n\r\n  Only the above listed systems will be considered for development\r\n  in DOSBox-X. This restriction prevents stretching of the codebase\r\n  to an unmanageable level and helps keep the code base organized.\r\n\r\n  It would be easier on myself and the open source community if\r\n  developers could focus on emulating their platform of interest in\r\n  parallel instead of putting everything into one project that,\r\n  most likely, will do a worse job overall emulating all platforms.\r\n  However, if adding emulation of the system requires only small\r\n  minimal changes, then the new system in question may be considered.\r\n\r\n  You are strongly encouraged to fork this project and implement\r\n  your own variation if you need to develop MS-DOS emulation for\r\n  any other system or console. In doing that, you gain the complete\r\n  freedom to focus on implementing the particular MS-DOS based\r\n  system of interest, and if desired, the ability to strip away\r\n  conflicting IBM PC/XT/AT emulation and unnecessary code to keep\r\n  your branch's code manageable and maintainable.\r\n\r\n  If you are starting a fork, feel free to let me know where your\r\n  fork is and what system it is emulating, so I can list it in\r\n  this README file for others seeking emulation of that system. To\r\n  help, I have added machine and video mode enumerations as \"stubs\"\r\n  to provide a starting point for your branch's implementation of\r\n  the platform. A stub implemented so far is \"FM Towns emulation\"\r\n  (```machine=fm_towns```).\r\n\r\n* Cycle-accurate timing of x86 instructions and execution.\r\n\r\n  Instructions generally run one per cycle in DOSBox-X, except for I/O\r\n  and memory access.\r\n\r\n  If accurate emulation of cycles per instruction is needed, please\r\n  consider using PCem, 86Box, or VARCem instead.\r\n\r\n* Full precision floating point emulation.\r\n\r\n  Unless using the dynamic core, DOSBox and DOSBox-X emulate the FPU\r\n  registers using the \"double\" 64-bit floating point data type.\r\n\r\n  The Intel FPU registers are 80-bit \"extended precision\" floating point\r\n  values, not 64-bit double precision, so this is effectively 12 bits of\r\n  precision loss and 5 bits of range loss (64 to 53 mantissa bits and 16\r\n  to 11 exponent bits). This slight loss of precision is perfectly fine\r\n  considering DOSBox's original goal in supporting DOS games, but may\r\n  cause problems in other cases that need the full precision.\r\n\r\n  It is known at this time that this lack of precision is enough to\r\n  cause otherwise straightforward comparisons against integers to\r\n  fail in DOS applications originally written in QBasic or Turbo Basic.\r\n  There are such DOS games written that check their file size using\r\n  a floating point compare that will fail in this manner. To run these\r\n  games, you will need to disable FPU emulation (```fpu=false```) to force\r\n  the QBasic/TurboBasic runtime to use software emulation instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Origin and history of the DOSBox-X project\r\n\r\nDOSBox-X started as a fork of the original DOSBox project sometime\r\nin mid-2011. It was started out of a desire to improve the emulator\r\nwithout having to fight with or worry about submitting patches\r\nupstream.\r\n\r\nAs its developers have made it clear, DOSBox's main focus is on\r\nDOS games. This is evident by the fact that much of the code is\r\nsomewhat accurate code with kludges to make DOS games run,\r\ninstead of focusing on the actual behaviors of real DOS systems.\r\n\r\nJonathan Campbell, the DOSBox-X project maintainer wanted to make\r\nvarious changes to the source code, but many of them were non-game\r\nrelated, and thus were unlikely to be accepted by the DOSBox developers.\r\n\r\nSince then, Jonathan Campbell has been modifying the source code over\r\ntime to improve emulation, fix bugs, and resolve incompatibilities\r\nwith Windows 95 through ME. He has added options so that DOSBox-X\r\nby default can emulate a wider variety of configurations more\r\naccurately, while allowing the user to enable various techniques or\r\nhacks if needed to run their favorite DOS games or programs. He has\r\nalso been cleaning up and organizing the code to improve stability\r\nand portability where possible.\r\n\r\nThe original DOSBox project was not written by one programmer. It\r\nhas been under development since late 2000 with patches, fixes,\r\nand improvements from members all over the Vogons forums. Despite\r\nnot having a major official release since DOSBox 0.74 over 10\r\nyears ago, the project is still in semi-active development today\r\nin the form of DOSBox SVN. Meanwhile, some of the changes themselves\r\nincorporated code from other projects.\r\n\r\nSome features and improvements in DOSBox-X also came from another\r\nbranch of DOSBox known as [DOSBox SVN Daum](http://ykhwong.x-y.net)\r\nwhich itself incorporated features from the original DOSBox\r\nproject, DOSBox-X, and many experimental patches. Although the\r\nDaum branch seems to be dead, the features borrowed from it still\r\nexists in DOSBox-X. Later on, DOSBox-X also incorporated several\r\nfeatures and improvements from other projects such as [DOSBox ECE](https://dosboxece.yesterplay.net/),\r\n[DOSBox Staging](https://dosbox-staging.github.io/), [DOSVAX](http://radioc.web.fc2.com/soflib/dosvax/dosvax.htm)/[DOSVAXJ3](https://www.nanshiki.co.jp/software/dosvaxj3.html), and [vDosPlus](http://www.vdosplus.org/).\r\n\r\nThe DOSBox-X project is also helped by its other developers and\r\ncontributors such as Wengier, aybe, Allofich, and rderooy, who have\r\ndone significant work to improve the DOSBox-X project, including\r\nadding new features, fixing bugs, creating the documentation,\r\nmaintaining the website, and porting code from other projects.\r\n\r\nSee also the [CREDITS](CREDITS.md) page for crediting of the source code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known DOSBox-X forks\r\n\r\n* DOSBox-X Emscripten port (runnable in a web browser) by Yksoft1\r\n\r\n  Significant changes are made in order to run efficiently within the web browser when compiled using LLVM/Emscripten.\r\n  These significant changes require dropping some useful features (including the menus) but are required for performance.\r\n\r\n  URL: https://github.com/yksoft1/dosbox-x-vanilla-sdl/tree/emscripten (look for clone URL and use the emscripten branch)\r\n  \r\n* DOSBox-X-App (for Windows and macOS) by emendelson\r\n\r\n  DOSBox-X-App is a slightly customized version of DOSBox-X, combined with external programs and commands that make it\r\n  easy to print and create PDFs from DOS applications. It is customized for use with applications, not games.\r\n\r\n  URL: http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/dosboxapp.html\r\n\r\n* DOSBoxWP (for WordPerfect for DOS) by emendelson\r\n\r\n  DOSBoxWP is a customized version of DOSBox-X targeted for users of WordPerfect for DOS.\r\n\r\n  URL (Windows): http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/dosboxwp.html\r\n\r\n  URL (macOS): http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/wpdosboxmac.html\r\n\r\n* Win31DOSBox (Windows 3.1 for 64-bit Windows) by emendelson\r\n\r\n  Win31DOSBox aims to be an easy method of running Windows 3.x software for 64-bit Windows systems.\r\n  The system uses a custom build of DOSBox-X when running Windows 3.1x.\r\n\r\n  URL: http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/win31dosbox.html\r\n\r\n## Support for international language translations and keyboard layouts\r\n\r\n# Translations\r\nDOSBox-X displays English as the default language, and uses the U.S. code page (437) by default, just like DOSBox.\r\n\r\nAll messages displayed by DOSBox-X are in English with the default setting. DOSBox-X does support the feature to\r\nchange the display messages with the use of language files. The language files control all visible output of the\r\ninternal commands and the internal DOS, as well as the text in DOSBox-X's drop-down menus. If you are a speaker of\r\na non-English language, you are encouraged to create additional language files for use with DOSBox-X by translating\r\nmessages in DOSBox-X to your language. Other DOSBox-X users can also use these language files for DOSBox-X to display\r\nmessages in such languages. Language files can be found in the `languages` directory of your DOSBox-X installation.\r\n\r\n|Language name|Language file|\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n|Chinese (Simplified)|[contrib/translations/zh/zh_CN.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/zh/zh_CN.lng)|\r\n|Chinese (Traditional)|[contrib/translations/zh/zh_TW.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/zh/zh_TW.lng)|\r\n|French|[contrib/translations/fr/fr_FR.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/fr/fr_FR.lng)|\r\n|German|[contrib/translations/de/de_DE.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/de/de_DE.lng)|\r\n|Italian|[contrib/translations/it/it_IT.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/it/it_IT.lng)|\r\n|Japanese|[contrib/translations/ja/ja_JP.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/ja/ja_JP.lng)|\r\n|Korean|[contrib/translations/ko/ko_KR.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/ko/ko_KR.lng)|\r\n|Portuguese (Brazilian)|[contrib/translations/pt/pt_BR.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/pt/pt_BR.lng)|\r\n|Spanish|[contrib/translations/es/es_ES.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/es/es_ES.lng)|\r\n|Turkish|[contrib/translations/tr/tr_TR.lng](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/master/contrib/translations/tr/tr_TR.lng)|\r\n\r\n# Keyboard layouts\r\nThe fact that DOSBox-X was developed around the U.S. keyboard layout is primarily due to limitations around the SDL1\r\nlibrary which provides input handling. As such when using the SDL1 version and a non-US keyboard, DOSBox-X automatically\r\nuses scancodes with the default setting to work around keyboard layout issues. Scancodes are not needed when using\r\nnon-US keyboard layouts in the SDL2 version. If you find that a keyboard layout is not yet supported by DOSBox-X,\r\nin order to add additional layouts for use with DOSBox-X, please see file [README.keyboard-layout-handling](README.keyboard-layout-handling)\r\non how to do so as a developer.\r\n\r\nFor further information on international support and regional settings of DOSBox-X, such as steps to create DOSBox-X\r\nlanguage files or use external keyboard files in DOSBox-X, as well as support for the Euro symbol and country-specific\r\ndate and time formats, please look at the guide [Regional settings in DOSBox-X](https://dosbox-x.com/wiki/Guide%3ARegional-settings-in-DOSBox%E2%80%90X) in the [DOSBox-X Wiki](https://dosbox-x.com/wiki).

Each\nsetting can be defined as an int, hexadecimal,\nstring, double, and multivalue item. Read\ninclude/setup.h and src/misc/setup.cpp for more\ninformation.\n\nThere is one section (the autoexec section) that\nis defined as lines of text.\n\nIn the original DOSBox SVN project, each section\nalso has an init and destructor function. The\ncodebase in SVN is heavily written around emulator\nsetup from each section, which is why the order\nof the sections is important. DOSBox-X eliminated\nthese init and destructor functions and encourages\ninitial setup from functions called in main(),\nand additional setup/teardown through VM event\ncallbacks (see include/setup.h). A callback\nmechanism is provided however (at a section level)\nwhen settings change.\n\nMost of the code in this codebase assumes that\nit can retrieve a section by name, and a setting\nby name, without checking whether the returned\nreferce to a setting is NULL. Therefore, removing\na setting or referring to settings before the\ncreation of them can cause this code to crash\nuntil that reference is removed.\n\nWarnings regarding C integer types\n----------------------------------\n\nContrary to initial assumptions, never assume that int and long have specific\nsizes. Even long long.\n\nThe general assumption is that int is 32 bit and long is 32 bit.\nThat is not always true, and that can get you in trouble when\nworking on this or other projects.\n\nAnother common problem is the use of integers for pointer manipulation.\nStoring pointers or computing differences between pointers may happen\nto work on 32-bit, where ints and pointers are the same size, but the\nsame code may break on 64-bit.\n\nTherefore, for manipulating pointers, use uintptr_t instead of int or\nlong.\n\nFor quick reference, here is a breakdown of the development\ntargets and their sizes:\n\nWindows (Microsoft C++) 32-bit:\n  sizeof(int) == 32-bit\n  sizeof(long) == 32-bit\n  sizeof(long long) == 64-bit\n  sizeof(uintptr_t) == 32-bit\n\nWindows (Microsoft C++) 64-bit:\n  sizeof(int) == 32-bit\n  sizeof(long) == 32-bit\n  sizeof(long long) == 64-bit\n  sizeof(uintptr_t) == 64-bit\n\nNOTE: If you ever intend to compile against older versions of Microsoft C++/Visual Studio,\n      the \"long long\" type will need to be replaced by __int64.\n\nLinux 32-bit:\n  sizeof(int) == 32-bit\n  sizeof(long) == 32-bit\n  sizeof(long long) == 64-bit\n  sizeof(uintptr_t) == 32-bit\n\nLinux 64-bit:\n  sizeof(int) == 32-bit\n  sizeof(long) == 64-bit\n  sizeof(long long) == 64-bit\n  sizeof(uintptr_t) == 64-bit\n\n\nThis code is written to assume that sizeof(int) >= 32-bit.\nHowever know that there are platforms where sizeof(int) is\neven smaller. In real-mode MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows for\nexample, sizeof(int) == 16 bits (2 bytes). DOSBox-X will\nnot target 16-bit DOS and Windows, so this is not a problem\nso far.\n\nFor obvious reasons, far pointers are not supported. The\nmemory map of the runtime environment is assumed to be\nflat with possible virtual memory and paging.\n\nWhen working on this code, please understand the limits of\nthe integer type in the code you are writing to avoid\nproblems. Pick a data type that is large enough for the\nexpected range of input.\n\nIt is suggested to use C header constants if possible\nfor min and max integer values, like UINT_MAX.\n\nIf the code needs to operate with specific widths of\ninteger, please use data types like uint16_t, uint32_t,\nint16_t and int32_t provided by modern C libraries, and\ndo not assume the width of int and long.\n\nIf compiling with older versions of Visual Studio, you will\nneed to include a header file to provide the uintptr_t and\nuint32_t datatypes to fill in what is lacking in the C library.\n\nWhen multiplying integers, overflow cases can be avoided\nwith a * b by rejecting the operation if b > (UINT_MAX / a)\nor by multiplying a * b with a and b typecast to the next\nlargest datatype.\n\nRemember that signed and unsigned integers have the same\nwidth but the MSB changes the interpretation. This code\nis written for processors (such as x86) where signed integers\nare 2's complement. It will not work correctly with any\nother type of signed integer.\n\n2's complement means that the MSB bit of an integer indicates\nthe number is negative. When it is negative, the value could\nbe thought of as N - (2^sizeof_in_bits(int)). For a 16-bit\nsigned integer:\n\n   2^16 = 0x10000 = 65536\n\n     hex         int    unsigned int        equiv\n   0x7FFE       32766       32766           32766 - 0\n   0x7FFF       32767       32767           32767 - 0\n   0x8000      -32768       32768           32768 - 65536\n   0x8001      -32767       32769           32769 - 65536\n   ...\n   0xFFFE      -2           65534           65534 - 65536\n   0xFFFF      -1           65535           65535 - 65536\n   (carry, overflow all 16-bits, roll back to 0)\n   0x0000       0           0               0 - 0\n   0x0001       1           1               1 - 0\n\nAnother possible problem may lie in using negation (-) or\ninverting all bits (~) of an integer for masking. The\nresult may be treated by the compiler as an integer. Make\nsure to typecast it to clarify.\n\nAnother possible incompatibility lies with printf() and\nlong long integers.\n\nAlways typecast the printf() parameters to the data type\nintended to avoid problems and warnings.\n\nWhile macOS and Linux have runtimes that can take %llu\nor %llx, Microsoft's runtime in Windows cannot. Either\navoid printing long long integers or add conditional code\nto use %llx or %llx on Linux and %I64u or %I64d on Windows.\n\nNote that MinGW compilation on Windows suffers from the\nsame limitation due to use of Microsoft C runtime.\n\nWhen dealing with sizes, including file I/O and byte counts,\nuse size_t (unsigned value) and ssize_t (signed value) instead.\nThis will help with using the C++ standard template library\nand the C file I/O library. If compiling for a target where\nread and write use int for a return value instead, then\nuse typecasting.\n\nWhen handling file offsets, use off_t instead of long.\nModern C runtime versions of lseek and tell will use that\ndatatype. For older runtimes that use \"long\", make a typecast\nin a header file for your target to declare off_t. Remember\nthat off_t is a signed value and that it can be negative.\n\nMake sure to use the 64-bit version of lseek (often named\nlseek64 or _lseeki64) in order to support files 4GB or\nlarger if allowed by the runtime environment.\n\nOn most modern runtimes, an alternate version of open()\nmay be required in order to open or create files larger\nthan 2GB. However the alternate open() reference can be\neliminated in certain cases.\n\nOn 32-bit Linux, direct calls to open64() can be avoided\nif CFLAGS contains -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 or\n#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 is added to the project.\n\nRemember that lseek() can return -1 to indicate an error.\nlseek() however will permit seeking past the end of a file.\n\nwriting at that point will extend the file to allow the\nfile write to occur at that offset. Depending on the platform,\nthat will either cause a sparse file (Linux + ext) or will\ncause a loop within the filesystem driver to extend the file\nand zero clusters to make it happen (Windows XP through 10).\n\nUse of the FILE* file I/O layer is OK, but not recommended\nunless there is a need to use text parsing with functions\nlike fgets() or fprintf(). For other uses, please use C\nfunctions open, close, read, write, lseek and learn to use\nfile handles.\n\nUnderstand that when fgets() returns with the buffer filled\nwith the line of text, the end of the string will always include\nthe newline (\\n) that fgets() stopped reading at.\n\nIf fopen() was called with the \"b\" flag on DOS and Windows\nformatted text files, the end of the string will probably\ncontain \\r\\n (CR LF). On platforms other than DOS and Windows,\n\\r\\n will always appear if it is in the file.\n\nC file handles are signed integers. They can be negative.\nFile handles returned by the C runtime however are never\nnegative except to indicate an error.\n\nA good way to track whether an int holds an open file therefore,\nis to initialize at startup that integer to -1, and then when\nopen succeeds, assign that value the file handle. When closing\nthe file, assign -1 to the integer to record that the handle was\nclosed.\n\nOther parts of the code can also check if the file handle is\nnon-negative before operating on the file as a safety measure\nagainst calling that function when the file was never opened.\n\nOn Windows, the HANDLE value at the Win32 API level can be obtained\nfrom an integer file handle using _get_osfhandle() for use with\nthe Win32 API functions directly.\n\nWhen using open(), make sure to use O_BINARY to avoid\nCR/LF translation on DOS and Windows systems. Make sure\nthere is a header that defines O_BINARY as (0) if the\nplatform does not provide O_BINARY to avoid #ifdef's\naround each open() call.\n\nWhen using arithmetic with C pointers and integers,\nunderstand that the pointer is adjusted by the value of the\ninteger times the size of the pointer type. If you intend\nto adjust by bytes, then typecast the pointer to char* or\nunsigned char* first, or typecast to uintptr_t to operate\non the pointer value as if an integer, then add the integer\nvalue to the pointer.\n\nAt the lowest level, a pointer could be thought of as an\ninteger that is interpreted by the CPU as a memory address\nto operate on, rather than an integer value directly.\n\nTherefore, when adding an integer to a pointer value, the\nresult could be thought of as:\n\n  (new pointer value in bytes) = (current pointer value in bytes) + integer value * sizeof(pointer data type)\n\nIf the pointer is char, then adding 4 will advance by 4 bytes.\nIf the pointer is int, then adding 4 will advance by 4 * sizeof(int) bytes, or, 4 memory locations of type int.\n\nKeep this in mind when manipulating pointers while working\non this code.\n\nTime and cycles in DOSBox-X\n---------------------------\n\nTime is handled as a macro unit of 1ms time called \"ticks\",\ntied heavily to SDL_GetTicks() to track time.\n\nWithin each 1ms tick, a cycle count specified by the user\nis executed as CPU time.\n\nSetting cycles=3000 therefore, instructs DOSBox and DOSBox-X\nto execute 3000 CPU cycles per millisecond. That generally\nmeans (though not always) that 3000 instructions are executed\nper millisecond.\n\nOther parts of emulation may consume additional CPU cycles\nto simulate I/O or video RAM delay.\n\nNormal_Loop() in src/dosbox.cpp controls per-tick execution\nas directed by PIC_RunQueue() whether or not the 1ms tick\nhas completed.\n\nGenerally the CPU core will execute instructions for the\nentire 1ms tick, but the loop will cut short if events\nare scheduled to execute sooner.\n\nEvents are scheduled in src/hardware/timer.cpp, using\nPIC_AddEvent() given a callback and a delay in milliseconds.\nScheduling an event will cut the CPU cycle count back to\nenable the event to execute on time.\n\nPIC_AddEvent() events are scheduled once. Periodic events\nshould call PIC_AddEvent() again within the callback. For\nprecision reasons, PIC_AddEvent() can identify whether it\nis being called from an event callback, and it will use\nthe delta time differently to help periodic events maintain\nregular intervals.\n\nEvents can be removed using PIC_RemoveEvents().\n\nPer-tick event handlers can be added using the\nTIMER_AddTickHandler() function in src/hardware/pic.cpp.\nThe callback will be called at the completion of the\n1ms tick.\n\nEmulator code can query emulator time at any time\nusing the functions in include/pic.h.\n\nPIC_TickIndex() returns the time within the 1ms\ntick as a floating point value from 0.0 to 1.0.\n\nPIC_TickIndexND() returns the same as cycle counts\nwithin the 1ms tick.\n\nPIC_FullIndex() returns absolute emulator time\nby combining ticks and cycle count time.\n\n\nHow DOSBox and DOSBox-X mix x86 and native code\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nMuch of the DOS and BIOS handling in DOSBox and DOSBox-X\nis done through the use of the \"callback\" instruction\nand a callback system in src/cpu/callback.cpp.\n\nEach BIOS interrupt is a callback, as is the DOS kernel\ninterrupts. INT 21h is handled as a callback to src/dos/dos.cpp\nfunction DOS21_Handler(), for example. That native code\nfunction can then manipulate CPU registers and memory as\nneeded to emulate the DOS call.\n\nSome callback functions will also modify the stack frame\nto set or clear specific CPU flags on return, using\nfunctions CALLBACK_SCF(), CALLBACK_SZF(), and CALLBACK_SIF().\n\nThe callback instruction is 0xFE 0x38 <uint16_t>. This\nis an invalid opcode on actual x86 hardware, but it is\na call into a callback function within the DOSBox\nemulation. The uint16_t value specifies which callback.\n\nCallbacks are registered through CALLBACK_Allocate(),\nwhich then returns an integer value that is an index into\nthe callback table. 0 is an invalid callback value that\nindicates no callback was allocated, though at this time,\nCALLBACK_Allocate() is written to E_Exit() and abort\nemulation in the case that none are available, instead\nof returning zero.\n\nCALLBACK_DeAllocate() can be used with the index to\nfree that slot so that other code can use CALLBACK_Allocate()\nto take that slot if needed, though it is rare to use\nCALLBACK_DeAllocate() so far.\n\nWhen allocated, the emulation code can then write x86\ninstructions where needed that include the callback\ninstruction in order to work from native code at that\npoint in execution. Generally, most of the x86 code\ngeneration is done within the callback framework itself\nusing CALLBACK_SetupExtra to write common patterns of\nx86 code depending on how the native code is meant to\nexecute or return to the caller.\n\nWhen the CPU core encounters a callback instruction,\nthe index of the instruction (nonzero, remember) is\nreturned from the execution loop with the expectation\nthe caller will then index the callback array with it.\n\nIf the callback instruction is called from protected\nmode, memory and I/O access may cause recursion of\nthe emulator. Memory access functions called by the\nnative code may trigger an I/O port or page fault\nexception within the guest. DOSBox and DOSBox-X\nresolve the fault by pushing an exception frame\nonto the stack and then recursing into another\nemulation loop which does not break until the fault\nis resolved. While this is perfectly fine for\nDOS and Windows 3.1 simple fault handling, this\nmay cause recursion issues with more advanced\ntask switching and fault handling in Windows 95\nand later.\n\nThe most common reason a callback handler might\nget caught with a page fault is the emulation\nof DOS and BIOS interrupts while running within\nthe virtualization environment of Windows 3.0\nthrough Windows ME.\n\nAnother possible source of page faults may occur\nwith DOS extenders that enable paging of memory\nto disk.\n\nCallback functions will typically return CBRET_NONE.\n\nDOSBox-X menu framework\n-----------------------\n\nInstead of using a specific menu system directly, DOSBox-X uses a menu\nframework as defined in include/menu.h and src/gui/menu.cpp.\n\nThis menu framework allows using the same menu item and menu layout\non all supported targets.\n\nPrior to the framework, DOSBox-X menus were exclusively for Windows only\nand defined in an *.rc file.\n\nThe design of the system is that all components of the emulator define\nand register their menu items during init by a specific name. Mapper\nshortcuts automatically register a menu item named \"mapper_\" + mapper\nshortcut name.\n\nPopup menus are also menu items by name, controlled by src/gui/menu.cpp.\n\nThe final layout is controlled by src/gui/menu.cpp which refers to\nmenu items by name and the order that they are arranged in.\n\nThe final layout can be seen through the display list in the menu object\nand the display list in each menu item that was created as a submenu.\nThe display list contains the exact order that menu items are arranged.\n\nIn the SDL drawn menus, each menu item also contains the screen and\nrelative coordinates that were decided on when the menu object was last\ncalled to rebuild or arrange the menus.\n\nThe SDL drawn menus are the only type that requires the main DOSBox-X\nevent loop to process menu events on their behalf including drawing and\nreacting to mouse/touchscreen input. Windows and macOS menus do not\nrequire the main event loop's attention except when the user selects an\nitem.\n\nAccess to the menu items is by name, as well. get_item() returns a menu\nitem by reference, which itself contains methods to control the state\nof the menu item and to reflect the changes to the menu framework.\n\nMenu item methods return a reference to themselves to permit chaining\nthe calls on one line to keep visual clutter to a minimum.\n\nThe menu framework will call E_Exit() if the menu item by name does\nnot exist. Another method exists in the menu object to test if an\nitem exists by name.\n\nIt is expected that references returned from get_item() are used\nshort-term and never held onto for longer than needed. References\npoint directly to a vector within the menu object that can become\ninvalid if anything is done to cause the vector to resize. Always\ncall get_item() for a menu item to operate on it, never cache or\nstore the return value. Never add items while holding a reference.\n\nMixer audio framework\n---------------------\n\nAudio is rendered from all sources once a millisecond (once per tick).\n\nAudio is rendered to 16-bit stereo at the sample rate of the user's\nchoice (in dosbox-x.conf).\n\nAudio may be rendered within the 1ms tick at any point if code calls\nthe MIXER_FillUp() function or FillUp() member of a mixer channel.\nTypically that is done when a significant state change is made to\nan audio source in order to render accurately while not rendering\nonce per sample in an inefficient manner.\n\nIt is important to note that when a significant state change happens,\nthe device calls FillUp() first to render audio UP TO THAT POINT,\nthen applies the state change.\n\nWhen the 1ms tick is completed, the audio is filled out to 1ms\nand then sent off to a circular buffer where it can be picked up\nand sent to the sound card when the Simple Directmedia Library\ncalls to pick it up.\n\nIn DOSBox-X, the mixer is written to render exactly 1ms at the\nsample rate per 1ms of emulator time. Fractional integer math\nis carried out in src/hardware/mixer.cpp to ensure the exact\nnumber of samples is rendered.\n\nAudio is rendered down to a common mixer buffer that is at least\n16384 samples large.\n\nThe mixer channel specifies the sample rate of the source, so that\nthe mixer can upsample properly. The source format is determined\nat the time of writing to the mixer channel. The source is free\nto change from 8/16-bit PCM mono/stereo at any time.\n\nIn DOSBox-X, there is additional framework provided to emulate\nanalog properties and DAC characteristics through lowpass filters\nand rate vs slew rate interpolation.\n\nNormally, the source does not specify a lowpass filter nor does\nit provide a slew rate. In that case, normal linear interpolation\nis applied on upsample.\n\nIf the source provides a slew rate, the slew rate is used for\nlinear interpolation. If the slew rate is higher than the sample\nrate, then the interpolation within the sample completes faster.\nIf the slew rate is lower than the sample rate, the interpolation\nwill be done too slow to complete fully before the next sample.\n\nThe reason for slew rate rendering is simple. DACs without filters\nchange instantaneously between samples. This is what gives older\nsound cards (including the older Sound Blaster cards) their grungy\nmetallic characteristic. Sound cards since then filter the audio\nafter the DAC (or filter as part of DAC output) to smooth\ntransitions between samples to improve sound quality for low sample\nrates.\n\nHowever, as anyone knows in the analog domain, transistors do not\nactually change instantaneously. There is a transition period from\nON to OFF, and OFF to ON, however fast it is. The slew rate parameter\nspecifies the \"sample rate\" that defines the transition period.\nThe higher the slew rate, the faster the transition.\n\nThe lowpass filter is there to simulate the analog filtering post\nDAC. In most cases, a sound card could be thought of as a DAC with\nor without DAC interpolation, put through an audio amplifier\ncircuit that can only amplify and pass up to about 20KHz.\n\nSound Blaster 1.0/2.0 emulation in DOSBox-X for example is written\nto simulate a DAC with a slew rate of 16-20KHz and a lowpass filter\nof 20KHz, to simulate the grungy metallic flavor of the sound.\n\nSound Blaster Pro adds to the setup by using the lowpass parameter\naccording to the \"filter bit\" in the mixer registers.\n\nSound Blaster 16 and ESS emulation simulates the newer DACs using\nnormal linear interpolation and the lowpass filter according to\nthe source rate.\n\nWithin the mixer framework, audio routing is provided to render\nto a WAV file if instructed by the user, and to the audio track\nof an AVI file if also instructed by the user.\n\nIn DOSBox-X, individual audio channels from each source are also\nrecorded to an AVI file that has one audio track per channel, to\nallow recording each channel individually. The intent of this\nsetup is to enable editing audio and video from a DOS game with\nthe ability to selectively disable unrelated audio or extract\ngame music without the sound effects in ways appropriate for\nvideo production.\n\nIn DOSBox SVN, audio rendering is driven by the SDL audio device,\nwhich may (usually) or may not drift slightly from emulation.\n\nIn DOSBox-X, audio rendering is tied to emulation time, and\naudio/video sync will never drift in a captured AVI file.\n\nIn DOSBox-X, if compiled against FFMPEG, the captured audio may\nbe sent instead to the AAC codec and muxed into an MPEG transport\nstream as part of video capture.\n\nA device creates a mixer channel by calling MIXER_AddChannel()\nto create another audio channel. The function will return a pointer\nto a mixer channel object which can then be directed to start,\nstop, and render audio. The function will also call the callback\nhandler function given at creation time when audio rendering is\nneeded.\n\nWhen a device is finished with the channel, it should call\nMIXER_DelChannel() to destroy the channel.\n\nMixer channel enumeration is possible with MIXER_FirstChannel()\nor MIXER_FindChannel(). Mixer channels are linked together in\na singly linked list when active.\n\nsrc/hardware/mixer.cpp also registers a .COM program on\ndrive Z: that can be used to list mixer channels and control\nmixer volume.\n\nSound Blaster emulation\n-----------------------\n\nsrc/hardware/sblaster.cpp emulates all models of Sound Blaster\nfrom Sound Blaster 1.0 through Sound Blaster 16. In DOSBox-X,\nadditional code was added to emulate the ESS688 and SC400\ncards as well.\n\nThe code is written to be as accurate as possible about\nthe state and function of Sound Blaster cards, including many\nundocumented quirks.\n\nAdditional hacks were added for additional tricks that some\nold DOS games and demos use. One such hack is \"goldplay\" mode,\nreferring to an old music tracker playback library that\nsupported playing MOD files to LPT DAC, PC speaker, and\nSound Blaster. The reason a hack was added is due to the\nway this library renders single-sample output via DMA.\nInstead of normal DMA, the library allocates a 1-sample\nbuffer and instructs the DMA controller to loop over the\nsingle sample. The timer interrupt then overwrites the\n1-sample buffer at the sample rate it believes is the\nbest to render at.\n\nIn DOSBox SVN, sample rates are not capped.\n\nIn DOSBox-X, sample rates are capped according to the\nbehavior of the actual hardware. That includes the 23KHz\ncap for non-highspeed and 45KHz cap for highspeed DSP\nplayback.\n\nThe emulation is written in a fairly straightforward way\nthat should be easy to modify if needed. DSP commands are\ncollected into a buffer according to a table that indicates\nhow long each command is from the first byte.\n\nA buffer is used to return DSP bytes read back from the\nsound card.\n\nUnless otherwise asked, the Sound Blaster code will also\nregister I/O handlers for and initialize OPL2/OPL3 FM\nemulation at port 0x388. The code may initialize Game\nBlaster compatible CMS emulation as well.\n\nOn DOS kernel initialization, the Sound Blaster emulation\nwill also automatically create the BLASTER environment\nvariable. This environment variable is used by many DOS\ngames to find the sound card. Some games require it,\nwhile others will probe manually for the sound card.\n\nVGA emulation\n-------------\n\nThe VGA emulation written in DOSBox-X is written in two\nparts.\n\nThe first part concerns IBM PC/XT/AT emulation and VGA\nemulation, with adjustments for some SVGA chipsets and\nfor MDA/Hercules/Tandy/EGA as well.\n\nThe second part concerns NEC PC-98 and emulation of its\nsubsystem.\n\nThe two parts work somewhat independently. Which one\nbecomes active depends on the machine= setting, whether\nit enables IBM PC or NEC PC-98 emulation.\n\nAll VGA emulation is tied to a VGA state structure that\nis globally visible in the code. The state stores in the\nstructure exactly or closely mirrors the values written\nto the registers. Extended state is either carried in\nthe same registers or stored in other values. Extended\nstate is generally stored and represented as if emulating\nthe S3 chipset. Some fields are either extended or\nstored separately when holding Tandy/PCjr state.\n\nAll PC-98 emulation is tied to the GDC controller emulation\nstate of both GDCs (master and slave). VGA state is not\nused much in PC-98 mode.\n\nSupport is not implemented for oddball PC-98 GDC state such\nas programming the master and slave GDCs to run out of\nsync with each other. Custom modes are supported however,\nsuch as the custom video timing used in Ishtar.\n\nVGA state is determined by the register contents (low level)\ninstead of INT 10h mode (high level). The register contents\nare used to select a mode enumeration which affects the\nway video memory is rendered. The modes are the M_*\nenumeration constants defined in include/vga.h.\n\n    M_CGA2          CGA 1bpp 2-color mode (e.g. 640x200)\n    M_CGA4          CGA 2bpp 4-color mode (e.g. 320x200)\n    M_EGA           EGA/VGA 4bpp 16-color planar modes\n    M_VGA           VGA 8bpp 256-color modes, usually chained planar, or highcolor DAC output\n    M_LIN4          SVGA 4bpp 16-color planar modes\n    M_LIN8          SVGA 8bpp 256-color modes (linear)\n    M_LIN15         SVGA 16bpp highcolor modes (15bpp 5:5:5 RGB = XRRRRRGGGGGBBBBB)\n    M_LIN16         SVGA 16bpp highcolor modes (16bpp 5:6:5 RGB = RRRRRGGGGGGBBBBB)\n    M_LIN24         SVGA 24bpp truecolor modes (24bpp 8:8:8 RGB)\n    M_LIN32         SVGA 32bpp truecolor modes (32bpp 8:8:8:8 ARGB)\n    M_TEXT          Alphanumeric text modes (CGA/EGA/VGA/SVGA/Tandy/PCjr)\n    M_HERC_GFX      Hercules 1bpp 2-color mode (usually 720x348)\n    M_HERC_TEXT     MDA/Hercules alphanumeric text mode\n    M_CGA16         CGA composite video emulation\n    M_TANDY2        Tandy/PCjr 1bpp 2-color mode\n    M_TANDY4        Tandy/PCjr 2bpp 4-color mode\n    M_TANDY16       Tandy/PCjr 4bpp 16-color mode\n    M_TANDY_TEXT    Tandy/PCjr text mode\n    M_AMSTRAD       Amstrad 4bpp 16-color mode\n    M_PC98          NEC PC-98 text/graphics output (combined)\n    M_FM_TOWNS      Stub for FM Towns\n\n    NOTICE: A string array is also defined for private use of the\n            VGA_SetupDrawing() function for each M_ constant.\n            If you add a new constant, you must add a string\n            for that constant in src/hardware/vga_draw.cpp,\n            or else DOSBox-X may segfault when announcing the\n            video mode on mode change.\n\n            The order of the enumeration MUST match the strings.\n\n            The string array is defined (at the time of writing\n            this documentation) at line 2755 of\n            src/hardware/vga_draw.cpp.\n\nVGA drawing setup is initialized using the VGA_SetupDrawing()\nfunction in src/hardware/vga_draw.cpp. The function uses\nmachine type, VGA mode, and register state to determine the\nactive display area (used to size DOSBox's window) and\nrefresh rate.\n\nDOSBox SVN will generally render the VGA display in quarters\nof the screen, except when machine=vgaonly, where it will\nrender one line at a time.\n\nDOSBox-X will always render one line at a time, in all video\nmodes.\n\nRendering one line at a time may be required if the DOS\ngame in question uses raster or palette effects that require\nscanline precision. \"Copper\" effects in the demoscene, such\nas the act of changing color palette entries per scanline to\nproduce moving bars of color, require per-line rendering to\nappear correctly.\n\nNOTE: To better understand the term \"copper effects\", read\n      the following links describing the original\n      Commodore Amiga video hardware:\n\n      https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=21866\n      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Chip_Set#Copper\n\nPIC events are used in the VGA code to trigger rendering\na scanline at the interval determined by the horizontal\nsync rate. Some additional events are used for horizontal\nblank, sync, and return to active display. The VGA system\nis set up so that these events set up continuous rasterization\nof the display.\n\nIf for any reason, these events should stop, the display\nin the emulator window will stop updating.\n\nRendering of VGA memory per scanline is carried out using\na function pointer to a function assigned by the last\ncall to VGA_SetupDrawing(). At call time, the function\nis expected to render to a buffer and return the pixel\ndata as the return value. In most cases, that is done\nby rendering to a specific temporary buffer set aside\nfor rasterizing, and then returning any number of bytes\n(0 to 31) from the start of the buffer. VGA text rendering\nmay return 0 to 8 pixels from the start depending on the\nhorizontal panning (hpel) register state for example.\n\nPer-scanline rendering is handled by PIC event\nVGA_DrawSingleLine() which calls the render function\nand manages VGA state as it advances through the\nscan lines and addresses in memory.\n\nVertical retrace is handled by PIC event\nVGA_VerticalTimer().\n\nEmulation of a vertical retrace interrupt is handled by\nPIC event VGA_VertInterrupt. This event has code to\nemulate the IRQ 2/9 interrupt of EGA and the IRQ 2\nvsync interrupt in PC-98 mode.\n\nIt is known that some double-buffered VGA registers\ntake effect some time between blanking at the end of\nthe active display, and active display at the start.\nWhenever that happens the PIC event function\nVGA_DisplayStartLatch() is set up to emulate the\ntransfer of those registers.\n\nDOSBox SVN will generally render per scanline in\nvideo memory, using the scaler to double the scanline\nif appropriate. machine=vgaonly however may override\nthat.\n\nDOSBox-X will generally render all scanlines that\nwould be sent to a CRT, meaning that 200-line modes\nare doubled, by default for accuracy. This can be\ndisabled by setting doublescan=false to get DOSBox\nSVN behavior.\n\nThe reason it matters is that the doublescan\nbehavior prevents the advanced scalers (such as 2xsai)\nfrom working. To enable these scalers, turn off\nthe doublescan mode.\n\nVGA memory size and allocation is handled in\nsrc/hardware/vga_memory.cpp. VGA memory is mapped\nto the appropriate memory ranges depending on\nregister state, machine type, and video mode in\nVGA_SetupHandlers(). Register-level emulation of\ncertain registers will call VGA_SetupHandlers()\nif it might or will affect how VGA memory is\nmapped.\n\nVGA_SetupHandlers() also determines the callback\nhandler used to respond to video memory access\nfrom the CPU. Register state and hardware state\ndetermine how the video hardware handles read\nand write operations, this is where it's handled.\n\nIn the simplest case, VGA_SetupHandlers() will\nemulate straightforward memory access for\nMDA/CGA/Hercules text and graphics modes. No\nadvanced logic is involved, video RAM behaves\nlike normal RAM.\n\nIn the more complex cases, especially EGA/VGA,\na handler is set up to accept reads and writes\nand route it through the read/write modes that\ndetermine how it's handled across the planar\nmemory of the EGA/VGA hardware.\n\nIn PC-98 mode, the memory handler accepts\nread/write to text and character RAM,\nnon-volatile RAM, and maps read/write operations\nto graphics RAM through the state of the EGC\nhardware.\n\nThere is separate code for S3 emulation to map\na linear framebuffer to an extended memory\naddress (currently 0xE0000000) defined in\nsrc/hardware/memory.cpp. VESA BIOS emulation\ninvolving linear framebuffer modes rely on\nS3 emulation to provide them. There are registers\nemulated by src/hardware/vga_s3.cpp that\nindirectly control the linear framebuffer.\n\nIn DOSBox SVN, the linear framebuffer is\nhandled directly by the MEM_GetPageHandler()\nfunction.\n\nIn DOSBox-X, the linear framebuffer is given\nusing the memory callout system when reads\nand writes are issued to that range for the\nfirst time.\n\nNote that the linear framebuffer handler also\nincludes the memory-mapped I/O registers also\nprovided by S3 chipsets.\n\nVGA memory handlers, just like any other\nmemory handler, must translate the given address\nto the physical address before handling.\n\nFor some strange reason, DOSBox SVN page\nmapping calls the memory handler with the CPU's\nvirtual memory address. This behavior was\ninherited by DOSBox-X when forked from DOSBox SVN.\n\nConvert the virtual address to physical using\nthe PAGING_GetPhysicalAddress() function before\nusing it in video RAM emulation.\n\nThe memory handler C++ base class is written\nso that there are methods for getting a host\npointer or handling memory read/write as\na byte, word, or dword.\n\nA memory handler object can simplify code by\nimplementing only the byte handler, and letting\nthe C++ base class break word and dword I/O\ndown to byte access. Memory handlers can\nimplement their own word/dword handlers if\nthe device requires different handling for\nlarger than byte sized I/O, or for performance\nreasons.\n\nThe base C++ class of a memory handler has a\nflags member that describes how to handle\nmemory I/O. The constructor can call down\nto the base constructor with the flag value\nto initialize by.\n\nDOSBox-X includes code to consume CPU cycles\non memory I/O to simulate the fact that, at\nleast on older hardware, video memory is slower\nthan system memory. There are older DOS games\nthat rely on slow system memory, and they will\nrun too fast without it.\n\nEGA/VGA planar write modes are handled\nin src/hardware/vga_memory.cpp function\nModeOperation().\n\nEGA/VGA planar memory is emulated by treating\nthe allocated RAM as if an array of 32-bit\nunsigned integers (uint32_t). Each bitplane\noccupies 8 bits within that 32-bit unsigned\nint. Keeping the planes together enables\nfaster more efficient emulation of VGA\nbit planar operations including copying\nwith write mode 2 and raster operations,\nas well as Mode X tricks used by older\nDOS games.\n\nDue to the general way that video modes are\nhandled on EGA/VGA/SVGA hardware, all modes\nincluding text mode must operate within the\nconstraints of bytes through the planar\nlayout of VGA video RAM.\n\nOne good example of that requirement is the\nWindows 95 \"boot logo\", which relies on\nIO.SYS setting 320x400 256-color Mode X, then\nresetting BIOS and VGA hardware state so that\nDOS and INT 10h still think the display is in\ntext mode, and the VGA hardware continues to\naccept writes to B8000 as if running in text\nmode. In this way, the text console can\ncontinue to show console output underneath\nthe Windows 95 logo unscathed. When Windows\n95 switches the VGA hardware back to text\nmode, whatever was written to the console\nis revealed.\n\nSome exceptions are made for SVGA chipsets\nknown to function differently, such as the\nTseng ET3000/ET4000 chipsets known to operate\nVGA Mode X differently from standard VGA.\n\nVGA planar memory is handled in the code by\ntypecasting video RAM as a 32-bit unsigned int\n(uint32_t) determined by an index directly\ncomputed from the planar byte offset.\n\nAll EGA/VGA modes are mapped on top of this\nplanar memory structure, in the same way that\nreal hardware maps it. This includes text\nmode (planes 0 & 1 for char/attribute),\nCGA modes (planes 0 & 1 for even/odd bytes),\nand 256-color mode (every 4 pixels is one\nplanar byte, and the pixel in that group\nis mapped to a plane).\n\nThe code as written depends on a host CPU\nthat is little endian, including bit masks\nand shift operations. Bitmask computation\nwill need to be altered to work correctly\non big endian systems in order to work\ncorrectly through the uint32_t typecast.\n\nTo aid with planar memory, a VGA_Latch\nunion is defined that allows the uint32_t\nto be accessed as one whole unit or\nindividual bytes of video memory from the\nbase of the bitplane up.\n\nThe uint32_t masks and shifting should be\nmaintained so that b[0] to b[3] refer to\nthe same bytes of video memory. Only uint32_t\nshould be handled differently to accommodate\nhost byte order.\n\nFor more information, see vga/hardware/vga_memory.cpp\nand vga/hardware/vga.cpp where these bitmasks\nare computed and used.\n\nCrediting of source code\n------------------------\nby Jonathan Campbell.\n\nAs the DOSBox-X project maintainer, I cannot legitimately claim to\nhave written all of the code in this project.\n\nIt's more accurate to say then, that I wrote some of the code,\nthat I rewrote other parts of the code, based on the DOSBox SVN\ncode as it existed since mid 2011.\n\nSome of the code is DOSBox SVN code in which some of the SVN\ncommits made since 2011 were incorporated into DOSBox-X.\n\nSome of the code in this source tree also came from other DOSBox\nforks like DOSBox SVN Daum, DOSBox ECE, DOSBox Staging, DOSVAXJ3,\nas well as vDosPlus.\n\nOther code also came from other developers and contributors of the\nDOSBox-X project such as Wengier, aybe, Allofich, and rderooy.\n\nFor details please look at the CREDITS.md file, which tries to build\na comprehensive list of source code in this repository that was\nborrowed from other projects.\n"

MS Windows users can find this codec in the start menu entry of\r\nDOSBox. Users of Linux and other OSes should look for a movie player that\r\nuses the ffmpeg library (you may need to update or ask your distribution to\r\nupgrade).\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\nQ: During the display of the movies the sound is lagging.\r\nA: Check your display properties to see whether your refresh rate is set to\r\nat least 70 hz. Try playing the movie in virtualdub (http://virtualdub.sf.net)\r\n\r\nQ: Why does the resulting movie consist of multiple files?\r\nA: Each time the game changes resolution, DOSBox creates a new movie file,\r\nbecause a movie file can only contain one resolution.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I set the cycles higher than my PC can handle during recording?\r\nA: Yes. During recording, the game might play slowly and stuttering, but the\r\nresulting movie should play at the intended speed and have no stuttering.\r\n\r\nQ: CTRL-ALT-F5 switches to the console under linux.\r\nA: 1. Start DOSBox like this: dosbox -startmapper\r\n   2. Click on Video, click on Add\r\n   3. Press the key you want (for example scroll lock or printscreen)\r\n   4. Click exit.\r\n   5.

          "content": "xBRZ (https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbrz/) scaler is integrated into DOSBox-X.\n\nTo enable, use\n    scaler=xbrz\nor\n    scaler=xbrz_bilinear\noption in [render] section.\n\nThe difference between two options is in the post-scaling resize method. \nxBRZ scaler uses fixed scale factors, 2X to 6X, which are usually not exactly\nmatching the display window. So nearest size xBRZ scaler output is then \nresized (upscaled/dowscaled) using either nearest neighbor ('xbrz') or \nbilinear ('xbrz_bilinear') algorithm to match the window size.\n\nIt is highly recommended to use 'direct3d' or any of the 'opengl' output modes\nwith xBRZ because bilinear post-scaler performance is terrible and nearest\nneighbor post-scaler does not provide good results.\n\nIn 'direct3d' / 'opengl' output modes, there is no difference between\n'xbrz' and 'xbrz_bilinear' variants, because software post-scaler is not used\nand output is post-scaled by the output interface/hardware.\n\nDifferences from reference implementation on xBRZ site / in Daum build:\n\n- DOSBox-X implementation supports 'surface', 'direct3d' and 'opengl' outputs\n  (including opengl variants 'openglnb' and 'openglhq')\n- Windowed mode is fully working with xBRZ scaler enabled\n- You can combine xBRZ with 'direct3d' mode post-scalers to get i.e. TV effect\n- Enabling xBRZ scaler does not disable 'aspect' option, it is honored\n\nThings to notice:\n\n- The scaler is very CPU intensive so it will run with decent speed for\n  games and demos only on high-end CPUs. Keep this in mind. You can try\n  to correct performance for high output resolutions by using either\n  'xbrz fixed scale factor' or 'xbrz max scale factor' options to limit\n  xBRZ scale factor (lower factors improve performance), of course this\n  reduces image quality for higher output resolutions proportionally.\n\n- Using 'direct3d' or 'opengl' mode actually improves performance a lot\n  because it gets rid of the software post-scaler pass.\n\n- xBRZ scaler code uses parallel processing internally. There is also\n  'xbrz slice' option that affects parallelism, its default (16) gives\n  good results on 4-8 core CPUs.\n\n- When xBRZ scaler is enabled, internal DOSBox scaler options are disabled\n  because any pre-scaling will break xBRZ algorithm. For the same very reason,\n  'doublescan' option is always turned off internally when xBRZ is enabled.\n\n- When using xBRZ in 'surface' output mode and window/screen sizes less than\n  2x of the original DOS resolution, 'xbrz' scaler can degrade quality instead\n  of improving it, use 'direct3d'/'opengl' outputs or 'xbrz_bilinear' scaler\n  variant to avoid this.\n\nCaveats / issues / things to do / incomplete:\n\n- In case video adapter interface uses non-standard color scheme / byte order,\n  colors with xBRZ scaler enabled would most probably be garbled.\n  [YET TO REPRODUCE ANYWHERE]\n"
