The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2.

Here\nis an example of how to generate a distribution with the above mentioned\nrequirements fulfilled (it is assumed the CMake binaries are in the system\npath, this is optional during installation of CMake):\n\n- Add the following directories to your PATH:\n\n        c:\\MinGW64\\bin;c:\\MinGW64\\x86_64-w64-mingw32\\lib32;c:\\MinGW64\\x86_64-w64-mingw32\\include\n\n- Now it is possible to run CMake and mingw32-make:\n\n        C:\\dev\\libnfc-read-only> mkdir ..\\libnfc-build\n      C:\\dev\\libnfc-read-only> cd ..\\libnfc-build\n      C:\\dev\\libnfc-build> cmake-gui .\n\nNow you can configure the build. Press \"Configure\", specify \"MinGW32 Makefiles\"\nand then you have the opportunity to set some configuration variables. If you\ndon't want a Debug build change the variable CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to \"Release\".\n\nIf a non-GUI solution is preferred one can use:\n\n    C:\\dev\\libnfc-build> cmake -G \"MinGW Makefiles\"\n                                     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\\libnfc-read-only\n\nNow run mingw32-make to build:\n\n    C:\\dev\\libnfc-read-only\\bin> mingw32-make\n\nThe build will create a shared library for Windows (nfc.dll) to link your applications against. It will compile\nthe tools against this shared library.\n\nReferences\n==========\n[1] the easiest way is to use the TDM-GCC installer.\n        Make sure to select MinGW-w64 in the installer, the regular MinGW does not contain headers for PCSC.\n        http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/tdm64-gcc-4.5.1.exe/download\n\n[2] http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/\n\n[3] http://www.cmake.org\n"

To do this run\n`autoreconf -vis`\n\nAlternatively use a .tar.bz2 version of a packaged release (which already contains ./configure):\nhttps://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc/releases/\n\nThe build should be as simple as running these commands:\n\n    ./configure\n    make\n\n\nTo build with specific driver(s), see option `--with-drivers=...` detailed in `./configure --help`.\n\nInstallation\n============\n    \n    make install\n\nYou may need to grant permissions to your user to drive your device.\nUnder GNU/Linux systems, if you use udev, you could use the provided udev rules.\n  e.g. under Debian, Ubuntu, etc.\n\n    sudo cp contrib/udev/93-pn53x.rules /lib/udev/rules.d/\n\nUnder FreeBSD, if you use devd, there is also a rules file: contrib/devd/pn53x.conf.\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nIn order to change the default behavior of the library, the libnfc uses a\nconfiguration file located in sysconfdir (as provided to ./configure).\n\nA sample commented file is available in sources: libnfc.conf.sample\n\nIf you have compiled using:\n\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc\n\nyou can make configuration directory and copy the sample file:\n\n    sudo mkdir /etc/nfc\n    sudo cp libnfc.conf.sample /etc/nfc/libnfc.conf\n\nTo configure multiple devices, you can either modify libnfc.conf or create a\nfile per device in a nfc/devices.d directory:\n\n    sudo mkdir -p /etc/nfc/devices.d\n    printf 'name = \"My first device\"\\nconnstring = \"pn532_uart:/dev/ttyACM0\"\\n' | sudo tee /etc/nfc/devices.d/first.conf\n    printf 'name = \"My second device\"\\nconnstring = \"pn532_uart:/dev/ttyACM1\"\\n' | sudo tee /etc/nfc/devices.d/second.conf\n\nEnvironment Variables\n=====================\nYou can override certain configuration options at runtime using the following environment variables:\n+ `LIBNFC_DEFAULT_DEVICE=<connstring>`:  `LIBNFC_DEFAULT_DEVICE=pn532_uart:/dev/ttyACM0` will use pn532 on /dev/ttyACM0 as default device\n+ `LIBNFC_DEVICE=<connstring>` will ignore all devices in the config files and use only the one defined in the variable\n+ `LIBNFC_AUTO_SCAN=<true|false>` overrides `allow_autoscan` option in the config file\n+ `LIBNFC_INTRUSIVE_SCAN=<true|false>` overrides `allow_intrusive_scan` option in the config file\n+ `LIBNFC_LOG_LEVEL=<0|1|2|3>` overrides `log_level` option in the config file\n\nTo obtain the connstring of a recognized device, you can use `nfc-scan-device`: `LIBNFC_AUTO_SCAN=true nfc-scan-device` will show the names & connstrings of all found devices.\n\nHow to report bugs\n==================\n\nTo report a bug, visit https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc/issues and fill\nout a bug report form.\n\nIf you have questions, remarks, we encourage you to post this in the developers\ncommunity:\nhttp://www.libnfc.org/community\n\nPlease make sure to include:\n\n* The version of libnfc\n\n* Information about your system. For instance:\n  \n  - What operating system and version\n  - For Linux, what version of the C library\n  \n  And anything else you think is relevant.\n\n* A trace with debug activated.\n  \n  Reproduce the bug with debug, e.g. if it was:\n  \n        $ nfc-list -v\n  \n  run it as:\n  \n        $ LIBNFC_LOG_LEVEL=3 nfc-list -v\n\n* How to reproduce the bug.\n  \n  Please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior.\n  \n  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece\n  \n  of software that can be downloaded.\n\n* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out\n  \n  when the crash occured.\n\n* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but\n  \n  is not necessary.\n\nPatches\n=======\n\nPatches can be posted to https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc/issues\n\nIf the patch fixes a bug, it is usually a good idea to include\nall the information described in \"How to Report Bugs\".\n\nTroubleshooting\n===============\n\nTouchatag/ACR122:\n-----------------\n\nIf your Touchatag or ACR122 device fails being detected by libnfc, make sure\nthat PCSC-lite daemon (`pcscd`) is installed and is running.\n\nIf your Touchatag or ACR122 device fails being detected by PCSC-lite daemon\n(`pcsc_scan` doesn't see anything) then try removing the bogus firmware detection\nof libccid: edit libccid_Info.plist configuration file (usually\n`/etc/libccid_Info.plist`) and locate `<key>ifdDriverOptions</key>`, turn\n`<string>0x0000</string>` value into `0x0004` to allow bogus devices and restart\npcscd daemon.\n\nACR122:\n-------\n\nUsing an ACR122 device with libnfc and without tag (e.g. to use NFCIP modes or\ncard emulation) needs yet another PCSC-lite tweak: You need to allow usage of\nCCID Exchange command.  To do this, edit `libccid_Info.plist` configuration file\n(usually `/etc/libccid_Info.plist`) and locate `<key>ifdDriverOptions</key>`,\nturn `<string>0x0000</string>` value into `0x0001` to allow CCID exchange or\n`0x0005` to allow CCID exchange and bogus devices (cf previous remark) and\nrestart pcscd daemon.\n\nWarning: if you use ACS CCID drivers (acsccid), configuration file is located\nin something like: `/usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/ifd-acsccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist`\n\nSCL3711:\n--------\n\nLibnfc cannot be used concurrently with the PCSC proprietary driver of SCL3711.\nTwo possible solutions:\n\n* Either you don't install SCL3711 driver at all\n* Or you stop the PCSC daemon when you want to use libnfc-based tools\n\nPN533 USB device on Linux >= 3.1:\n---------------------------------\n\nSince Linux kernel version 3.1, a few kernel-modules must not be loaded in order\nto use libnfc : \"nfc\", \"pn533\" and \"pn533_usb\".\nTo prevent kernel from loading automatically these modules, you can blacklist\nthem in a modprobe conf file. This file is provided within libnfc archive:\n\n    sudo cp contrib/linux/blacklist-libnfc.conf /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-libnfc.conf\n\nFEITIAN bR500 and R502:\n-----------------------\n\nLibnfc can work with PCSC proprietary driver of bR500 and R502, which is already available on most Linux setups.\nTo activate the PCSC support: `./configure --with-drivers=pcsc`.\nReaders known to work:\n\n- Feitian bR500\n- Feitian R502 Dual interface reader\n- Feitian R502 CL(Contactless) reader\n\nThese readers are support by CCID since v1.4.25, make sure your CCID driver version higher or equal to 1.4.25.\n\nOn MacOS, you can check your CCID version with the following command, and if required, you can install latest CCID driver from [https://github.com/martinpaljak/osx-ccid-installer/releases](https://github.com/martinpaljak/osx-ccid-installer/releases)\n\n```\ngrep -A 1 CFBundleShortVersionString /usr/local/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist\n```\n\nOn Linux, you can check your CCID version with the following command, and if required, you can install latest CCID driver from [https://ccid.apdu.fr/](https://ccid.apdu.fr/)\n\n```\ngrep -A 1 CFBundleShortVersionString /usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist\n```\n\nProprietary Notes\n=================\nFeliCa is a registered trademark of the Sony Corporation.\nMIFARE is a trademark of NXP Semiconductors.\nJewel Topaz is a trademark of Innovision Research & Technology.\nAll other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\n"
