          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWe are really glad that you are reading this, because we need volunteer developers and maintainers to enhance this open source project. Pls feel free to submit issues, bugfixes or new features. We really appreciate any contributing work you made to the project.\n\nIn general, you can contribute the project in three ways as listed below.\n\n* Contribute codes to the project, either bugfix or new feature is appreciated.\n* Review pull requests of the project.\n* Solve issues of the project.\n\n## 1. Contribute Codes\n\nHow to contribute codes to the project? In general, we follow the \"fork-and-pull\" [Git workflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Two main branches with infinite lifetime exist: **master** and **devel**. It is recommended that you should follow the workflow below if you want to submit a patch to the project.\n\n* S1. **Fork** the repo on Github.\n* S2. **Clone** the project to your local develop environments.\n* S3. **Checkout** to `devel` branch of the project in you local develop environments.\n* S4. **Commit** changes on your local branch.\n* S5. **Push** your work back to the forked repo on Github.\n* S6. Submit a **Pull Request** so that we can review your changes.\n\nNOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from \"upstream\" before making a pull request!\n\n## 2. Review [Pull Requests](https://github.com/iqiyi/dpvs/pulls)\n\nIn consideration of the complexity of some pull requests(PR), the DPVS PRs are reviewed in a stage by stage way. In order to demonstrate the PR review progress explictly, a series of [PR labels](https://github.com/iqiyi/dpvs/labels) are defined by DPVS Maintainers. All PR labels start with prefix 'pr/'. There are two types of PR labels: the stage labels, and the status labels. The former show what need to do of the current stage, while the later show the status of previous stages. According to whether problems were found in previous stages, status labels are of two types: status ok labels, and status false labels. The following table list all the PR labels that DPVS has defined.\n\n| stage                                                        | status /ok                                                   | status/false                                                 |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">to-confirm-needs</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">needs-confirmed</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">do-not-need</span>   |\n| <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">to-confirm-bug</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">bug-confirmed</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">not-a-bug</span>     |\n| <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">to-review-codes</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">codes-reviewed-ok</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">codes-need-change</span> |\n| <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">to-test-codes</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">codes-tested-ok</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">codes-test-failed</span> |\n| <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">to-evaluate-performance</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">performance-ok</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">performance-bad</span> |\n| <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">to-test-compatibility</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">compatibility-ok</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">compatibility-bad</span> |\n| <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">to-accept-or-reject</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">accepted</span>      | <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">rejected</span>      |\n\nDifferent types of labels are colored with different colors. PR labels are described in summary here.\n* stage labels: colored <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">orange</span>, what to do for the PR.\n* status labels:\n  - status-ok labels: colored <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">green</span>, the PR status is ok and review progress can continue.\n  - status-false labels: colored <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">purple</span>, problems are found and the PR needs modification or to be rejected.\n\nThe figure below shows the overall review progress of a PR.\n![maintainence-pr](./pic/maintainence-pr.png)\n\n* S1. DPVS maintainers assign a stage label(label of orange color) to a PR.\n* S2. Reviewers check the PR list, pick those labels with orange color, and do the current review stage work. Submit the review results within the PR.\n* S3. DPVS maintainers assign a status label according to the review results, i.e. a status-ok label if the no problem found of this stage, otherwise a status-false label.\n* S4. If subsequent review stages are needed, goto step S1, otherwise close the PR.\n\nIt should be noted that not all the six stages are required for simple PRs. For example, \"to-test-codes\", \"to-evaluate-performance\" and \"to-test-compatibility\" stages may be skipped if they are not needed obviously.\n\n**Anyone can pick the PRs colored with orange and do the work of current stage. If your work is verified, it would take into account when we consider your activeness in DPVS community, and you may get awarded.**\n\nIt is expected that the PRs should be reviewed in a week and closed(merged or rejected) in a month. Complicated PRs may need longer timer to review, maintainers should update the review progress timely and keep in touch with code contributors if the codes in the PR need modification before accepted.\n\n## 3. Solve [Issues](https://github.com/iqiyi/dpvs/issues)\n\nIt's appreciated to help dpvs maintainers solve the Issues from DPVS community, especially those reporting bugs or problems. Nothing is more pleasant than helping others, isn't it?  Similar to PRs, a series of [issue labels](https://github.com/iqiyi/dpvs/labels) are defined by DPVS maintainers, which have fixed prefix 'issue/'. Similarly, the issue labels are also have different types.\n\n* stage labels: colored <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">orange</span>, what to do for the issue.\n* status labels:\n  - status-ok labels: colored <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">green</span>, the issue status is ok.\n  - status-false labels: colored <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">purple</span>, the issue is not a problem.\n\n| stage labels                                                | status/ok label                                           | status/false labels                                          |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">to-reproduce</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">reproduced</span> | <span style=\"background-color:#ea3cc7;\">not-reproduced</span> |\n| <span style=\"background-color:#fbca04;\">to-solve</span>     | <span style=\"background-color:#e6f9a7;\">solved</span>     |                                                              |\n\nThe figure below shows the processing progress of an DPVS issue.\n![maintainence-issue](./pic/maintainence-issues.png)\n\n**Anyone can pick the Issues colored orange and do the work of current stage. If the issue is confirmed to be solved, it would take into account when we consider your activeness in DPVS community, and you may get awarded.**\n\nIt is expected that Issues should be replied in a week and solved in a month. If the issue author is not replied after a month from reply, the issue is closed.\n\n# Coding conventions\n\nBasically, codeing style should be consistent in the whole project. We recommend to use the [Linux kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#).\n\nNOTE: As for indentations, we use 4-char indents, not 8-char indents. This is different from Linux kernel coding style.\n\n# Rewards to Contributors\n\nThe DPVS contributors(including code contributors, PR reviewers, and issue solvers) can be rewarded in the following aspects.\n\n* Excellent contributors should be invited into **DPVS maintainers**, who are granted with high privileges of the project.\n* IQIYI would prepare some **gold membership cards** for the active contributors every year.\n\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    {description}\n    Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  {signature of Ty Coon}, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.

It's derived from Linux Virtual Server [LVS](http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/) and its modification [alibaba/LVS](https://github.com/alibaba/LVS).\n\n> Notes: The name `DPVS` comes from \"DPDK-LVS\".\n\n![dpvs.png](./pic/dpvs.png)\n\nSeveral techniques are applied for high performance:\n\n* *Kernel by-pass* (user space implementation).\n* *Share-nothing*, per-CPU for key data (lockless).\n* *RX Steering* and *CPU affinity* (avoid context switch).\n* *Batching* TX/RX.\n* *Zero Copy* (avoid packet copy and syscalls).\n* *Polling* instead of interrupt.\n* *Lockless message* for high performance IPC.\n* Other techs enhanced by *DPDK*.\n\nMajor features of `DPVS` including:\n\n* *L4 Load Balancer*, supports FNAT, DR, Tunnel and DNAT reverse proxy modes.\n* *NAT64* mode for IPv6 quick adaption without changing backend server.\n* *SNAT* mode for Internet access from internal network.\n* Adequate *schedule algorithms* like RR, WLC, WRR, MH(Maglev Hash), Conhash(Consistent Hash), etc.\n* User-space *lite network stack*: IPv4, IPv6, Routing, ARP, Neighbor, ICMP, LLDP, IPset, etc.\n* Support *KNI*, *VLAN*, *Bonding*, *IP Tunnel* for different IDC environment.\n* Security aspects support *TCP SYN-proxy*, *Allow/Deny ACL*.\n* QoS features such as  *Traffic Control*, *Concurrent Connection Limit*.\n* Versatile tools, services can be configured with `dpip` `ipvsadm` command line tools, or from config files of `keepalived`, or via restful API provided by `dpvs-agent`.\n\nDPVS consists of the modules illustrated in the diagram below.\n\n![modules](./pic/modules.svg)\n\n# Quick Start\n\n## Test Environment\n\nThis *quick start* is performed in the environments described below.\n\n* Linux Distribution: CentOS 7.6\n* Kernel: 3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64\n* CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz\n* NIC: Intel Corporation Ethernet Controller 10-Gigabit X540-AT2 (rev 03)\n* Memory: 64G with two NUMA node.\n* GCC: 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-36)\n* Golang: go1.20.4 linux/amd64 (required only when CONFIG_DPVS_AGENT enabled).\n\nOther environments should also be OK if DPDK works, please check [dpdk.org](http://www.dpdk.org) for more information.\n\n> Notes:\n> 1. Please check this link for NICs supported by DPDK: http://dpdk.org/doc/nics.\n> 2. `Flow Control` ([rte_flow](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/nics/overview.html#id1)) is required for `FNAT` and `SNAT` mode when DPVS running on multi-cores unless `conn redirect` is enabled. The minimum requirements to ensure DPVS works with multi-core properly is that `rte_flow` must support \"ipv4, ipv6, tcp, udp\" four items, and \"drop, queue\" two actions.\n> 3. DPVS doesn't confine itself to the this test environments. In fact, DPVS is an user-space application which relies very little on operating system, kernel versions, compilers, and other platform discrepancies. As far as is known, DPVS has been verified at least in the following environments.\n>   * Centos 7.2, 7.6, 7.9\n>   * Anolis 8.6, 8.8, 8.9\n>   * GCC 4.8, 8.5\n>   * Kernel: 3.10.0, 4.18.0, 5.10.134\n>   * NIC: Intel IXGBE, NVIDIA MLX5\n\n## Clone DPVS\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/iqiyi/dpvs.git\n$ cd dpvs\n```\n\nWell, let's start from DPDK then.\n\n## DPDK setup\n\nCurrently, `dpdk-stable-20.11.10` is recommended for `DPVS`, and we will not support dpdk version earlier than dpdk-20.11 any more. If you are still using earlier dpdk versions, such as `dpdk-stable-17.11.6` and `dpdk-stable-18.11.2`, please use earlier DPVS releases, such as [v1.8.12](https://github.com/iqiyi/dpvs/releases/tag/v1.8.12).\n\n> Notes: You can skip this section if experienced with DPDK, and refer the [link](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/index.html) for details.\n\n```bash\n$ wget https://fast.dpdk.org/rel/dpdk-20.11.10.tar.xz   # download from dpdk.org if link failed.\n$ tar xf dpdk-20.11.10.tar.xz\n```\n\n### DPDK patchs\n\nThere are some patches for DPDK to support extra features needed by DPVS. Apply them if needed. For example, there's a patch for DPDK `kni` driver for hardware multicast, apply it if you are to launch `ospfd` on `kni` device.\n\n> Notes: It's assumed we are in DPVS root directory where you have installed dpdk-stable-20.11.10 source codes. Please note it's not mandatory, just for convenience.\n\n```\n$ cd <path-of-dpvs>\n$ cp patch/dpdk-stable-20.11.10/*.patch dpdk-stable-20.11.10/\n$ cd dpdk-stable-20.11.10/\n$ patch -p1 < 0001-kni-use-netlink-event-for-multicast-driver-part.patch\n$ patch -p1 < 0002-pdump-change-dpdk-pdump-tool-for-dpvs.patch\n$ ...\n```\n\n> Tips: It's advised to patch all if your are not sure about what they are meant for.\n \n### DPDK build and install\n\nUse meson-ninja to build DPDK, and export environment variable `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` for DPDK application (DPVS). The sub-Makefile `src/dpdk.mk` in DPVS will check the presence of libdpdk.\n\n```bash\n$ cd dpdk-stable-20.11.10\n$ mkdir dpdklib                 # user desired install folder\n$ mkdir dpdkbuild               # user desired build folder\n$ meson -Denable_kmods=true -Dprefix=dpdklib dpdkbuild\n$ ninja -C dpdkbuild\n$ cd dpdkbuild; ninja install\n$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(pwd)/../dpdklib/lib64/pkgconfig/\n```\n\n> Tips: You can use script [dpdk-build.sh](./scripts/dpdk-build.sh) to facilitate dpdk build. Run `dpdk-build.sh -h` for the usage of the script.\n\nNext is to set up DPDK hugepage. Our test environment is NUMA system. For single-node system please refer to the [link](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/sys_reqs.html).\n\n```bash\n$ # for NUMA machine\n$ echo 8192 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages\n$ echo 8192 > /sys/devices/system/node/node1/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages\n```\nBy default, hugetlbfs is mounted at `/dev/hugepages`, as shown below.\n\n```bash\n$ mount | grep hugetlbfs\nhugetlbfs on /dev/hugepages type hugetlbfs (rw,relatime)\n```\nIf it's not your case, you should mount hugetlbfs by yourself.\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir /mnt/huge\n$ mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge\n```\n\n> Notes:\n> 1. Hugepages of other size, such as 1GB-size hugepages, can also be used if your system supports.\n> 2. It's recommended to reserve hugepage memory and isolate CPUs used by DPVS with linux kernel cmdline options in production environments, for example `isolcpus=1-9 default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=32`.\n\nNext, install kernel modules required by DPDK and DPVS.\n\n* DPDK driver kernel module: \nDepending on your NIC and system, NIC may require binding a DPDK-compitable driver, such as `vfio-pci`, `igb_uio`, or `uio_pci_generic`. Refer to [DPDK doc](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/linux_drivers.html) for more details. In this test, we use the linux standard UIO kernel module `uio_pci_generic`.\n\n* KNI kernel module: \nKNI kernel module `rte_kni.ko` is required by DPVS as the exception data path which processes packets not dealt with in DPVS to kernel stack.\n\n```bash\n$ modprobe uio_pci_generic\n\n$ cd dpdk-stable-20.11.10\n$ insmod dpdkbuild/kernel/linux/kni/rte_kni.ko carrier=on\n\n$ # bind eth0 to uio_pci_generic (Be aware: Network on eth0 will get broken!)\n$ ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --status\n$ ifconfig eth0 down          # assuming eth0's pci-bus location is 0000:06:00.0\n$ ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b uio_pci_generic 0000:06:00.0\n```\n> Notes:\n> 1. The test in our Quick Start uses only one NIC. Bind as many NICs as required in your DPVS application to DPDK driver kernel module. For example, you should bind at least 2 NICs if you are testing DPVS with two-arm.\n> 2. `dpdk-devbind.py -u` can be used to unbind driver and switch it back to Linux driver like `ixgbe`. Use `lspci` or `ethtool -i eth0` to check the NIC's PCI bus-id. Please refer to [DPDK Doc:Binding and Unbinding Network Ports to/from the Kernel Modules](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/linux_drivers.html#binding-and-unbinding-network-ports-to-from-the-kernel-modules) for more details.\n> 3. NVIDIA/Mellanox NIC uses bifurcated driver which doesn't rely on UIO/VFIO driver, so not bind any DPDK driver kernel module, but [NVIDIA MLNX_OFED/EN](https://network.nvidia.com/products/infiniband-drivers/linux/mlnx_ofed/) is required. Refer to [Mellanox DPDK](https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/article/mellanox-dpdk) for its PMD and [Compilation Prerequisites](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/platform/mlx5.html#linux-prerequisites) for OFED installation.\n> 4. A kernel module parameter `carrier` has been added to `rte_kni.ko` since [DPDK v18.11](https://elixir.bootlin.com/dpdk/v18.11/source/kernel/linux/kni/kni_misc.c), and the default value for it is \"off\". We need to load `rte_kni.ko` with extra parameter `carrier=on` to make KNI devices work properly.\n> 5. Multiple DPVS instances can run on a single server if there are enough NICs or VFs within one NIC. Refer to [tutorial:Multiple Instances](https://github.com/iqiyi/dpvs/blob/devel/doc/tutorial.md#multi-instance) for details.\n\n## Build DPVS\n\nIt's simple, just set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` and build it.\n\n```bash\n$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<path-of-libdpdk.pc>  # normally located at dpdklib/lib64/pkgconfig/\n$ cd <path-of-dpvs>\n\n$ make              # or \"make -j\" to speed up\n$ make install\n```\n> Notes:\n> 1. Build dependencies may be needed, such as `pkg-config`(version 0.29.2+, `automake`, `libnl3`, `libnl-genl-3.0`, `openssl`, `popt` and `numactl`. You can install the missing dependencies with package manager of your system, e.g., `yum install popt-devel automake` (CentOS) or `apt install libpopt-dev autoconfig` (Ubuntu).\n> 2. Early `pkg-config` versions (v0.29.2 before) may cause dpvs build failure. If so, please upgrade this tool. Specially, you may upgrade the `pkg-config` on Centos7 to meet the version requirement.\n> 3. If you want to compile `dpvs-agent` and `healthcheck`, enable `CONFIG_DPVS_AGENT` in config.mk, and install Golang build environments(Refer to [go.mod](tools/dpvs-agent/go.mod) file for required Golang version).\n\nOutput binary files are installed to `dpvs/bin`.\n\n```bash\n$ ls bin/\ndpip  dpvs  dpvs-agent  healthcheck  ipvsadm  keepalived\n```\n\n* `dpvs` is the main program.\n* `dpip` is the tool to manage IP address, route, vlan, neigh, etc.\n* `ipvsadm` and `keepalived` come from LVS, both are modified.\n* `dpvs-agent` and `healthcheck` are alternatives to `keepalived` powered with HTTP API developed with Golang.\n\n## Launch DPVS\n\nNow, `dpvs.conf` must locate at `/etc/dpvs.conf`, just copy it from `conf/dpvs.conf.single-nic.sample`.\n\n```bash\n$ cp conf/dpvs.conf.single-nic.sample /etc/dpvs.conf\n```\n\nand start DPVS,\n\n```bash\n$ cd <path-of-dpvs>/bin\n$ ./dpvs &\n\n$ # alternatively and strongly advised, start DPVS with NIC and CPU explicitly specified:\n$ ./dpvs -- -a 0000:06:00.0 -l 1-9\n```\n> Notes:\n> 1. Run `./dpvs --help` for DPVS supported command line options, and `./dpvs -- --help` for common DPDK EAL command line options.\n> 2. The default `dpvs.conf` require 9 CPUs(1 master worker, 8 slave workers), modify it if not so many available CPUs in your system.\n\nCheck if it's get started ?\n\n```bash\n$ ./dpip link show\n1: dpdk0: socket 0 mtu 1500 rx-queue 8 tx-queue 8\n    UP 10000 Mbps full-duplex fixed-nego promisc-off\n    addr A0:36:9F:9D:61:F4 OF_RX_IP_CSUM OF_TX_IP_CSUM OF_TX_TCP_CSUM OF_TX_UDP_CSUM\n```\n\nIf you see this message. Well done, `DPVS` is working with NIC `dpdk0`!\n\n>Don't worry if you see this error:\n```\nEAL: Error - exiting with code: 1\n  Cause: ports in DPDK RTE (2) != ports in dpvs.conf(1)\n```\n>It means the number of NIC recognized by DPVS mismatched `/etc/dpvs.conf`. Please either modify NIC number in `dpvs.conf` or specify NICs with EAL option `-a` explicitly.\n\nWhat config items does `dpvs.conf` support? How to configure them? Well, `DPVS` maintains a config item file `conf/dpvs.conf.items` which lists all supported config entries, default values, and feasible value ranges. Besides, some sample config files maintained in `./conf/dpvs.*.sample` gives practical configurations of DPVS in corresponding circumstances.\n\n## Test Full-NAT (FNAT) Load Balancer\n\nThe test topology looks like the following diagram.\n\n![fnat-single-nic](./pic/fnat-single-nic.png)\n\nSet VIP and Local IP (LIP, needed by FNAT mode) on DPVS. Let's put commands into `setup.sh`. You do some check by `./ipvsadm -ln`, `./dpip addr show`.\n\n```bash\n$ cat setup.sh\nVIP=192.168.100.100\nLIP=192.168.100.200\nRS=192.168.100.2\n\n./dpip addr add ${VIP}/24 dev dpdk0\n./ipvsadm -A -t ${VIP}:80 -s rr\n./ipvsadm -a -t ${VIP}:80 -r ${RS}:80 -b\n\n./ipvsadm --add-laddr -z ${LIP} -t ${VIP}:80 -F dpdk0\n$\n$ ./setup.sh\n```\n\nAccess VIP from Client, it looks good!\n\n```bash\nclient $ curl 192.168.100.100\nYour ip:port : 192.168.100.3:56890\n```\n\n## Tutorial Docs\n\nMore examples can be found in the [Tutorial Document](./doc/tutorial.md). Including,\n\n* WAN-to-LAN `FNAT` reverse proxy.\n* Direct Route (`DR`) mode setup.\n* Master/Backup model (`keepalived`) setup.\n* OSPF/ECMP cluster model setup.\n* `SNAT` mode for Internet access from internal network.\n* Virtual Devices (`Bonding`, `VLAN`, `kni`, `ipip`/`GRE` tunnel).\n* `UOA` module to get real UDP client IP/port in `FNAT`.\n* ... and more ...\n\nWe also listed some frequently asked questions in the [FAQ Document](./doc/faq.md).
