By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

With this method even\n windows hosts, reply to the call-for-reply (they don't reply on\n broadcast-ping).\n Be very careful if the netmask is a class B (255.255.0.0) because ettercap\n will send 255*255 = 65025 arp requests (the default delay between two \n requests is 1 millisecond, can be configured in etter.conf)\n\n\n### UNIFIED SNIFFING\n\n Ettercap NG uses the unified sniffing method which is the base for all the\n attacks. The kernel ip forwarding is always disabled and this task is\n accomplished by ettercap itself. Packet that needs to be forwarded are packets\n with destination mac address equal to the attacker's one, but with different ip\n address. Those packets are re-sent back to the wire to the real destination.\n This way, you can plug in various mitm attacks at a time. You can even use\n external attacker/poisoner, they only have to redirect packets to ettercap's\n host and the game is over ;)\n\n\n### BRIDGED SNIFFING\n\n Uses two network interfaces and forwards the traffic between them while performing\n sniffing and content filtrating. This sniffing method is very stealthy as there\n is no way to to detect that someone is in the middle. You can look at this as a layer\n one attack. Don't use it on gateways or it will transform your gateway into a bridge.\n \n HINT: You can use the content filtering engine to drop packets that should not pass.\n This way ettercap will work as an inline IPS ;)\n\n\n### ARP POISONING ATTACK\n\n When you select this method, ettercap will poison the arp cache of the\n two hosts, identifying itself as the other host respectively (see the\n next section for this).\n Once the arp caches are poisoned, the two hosts start the connection, but\n their packets will be sent to us, and we will record them and, next,\n forward them to the right side of the connection. So the connection is\n transparent to the victims, not arguing that they are sniffed. The only\n method to discover that there is a man-in-the-middle in your connection, is\n to watch at the arp cache and check if there are two hosts with the same\n mac address!\n That is how we discover if there are others poisoning the arp cache\n in our LAN, thus being warned, that our traffic is under control! =)\n\n```\n     HOST 1  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -> HOST 2\n   (poisoned)                                      (poisoned)\n       |                                               ^\n       |                                               |\n        ------------> ATTACKER HOST  ------------------\n                      ( ettercap )\n\n Legenda:\n             - - - ->   the logic connection\n             ------->   the real one\n```\n\n The arp protocol has an intrinsic insecurity. In order to reduce the\n traffic on the cable, it will insert an entry in the arp cache even if it\n wasn't requested. In other words, EVERY arp reply that goes on the wire\n will be inserted in the arp table.\n So, we take advantage of this \"feature\", sending fake arp replies to the two\n hosts we will sniff. In this reply we will tell that the mac address of the\n second host is the one hard-coded on OUR ethernet card. This host will now\n send packets that should go to the first host, to us, because he carries\n our mac address.\n The same process is done for the first host, in inverse manner, so we have\n a perfect man-in-the-middle connection between the two hosts, legally\n receiving their packets!!\n\n   Example:\n\n     HOST 1:  mac: 01:01:01:01:01:01         ATTACKER HOST:\n               ip: 192.168.0.1                    mac: 03:03:03:03:03:03\n                                                   ip: 192.168.0.3\n\n     HOST 2:  mac: 02:02:02:02:02:02\n               ip: 192.168.0.2\n\n\n   we send arp replys to:\n\n            HOST 1 telling that 192.168.0.2 is on 03:03:03:03:03:03\n            HOST 2 telling that 192.168.0.1 is on 03:03:03:03:03:03\n\n   now they are poisoned !! they will send their packets to us !\n   then if receive packets from:\n\n            HOST 1 we will forward to 02:02:02:02:02:02\n            HOST 2 we will forward to 01:01:01:01:01:01\n\n   simple, isn't it ?\n\n **LINUX KERNEL 2.4.x ISSUE**\n\n In the latest release of the linux kernel we can find in :\n `/usr/src/linux/net/ipv4/arp.c`\n\n```\n /* Unsolicited ARP is not accepted by default.\n    It is possible, that this option should be enabled for some\n    devices (strip is candidate)\n */\n```\n\n these kernels use a special neighbor system to prevent unsolicited arp\n replies (what ettercap sends to the victim).\n Good gracious, is ettercap unusable with that kernel ? the answer is NO !\n let's view why... in the same source code we find:\n\n```\n /*\n *  Process entry.  The idea here is we want to send a reply if it is a\n *  request for us or if it is a request for someone else that we hold\n *  a proxy for.  We want to add an entry to our cache if it is a reply\n *  to us or if it is a request for our address.\n *  (The assumption for this last is that if someone is requesting our\n *  address, they are probably intending to talk to us, so it saves time\n *  if we cache their address.  Their address is also probably not in\n *  our cache, since ours is not in their cache.)\n *\n *  Putting this another way, we only care about replies if they are to\n *  us, in which case we add them to the cache.  For requests, we care\n *  about those for us and those for our proxies.  We reply to both,\n *  and in the case of requests for us we add the requester to the arp\n *  cache.\n */\n```\n\n so, if the kernel receives a REQUEST it will cache the host...\n what does that mean ? if ettercap sends spoofed REQUESTS instead of\n REPLIES the kernel will cache them ? the answer is YES !!\n\n ettercap 0.6.0 and later has this new ARP REQUEST POISONING method.\n it will alternate request and replies on poisoning because other OS doesn't\n have this \"feature\"...\n\n\n **SOLARIS ISSUE**\n\n Solaris will not cache a reply if it isn't already in the cache.\n The trick is simple, before poisoning, ettercap sends a spoofed ICMP\n ECHO_REQUEST to the host, it has to reply on it and it will make an arp\n entry for the spoofed host. Then we can begin to poison as always, the\n entry is now in the cache...\n\n\n### ICMP REDIRECTION\n\n This attack implements ICMP redirection. It sends a spoofed icmp redirect\n message to the hosts in the lan pretending to be a best route for internet. \n All connections to internet will be redirected to the attacker which, in turn,\n will forward them to the real gateway. The resulting attack is an HALF-DUPLEX\n mitm. Only the client is redirected, since the gateway will not accept redirect\n messages for a directly connected network. \n\n\n### DHCP SPOOFING\n\n This attack implements DHCP spoofing. It pretends to be a DHCP server and try\n to win the race condition with the real one to force the client to accept\n replies from it. This way the attacker is able to manipulate the GW parameter and\n hijack all the outgoing traffic generated by the clients.\n The resulting attack is an HALF-DUPLEX mitm. \n\n\n### PORT STEALING\n\n This technique is useful to sniff in a switched environment when ARP poisoning\n is not effective (for example where static mapped ARPs are used).\n It floods the LAN with ARP packets. The destination MAC address of each \n \"stealing\" packet is the same as the attacker's one (other NICs won't see these \n packets), the source MAC address will be one of the MACs of the victims.\n This process \"steals\" the switch's port of each victim. \n Using low delays, packets destined to \"stolen\" MAC addresses will be received \n by the attacker, winning the race condition with the real port owner. \n When the attacker receives packets for \"stolen\" hosts, it stops the flooding \n process and performs an ARP request for the real destination of the packet. \n When it receives the ARP reply it's sure that the victim has \"taken back\" his \n port, so ettercap can re-send the packet to the destination as is.\n Now we can re-start the flooding process waiting for new packets.\n\n\n### CHARACTERS INJECTION\n\n We have stated that the packets are for us...\n And the packets will not be received by destination until we forward them.\n But what happens if we change them?\n Yes, they reach destination with our modifications.\n We can modify, add, delete the content of these packets, by simply\n recalculating the checksum and substituting them on the traffic.\n But we can do also more: we can insert packets in the connection.\n We forge our packets with the right sequence and acknowledgement number and\n send them to the desired host. When the next packets will pass through us\n we simply subtract or add the sequence number with the amount of data we\n have injected till the connection is alive, preventing the connection to be\n rejected (this until we close ettercap, who maintains sequence numbers\n correct, after program exit, the connection must be RESET or all future\n traffic would be rejected, blocking the source workstation network).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Injector supports escape sequences. you can make multi-line injection\n>  - eg: \"this on line one \\n this on line two \\n and so on...\"\n>  - eg: \"this in hex mode: \\x65\\x6c\\x6c\\x65\"\n>  - eg: \"this in oct mode: \\101\\108\\108\\101\"\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> remember to terminate your injection with \\r\\n if you want to inject command to the server.\n\n### SSH1 MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE\n\n When the connection starts (remember that we are the master-of-packets, all\n packets go through ettercap) we substitute the server public key with one\n generated on the fly and save it in a list so we can remember that this\n server has been poisoned before.\n Then the client send the packet containing the session key ciphered with\n our key, so we are able to decipher it and sniff the real 3DES session key.\n Now we encrypt the packet with the correct server public key and forward it\n to the SSH daemon.\n The connection is established normally, but we have the session key !!\n Now we can decrypt all the traffic and sit down watching the stream !\n The connection will remain active even if we exit from ettercap, because\n ettercap doesn't proxy it (like dsniff). After the exchange of the keys,\n ettercap is only a spectator... ;)\n\n\n### PACKET FILTERING\n\n Like character injection, we can modify the packets payload and replace\n the right sequence and acknowledgement number if needed.\n With the integrated filtering engine you can program your own filters\n to make the best filter for your aims.\n A scripting languages is used to make filters source that must be compiled\n with etterfilter(8) in order to be used by ettercap.\n \n\n### PASSIVE SCANNING OF THE LAN\n\n This feature is very useful if you want to know the topology of the lan but\n you don't want to send any packet on it. In this way the scan is done entirely\n by sniffing packets and extracting useful information from them.\n This scan will let you know the hosts in the lan (it watches ARP request), the\n Operating System of the hosts (it uses passive os fingerprint... see next\n section), the open ports of an host (looking the SYN+ACK packet), the gateway,\n the routers or hosts acting as a router (it watches ICMP messages).\n As a passive method it is useless on a switched lan (because it can make a\n topology only of the host that are connecting to you), but if you put it on a\n gateway and let it run for hours or days, it will make a complete report of\n the hosts in the lan.\n\n\n### PASSIVE OS FINGERPRINT\n\n The main idea is to analyze the passive information coming from a host\n when it makes or receives connections with other hosts. This information\n is enough to detect the OS and the running services of the host.\n In this scenario, we look at SYN and SYN+ACK packet and collect some\n interesting info from them:\n Window Size: the TCP header field\n MSS: the TCP option Maximum Segment Size (can be present or not)\n TTL: the IP header field Time To Live (rounded to the next power of 2)\n Window Scale: the TCP option indicating the Scale\n SACK: the TCP option for the Selective ACK\n NOP: if the TCP options contain a NOP\n DF: the IP header field Don't Fragment\n TIMESTAMP: if the TCP timestamp option is enabled\n and obviously the type of the packet (SYN or SYN+ACK)\n\n The database contains different fingerprints for each type of packet\n because some OSes have different fingerprints from SYN to SYN+ACK.\n Obviously the SYN fingerprint is more reliable, because the SYN+ACK is\n influenced by the SYN (if a SYN doesn't contain a SACK the SYN+ACK will not\n have the SACK option even if the host support it). So while collecting\n information off the lan, if we receive a SYN+ACK we mark the OS of that\n host as temporary and when we receive a SYN we confirm that.\n Fingerprints ending with an \":A\" are less reliable... this is \n because some OS identification may change during the gathering process.\n\n The SYN+ACK packets are also used to discover the open ports of a host.\n (see next section)\n\n The interesting thing is that firewalls, gateways and NAT are transparent to\n passive OS detection. So collecting info for the LAN will let you know info\n even for remote hosts. Only proxies aren't transparent because they make a\n new connection to the target.\n\n Our fingerprint database has to be enlarged, so if you find a host with an\n unknown fingerprint and you know for sure the OS of that host, please mail\n us <alor@users.sourceforge.net> the fingerprint and the OS, we will insert\n in the database.\n\n\n### OPEN PORTS\n\n Open ports are identified by looking for SYN+ACK packets.\n If a SYN+ACK comes from a port, it is for sure open, except for the\n channel command of FTP protocol, for that reason SYN+ACK going to port 20\n are not used to indicate a open port.\n For the udp ports the question is a little bit difficult because no SYN or\n ACK packet are present in the udp protocol, so ettercap assumes that a udp\n port < 1024 that sends packets is opened. We know that in this way we cannot\n discover open ports > 1024 but they can go undetected as open when a client\n sends packet to a server.\n\n\n### GATEWAY AND ROUTERS\n\n The gateway is simply recognized looking at IP packet with a non local ip\n ( checking the netmask ). If a non local IP is found, ettercap look at the\n ethernet address (MAC) and store it as the gateway mac address, then it\n search for it in the list and mark the corresponding ip as the gateway.\n\n Looking in the ICMP messages we can rely that if a host sends a\n TTL-exceeded or a redirect messages it is a router or an host acting as it.\n\n\n==============================================================================\n\nvim:ts=3:expandtab\n\n"
