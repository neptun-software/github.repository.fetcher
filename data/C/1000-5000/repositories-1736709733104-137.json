To start the build, import\nthe root directory of this project into Android Studio as an existing Android\nStudio project, or follow the instructions below to build on the command line.\n\n## _Building with Android Studio_\n\nThe Gradle build uses the gradle-stable plugin and the Android NDK to\nbuild the Tesseract and Leptonica native C/C++ code through a call to\n`ndk-build` in `build.gradle`. In Android Studio, use \n\nBuild -> Rebuild Project\n\nto build or rebuild the project.\n\nNote: When building from Android Studio, you may need to set the path to your\nNDK installation in the Project Structure dialog (File->Project Structure).\n\n## _Building on the Command Line_\n\n_On Mac/Linux:_\n\nEdit your local.properties file to include the path to your NDK directory:\n\n    ndk.dir=/path/to/your/android-ndk\n\nRun the following commands:\n\n    export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android-sdk\n    git clone git://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two tess\n    cd tess\n    ./gradlew assemble\n\t\t\n_On Windows:_\n\nEdit your local.properties file to include the path to your NDK directory:\n\n    ndk.dir=C\\:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\android-ndk\n\nRun the following commands:\n\n    set ANDROID_HOME=C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\your\\\\android-sdk\n    git clone git://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two tess\n    cd tess\n    gradlew assemble\n\n# Importing\n\nAfter building, the code that is generated may be imported into your app\nproject in Android Studio as a module using\n\nFile -> New -> Import Module -> `tess-two` folder\n\nand then adding the dependency to your app module build.gradle:\n\n        dependencies {\n            implementation project(':tess-two')\n        }\n\n# Testing\n\n_On Mac/Linux:_\n\n    ./preparetests.sh\n    ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest\n\n_On Windows:_\n\n    preparetests.cmd\n    gradlew connectedAndroidTest\n\n# Removing\n\nIf you want to remove your app's dependency on the tess-two module, reverse\nthe import process by removing the module using the Project Structure dialog\n(File->Project Structure), manually deleting the tess-two subfolder from your\napp project folder, and removing the tess-two reference from your app module\nbuild.gradle."

Tesseract Tools for Android is a set of Android APIs and\nbuild files for the [Tesseract OCR][tesseract-ocr] and [Leptonica][leptonica] \nimage processing libraries.\n\nThis project works with:\n\n - Tesseract 3.05\n - Leptonica 1.74.1\n - libjpeg 9b\n - libpng 1.6.25\n \nThe source code for these dependencies is included within the\n`tess-two/jni` folder. \n\nThe `tess-two` module contains tools for compiling the Tesseract and Leptonica\nlibraries for use on the Android platform. It provides a Java API for accessing \nnatively-compiled Tesseract and Leptonica APIs.\n\nThe `eyes-two` module contains additional image processing code copied from the\n[eyes-free project][eyes-free]. It includes native functions for text detection,\nblur detection, optical flow detection, and thresholding. Eyes-two is not needed\nfor using the Tesseract or Leptonica APIs.\n\nThe `tess-two-test` module contains instrumented unit tests for tess-two.\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\n* Android 2.3 or higher\n* A v3.04 [trained data file][tessdata] for a language. Data files must be \ncopied to the Android device in a subdirectory named `tessdata`.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use tess-two from your app, edit your app module's `build.gradle` file to add \ntess-two as an external dependency:\n\n\tdependencies {\n\t    implementation 'com.rmtheis:tess-two:9.1.0'\n\t}\n\t\n[Javadoc][javadoc] is available.\n\n## Building\n\nIf you want to modify the tess-two code, or you want to use the eyes-two module,\nyou may build the project yourself locally. See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).\n\n\n## Versions\n\nRelease points are tagged with [version numbers][semantic-versioning]. A change \nto the major version number indicates an API change making that version \nincompatible with previous versions.\n\nThe [change log](CHANGELOG.md) shows what's new in each version.\n\n## Support\n\n* Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tess-two\n* tesseract-ocr: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tesseract-ocr\n\n## License\n\n    Copyright 2011 Robert Theis\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n## See Also\n\nThe Google Mobile Vision API team has made available an OCR capability that is\nprovided to developers through the Google Play Services library: The\n[Mobile Vision API][mobile-vision-api] offers a simple API for OCR that\ncurrently works for Latin-based characters.\n\n[tesseract-android-tools]: https://github.com/alanv/tesseract-android-tools\n[tesseract-ocr]: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract\n[leptonica]: https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica\n[eyes-free]: https://github.com/rmtheis/eyes-free\n[tessdata]: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/tree/3.04.00\n[javadoc]: https://rmtheis.github.io/tess-two/javadoc/index.html\n[semantic-versioning]: http://semver.org\n[stackoverflow]: https://stackoverflow.com/\n[mobile-vision-api]: https://developers.google.com/vision/\n"
