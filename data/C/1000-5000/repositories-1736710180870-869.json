For certain object types, you can double-click on it or use the \"Properties...\" toolbar button to get more information, such as description, attributes, resource usage etc. WinObjEx64 let you view and edit object-related security information if you have required access rights.\n\n# System Requirements\n\nWinObjEx64 does not require administrative privileges. However administrative privilege is required to view much of the namespace and to edit object-related security information.\n\nWinObjEx64 works only on the following x64 Windows: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10/11, including Server variants.\n\n\n# Features\n\n<details>\n  <summary>View list</summary>\n\n- Explore all of Windows Object Manager namespace\n\t- Hierarchical objects

This feature require driver support enabled, see \"Driver support\" part below.\n2. This may require administrator privileges.\n3. Most of additional Windows internals-specific features however will be unavailable due to obvious reasons.\n4. Some named pipes may require administrator privileges to access.\n\n### Driver support\n\nWinObjEx64 supports two types of driver helpers:\n\n1. Helper for read-only access to the kernel memory. Default version uses Kernel Local Debugging Driver (KLDBGDRV) from WinDbg. In order to use it (and thus enable all the above features) Windows must be booted in the debug mode (bcdedit -debug on) and WinObjEx64 must be run with administrator privileges. If you are using WinObjEx64 version with custom helper driver - Windows debug mode is not required. There are exist several drivers that can be used as helpers for WinObjEx64, by default it has only WinDbg type built-in.\n2. Helper to access object handles. WinObjEx64 (any variant) support Process Explorer driver of version 1.5.2 to open process/threads. To enable this just load Process Explorer with administrator privileges simultaneously with WinObjEx64.\n\nAll driver helpers require WinObjEx64 to be run with administrative privileges.\n\n</details>\n\n# Build \n\nWinObjEx64 comes with full source code.\nIn order to build from source you need Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and later versions.\n\n## Instructions\n\n* Select Platform ToolSet first for project in solution you want to build (Project->Properties->General): \n  * v140 for Visual Studio 2015; \n  * v141 for Visual Studio 2017;\n  * v142 for Visual Studio 2019;\n  * v143 for Visual Studio 2022.\n* For v140 and above set Target Platform Version (Project->Properties->General):\n  * If v140 then select 8.1;\n  * If v141 and above then select 10.\n* Minimum required Windows SDK version 8.1\n* Recommended Windows SDK version 10.0.19041 and above\n \n \n# What is new\n\n[Whats New in 2.0.0](https://github.com/hfiref0x/WinObjEx64/blob/master/Compiled/WHATSNEW_200.md)\n\n[Complete changelog](https://github.com/hfiref0x/WinObjEx64/blob/master/Source/CHANGELOG.txt)\n\n# Authors\n\n\n(c) 2015 - 2024 WinObjEx64 Project, hfiref0x\n\nOriginal WinObjEx (c) 2003 - 2005 Four-F\n"
