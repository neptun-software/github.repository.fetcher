By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

          "content": "\n Irssi installation instructions\n -------------------------------\n\nTo compile Irssi you need:\n\n- meson-0.53 build system with ninja-1.8 or greater\n- pkg-config (or compatible)\n- glib-2.32 or greater\n- openssl (for ssl support)\n- perl-5.8 or greater (for building, and optionally Perl scripts)\n- terminfo or ncurses (for text frontend)\n\nFor most people, this should work just fine:\n\n meson Build\n ninja -C Build\n su\n ninja -C Build install\n \nmeson options\n\n  These options can be given to meson.\n  \n  For a complete list of options, run\n   meson configure\n\n  --prefix\n\n  Specifies the path where Irssi will be installed.\n  YES, you can install Irssi WITHOUT ROOT permissions\n  by using --prefix=/home/dir\n\n  -Dwith-proxy=yes\n\n  Build the Irssi proxy (see startup-HOWTO).\n\n  -Dwith-perl=[yes|no]\n\n  Enable Perl support\n  yes    enable builtin (default)\n  no     disable\n\n  -Dwith-perl-lib=[site|vendor|DIR]\n\n  Specify installation dir for Perl libraries\n  site   install in dir for site-specific modules (default)\n  vendor install in dir for vendor-specific modules\n  DIR    install in DIR\n\n  -Dwith-bot=yes\n\n  Build irssi-bot\n\n  -Dwithout-textui=yes\n\n  Build without text frontend\n\nIf anything is in non-standard path, you can just give the paths in\nthe -Dc_args and -Dc_link_args options variable, eg.:\n\n  meson Build -Dc_args='-I/opt/openssl/include' -Dc_link_args='-L/opt/openssl/lib'\n\n\n\n Perl problems\n -------------\n\nPerl support generates most of the problems. There's quite a many\nthings that can go wrong:\n\n - If there's any weird crashing at startup, you might have older irssi's\n   perl libraries installed somewhere, and you should remove those.\n - If meson complains that it doesn't find some perl stuff, you're\n   probably missing libperl.so or libperl.a. In debian, you'll need to do\n   apt-get install libperl-dev\n\nYou can verify that the perl module is loaded and working with \"/LOAD\"\ncommand. It should print something like:\n\nModule               Type    Submodules\n...\nperl                 dynamic fe core\n\n\n System specific notes\n ---------------------\n\n Android\n\nWhen cross compiling Irssi for Android, you can specify the path of\nthe cross-perl in the cross file.\n\nYou may not have a cross-perl available.

By Shivaram Lingamneni\n\n\t* The display system now renders formats on the fly (#1079,\n\t  #1188, #1191, #1192, #1204, #1205, #1209, #1349, #1355,\n\t  an#13, an#14, an#28, an#29, an#36, an#37, an#49)\n\n\t  This major change will break scripts that try to modify\n\t  printed text during \"print text\" signal (#1189). They need\n\t  to be ported to modify the text during \"print format\"\n\t  instead. It also breaks the usage of using /FORMAT to add\n\t  different colours to a line. Such usage needs to be ported\n\t  to using $expando variables instead. Affected scripts\n\t  include format_identify.pl, friends_peder.pl, nickcolor.pl,\n\t  nm.pl, people.pl\n\n\t  The \"gui print text finished\" and \"gui print text after\n\t  finished\" signals gained a TEXT_DEST_REC *parameter in the\n\t  process.\n\n\t  A new \"gui render line text\" signal is available to change\n\t  the rendering of a line\n\n\t* made the $Z expando (time) dynamic (#1087, #1207, #1208)\n\n\t  This change breaks the usage of /SET timestamp_format to\n\t  supply a custom displayed time stamp. Affected scripts\n\t  include binary_time.pl\n\n\t* /HILIGHT -priority now affects which hilight rule gets\n\t  applied (#1228, #1232)\n\t* The NAMES list is now hidden by default if there are more\n\t  than 18 users on the channel (an#7)\n\n\t  To revert to the previous behaviour\n\n\t      /SET show_names_on_join_limit -1\n\n\t* -tls_verify is now enabled by default (#1170, an#18, #1309,\n           an#23, #1343, #1351)\n\n\t  This may cause an ugly display of notls_verify in the output\n\t  of /SERVER LIST, even on plain-text connection, on old\n\t  configs. Kindly remove the \"tls_verify = \"no\";\" entries from\n\t  your config file manually.\n\n\t* Irssi will now attempt STARTTLS if advertised (#1170, #1312,\n\t  an#19)\n\n\t  Use -disallow_starttls if you absolutely do not want this\n\n\t  In order to check for a STARTTLS advertisement, Irssi will\n\t  now wait for a response (even an error) to CAP LS 302. If\n\t  your bouncer/server does not want to communicate before\n\t  receiving USER/PASS at all, use -nocap to disable the CAP\n\t  check.\n\n\t* Channel sync requests (WHO, MODE) are now sent \"later\" than\n          user commands. This should improve responsiveness to user\n          commands in the autojoin phase (#1300, an#26, an#32, an#33)\n\t* Irssi is now using full paths in #include directives and\n          consequently does not add all directories to the include\n          path anymore (#1040)\n\t* The Build System was ported to Meson (#1064, #1065, #1068,\n\t  #1071, #1072, #1073, #1074, #1075, #1084, #1085, #1118, #1166,\n\t  #1223, #1224, #1245, #1313, #1314, an#31)\n\t* Scriptassist was changed to use a YAML database (#1163)\n\n\t  It will tell you when you need to update your setting\n\n\t* /BIND shows all partial matches (#1155)\n\t* Cleanup of unused functions (#1017, #1132, #1145, #1182,\n\t  #1246, #1264)\n\n\t  Functions removed:\n\n\t      NET_CALLBACK\n\t      NET_HOST_CALLBACK\n\t      RESOLVED_NAME_REC\n\t      net_gethostbyaddr_nonblock\n\t      net_connect_nonblock\n\t      [ SIMPLE_THREAD_REC, simple_init, simple_readpipe ]\n\t      hash_save_key\n\n\t  Functions deprecated:\n\n\t      dec2octal\n\t      g_timeval_cmp\n\t      get_timeval_diff\n\n\t  Function names corrected:\n\n\t      g_input -> i_input\n\t      g_istr -> i_istr\n\t      g_io_channel -> i_io_channel\n\t      g_hash_free_value -> i_hash_free_value\n\t      remove g_free_true\n\t      gslist -> i_slist\n\t      glog_func -> i_log_func\n\t      glist -> i_list\n\n\t  If multi-version compatibility is desired, module authors\n\t  can find an example of backwards compatible code in\n\t  cdidier/irssi-xmpp#55\n\n\t+ Add MSGLEVEL_HIDDEN to Perl (#1044)\n\t+ Add $view->set_hidden_level and $view->remove_lines_by_level\n\t  to Perl (#1026)\n\t+ Add a /SET scrollback_max_age setting (#1022).

(by Matt Sparks, bug #667)\n\t+ Show new Charybdis +q list in channel windows (numerics 728 and 729).\n\t+ Allow servers to belong to multiple networks.\n\t+ Improve paste detection. Irssi now detects a paste if it reads at\n\t  least three bytes in a single read; subsequent reads are associated to\n\t  the same paste if they happen before 'paste_detect_time' time since\n\t  the last read. If no read occurs after 'paste_detect_time' time the\n\t  paste buffer is flushed; if there is at least one complete line its\n\t  content is sent as a paste, otherwise it is processed normally.\n\t+ Show \"target changing too fast\" messages in the channel/query window.\n\t+ Use default trusted CAs if nothing is specified. This allows useful\n\t  use of -ssl_verify without -ssl_cafile/-ssl_capath, using OpenSSL's\n\t  default trusted CAs.\n\t+ Show why an SSL certificate failed validation.\n\t+ Make own nick and actions use default colour instead of white\n\t  (by Tim Retout).\n\t- Change some characters illegal in Windows filenames to underscores in\n\t  logs\n\t- Fix disconnects when sending large amounts of data over SSL\n\t- Show all nicks instead of just the first in an /accept * listing\n\t  (Bug #704)\n\t- Make several signals without parameters available to perl again.\n\t  In particular, this includes the \"beep\" signal\n\t  (by Matt Sparks, bug #674)\n\t- Close the config file fd after saving (by Sven Wegener)\n\t- Check if an SSL certificate matches the hostname of the server we are\n\t  connecting to.\n\t- Fix bash'isms, use command -v instead of which and use bc -l in /CALC.\n\t- Fix a crash with handling the DCC queue.\n\t- Fix crash when checking for fuzzy nick match when not on the channel.\n\t  Reported by Aurelien Delaitre (SATE 2009).\n\nv0.8.14 2009-07-28  The Irssi team <staff@irssi.org>\n\t+ Make /reset an alias for /set -default.\n\t+ Make /unset an alias for /set -clear.\n\t+ Allow ctrl+home / ctrl+end to go to the beginning / end of scrollback.\n\t+ Accept WHOX reply (354 numeric) as a /who reply.\n\t+ Show numerics directed at channels in the channel window.\n\t+ The time duration parser is more strict now.\n\t- Fix out of bounds access in event_wallops().\n\t- Build fix for OS X.\n\t- Fix the autolog_ignore_targets logic to work correctly with manually\n\t  opened log files (see bug #673).\n\nv0.8.13 2009-04-01  The Irssi team <staff@irssi.org>\n\t+ Reject some obviously invalid values in /set.\n\t+ Add perl bindings for Window::get_history_lines\n\t+ Use an io channel to write the config file.\n\t+ Use memory slices instead of memory chunks for text buffer.\n\t+ Remove methods to create/destroy TextBuffer and TextBufferView and low level\n\t  api to add/remove lines, scripts should be fine using Window::print_after and\n\t  TextBufferView::remove_line.\n\t+ Add print_after method to Window perl object analogous to\n\t  gui_printtext_after but which also expands formats and forces a full line.\n\t+ Better mapping of signal parameters to Perl. All signals used in scripts\n\t  now need to be registered with Irssi::signal_register.\n\t+ Add public header with interfaces to manage statusbar items (bug #535)\n\t+ Recode: assume utf-8 encoding for an ascii string in which no escape\n\t  character occurs (bug #392).\n\t+ Allow /BAN, /UNBAN, /KICKBAN, /KNOCKOUT if channel is not synced.\n\t  Requesting ban lists from an unsynced channel will ask\n\t  them from the server, banning a user whose u@h irssi\n\t  does not know will ban nick!*@* and only bans irssi\n\t  knows about can be removed.\n\t+ Allow storing multiple \"other\" prefixes such as +q and +a (original patch\n\t  by JasonX)\n\t+ Add /set autolog_ignore_targets for cherry-picking targets that shouldn't\n\t  get logged.\n\t+ Add support for 16 colors. Formats KBGCRMYW and mirc colors are now\n\t  mapped to colors 8-15. fe-text translates colors 8-15 to bold/blink+0-7\n\t  if the terminal supports only 8 colors. If your theme uses one of\n\t  the high color formats and you really want bold you can change\n\t  %FMT<string> to %fmt%_<string>%_, it will work fine in all irssi versions.\n\t+ Better 005 PREFIX support (bug #580).\n\t+ Display 407 numerics other than \"duplicate channel\".\n\t+ Fix display of ratbox-style operspy whois.\n\t+ Recode outgoing irc away messages (bug #412).\n\t+ Recode outgoing irc quit messages.\n\t+ Remove scrollback_levelclear_levels setting and add a 'level' option\n\t  to 'sb levelclear' to specify a comma separated list of levels.\n\t+ Add perl __WARN__ handler for scripts (bug #427).\n\t+ Add Irssi::command_parse_options function to parse options for a command.\n\t+ Revert recode changes introduced in 0.8.12.\n\t+ Add completion for /WINDOW SERVER.\n\t+ Support for reading kicks/msgs from TARGMAX/MAXTARGETS 005 tokens.\n\t+ Enhancements to the redirections code.\n\t+ Support for RPL_WHOISACTUALLY (338 numeric) for both ratbox and ircu\n\t  (bug #428).\n\t+ -idle option of /notify is gone.\n\t+ /layout save now makes window-channel bindings instantly effective\n\t  (bug #35).\n\t+ /ping without arguments does not send anymore a ctcp ping to a channel\n\t  (bug #542).\n\t+ Track IRC operator status of nicks a bit better.\n\t+ new 'actlist_names' option to add active items names in 'act'\n\t  statusbar item.\n\t+ new 'word_completion_backward' command to scroll backwards in the\n\t  completion list.\n\t+ add 'list' option to /bind to print all the available commands.\n\t+ show setter/time in +I lists\n\t+ apply -usermode before -autosendcmd (bug #548).\n\t+ reduce memory usage of the scrollback buffer and make the display\n\t  in /sb status more accurate (higher).\n\t+ fix data getting dropped when a lot is sent at a time (e.g. when\n\t  attaching to irssi-proxy, bug #528).\n\t+ introduce the type Irssi::Irc::Client and signals to communicate with\n\t  proxy clients to allow for scripting parts of the irssi-proxy.\n\t+ Add sb_search.pl, a script for /SCROLLBACK SEARCH\n\t- Fix /NOTIFY list when nick is seen joining (bug #642).\n\t- Include hostmask in 001 event sent by proxy (bug #650).\n\t- Be more power-friendly: don't run any always-on <1s timers (bug #641).\n\t- Don't get confused by a failed /JOIN -window (bug #644).\n\t- Properly initialize embedded Perl (PERL_SYS_INIT3).\n\t- Replace invalid utf-8 bytes with U+FFFD when drawing a line.\n\t- Properly unload the original script when using /script load to reload it.\n\t  (bug #525, patch by Lukas Mai)\n\t- Clean up script loading in general:\n\t   * Don't leak local variables to eval'd code.\n\t   * Set filename/line number to get better error messages from perl.\n\t   * Use three-arg open and lexical filehandles to avoid surprises.\n\t   * Include error reason in message for unopenable scripts.\n\t   * Don't wrap script code in sub handler { } - this avoids spurious warnings and\n\t     should at least allow __END__ to work properly.\n\t  (Patch by Lukas Mai)\n\t- Fix NETSPLIT_SERVER_REC in signals for Perl.\n\t- Remove buggy /SCROLLBACK redraw and /SET scrollback_save_formats.\n\t- Always preserve the active mainwindow when resizing.\n\t- Ignore DNS not found errors when considering reconnect.\n\t- Do not strip the comma in a mirc color if it is not followed by a digit (bug #250).\n\t- Fix building perl module with perl-5.10 (bug #630).\n\t- fix leak with $L expando.\n\t- fix possible crash with /script reset.\n\t- ignore exceptions take precedence over ignores in all cases.\n\t- honour -channels preference for ignore -replies (bug #227).\n\t- Fix mode display in whois with unreal (379 numeric) (bug #479).\n\t- Fix regressions that prevented external modules from building/working\n\t  (bugs #537 #539).\n\t- Fix /set hilight_level not taking effect immediately (bug #598).\n\t- Fix bold, blinking and indentation in /LASTLOG and buf.pl.\n\nv0.8.12 2007-10-06  The Irssi team <staff@irssi.org>\n\t+ Some changes to character set recoding.\n\t+ Rewrite SSL connection/handshake code.\n\t+ Remove support for glib 1.x.\n\t+ Do not send our hostname to the server (bug #488).\n\t+ Add $tag to 'window' item in default configuration.\n\t+ Pick up host changes on charybdis and ircu servers (396 numeric).\n\t+ Show various errors such as \"cannot send to channel\" and \"cannot\n\t  /msg, user is +g\" in the channel or query window, if possible,\n\t  and always include the user or channel name.\n\t+ Channel forwarding in hyperion and charybdis is now recognized\n\t  (470 numeric) and the target channel is joined in the window where\n\t  the original channel would have been joined.\n\t+ Add support for the ACCEPT command, which is part of the CALLERID\n\t  server side ignore system in hybrid7 and derived ircds.\n\t+ Make /WINDOW GOTO start searching at the window after the active\n\t  one and stop at the one before (bug #332).\n\t+ Improve completion for /SET.\n\t+ Use CASEMAPPING dependent comparison to match channel names.\n\t  Patch by Jon Mayo (bug #436).\n\t+ Various improvements to the help files.\n\t+ Add Perl bindings for some gui_entry methods\n\t+ Make alt/meta+arrow keys work in recent versions of xterm (bug #496)\n\t- Fix DCC get when file size is 0 (bug #494).\n\t- Ignore empty lines when pasting.\n\t- Fix large file support on AIX (bug #404).\n\t- Remove broken code that prevents unloading of a script in some cases.\n\t- Fix logging lines with no target to all logs, broken in 0.8.11.\n\t- Fix casemapping dependent nick and channel matching (bug #436).\n\t- Update chanop flag before emitting nick mode changed signal (patch\n\t  by Johan Kiviniemi)\n\t- Fix recognition of realnames starting with spaces in /WHO.\n\t- Show \"Target left IRC\" error messages fully (instead of reporting\n\t  no such nick \"*\")\n\t- Repair channels_rejoin_unavailable.

The units can be combined and written\n\t      in shorter form as well, for example \"5d 30m 10ms\"\n\t    - Size settings can have units: gbytes, mbytes, kbytes, bytes.\n\t      They can be written in shorter form as well, eg. \"gb\" or \"g\".\n\n\t  Your existing settings should be converted automatically.\n\n\t+ Pasting detection. All keys except CR and LF are pasted as-is into\n\t  prompt in pasting mode.\n\n\t  /SET paste_detect_time controls how closely each others characters\n\t  must occur for it to be considered pasting. Paste mode goes on when\n\t  first pasted CR/LF is found.\n\n\t  The first line may also contain some command characters. They are\n\t  executed, but their action in entry line is reverted once pasting\n\t  is detected.\n\n\t  What this means in practise is that even if you have TABs (assuming\n\t  TAB is completion key) in the first pasted line, they get pasted as\n\t  TABs.\n\n\t  This detection isn't perfect, so if it annoys you it can be disabled\n\t  with /SET paste_detect_time 0\n\t+ If pasting more lines than /SET paste_verify_line_count, irssi asks\n\t  if you actually want to do that. This should be useful to prevent\n\t  accidental copy&paste mistakes. Setting it to 0 disables this\n\t  entirely.\n\t+ Support for sending SSL certificate to server and optionally verify\n\t  server's certificate. See the -ssl_* options for /SERVER and\n\t  /SERVER ADD. Patch by Joel Eriksson.\n\t+ DCC SERVER support by Mark Trumbull\n\t+ Support for DCC sending larger files than 2GB if supported by\n\t  operating system (ie. 64bit file support). Receiving has always\n\t  been possible, but the statistics were wrong with >4GB files\n\t  if 64bit support isn't enabled.\n\t+ Better displaying of DCC file transfer statistics.\n\t- Several other minor fixes and enhancements, see ChangeLog\n\nv0.8.6 2002-11-17  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Tons of changes, here's only the largest that come to my mind now:\n\n\t+ SSL support by vjt@users.sf.net\n\t+ DCC send queues by Heikki Orsila\n\t+ Better support for !channels\n\nv0.8.4 2002-03-13  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Continuing to fix my stupid mistakes...\n\n\t- When a queried nick did a nick change, it might have crashed irssi\n\t- read ChangeLog for some other minor changes\n\nv0.8.3 2002-03-13  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t- Perl scripts handling channel parts/kicks/quits printed some\n\t  errors.\n\t- Connecting to IPv6 servers without IPv4 record didn't work\n\t- When queries were auto-created by you using /MSG and you had\n\t  /SET autoclose_query non-zero, the query was always destroyed\n\t  almost immediately.\n\t- Fix to some stupid ircds not sending us 001 numeric, but\n\t  beginning from MOTD\n\nv0.8.2 2002-03-11  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Changed the list of scripts distributed with irssi. Separated\n\t  example scripts to scripts/examples/ directory.\n\n\t* Hated infobar was removed, the same info is now in topicbar in\n\t  empty windows. I don't think it would disturb anyone in there.\n\t  If you still preferred always-empty topicbars, use\n\t  /SBAR topic REMOVE topic_empty\n\n\t+ Added info_eol field to theme. If true, timestamp and server tag\n\t  are added to end of line, not at beginning.\n\t+ If -4 or -6 option is used with /SERVER, irssi now forces the\n\t  connection using the given protocol or fails.\n\t+ /SET max_wildcard_modes (default 6) - if a wildcard to /OP, /DEOP,\n\t  /VOICE or /DEVOICE matches more nicks than this, -yes option is\n\t  required. This is trying to prevent accidental massops. Setting\n\t  it to 0 disables this check.\n\t+ Supports now correctly servers which use '.' char as channel owner\n\t  character in /NAMES list. Also supports multiple mode chars, eg.\n\t  @+nick (if some server actually used it).\n\t+ Never ignore kick message if you get kicked from channel.\n\t+ Sending irssi SIGHUP now does a /RELOAD - useful if you\n\t  accidentally messed up something which doesn't let you do the\n\t  /RELOAD inside irssi (eg. /SBAR prompt DISABLE).\n\t+ irssi-proxy: PROXY CTCP ON|OFF - proxy clients can send this\n\t  command to specify that they want to handle the received CTCP\n\t  requests. Useful for specifying who gets to handle DCCs.\n\t+ Added escape_char /BIND command. The next char after that would be\n\t  added as-is to input line.\n\t- Writing lines longers than 1024 chars to input buffer crashed\n\t  irssi (stupid missing sizeof() bug :)\n\t- Some UTF-8 fixes\n\t- Better flood protection for lines with >100 chars\n\t- Control characters aren't printed as-is in topicbar (or statusbars\n\t  in general) anymore\n\t- /OPER can be now aborted by giving empty password\n\t- Netjoin messages were buggy in +channels\n\t- Part message parameter for /CYCLE was never used.\n\t- Don't send -autosendcmd after /UPGRADE.\n\t- /SET autoclose_query - now only last received private message\n\t  affects when the query is closed, ie. /WHOIS requests or nick\n\t  changes don't reset the counter.\n\t- Foreground ANSI colors weren't working\n\t- Deleting one character replaced cutbuffer with that character.\n\t  Also ^Y leaked memory.\n\t- /SCRIPT LOAD looked scripts from prefix/lib dir, not prefix/share\n\t  where they were actually installed.\n\t- Highascii chars in replaces block in theme files could have\n\t  crashed irssi.\n\nv0.8.1 2002-02-17  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Expected bugfix release :) Worst thing was that I forgot always to\n\t  debug why /cat /dev/urandom crashed irssi. Well, found two ways\n\t  that could make it happen.\n\n\t- Irssi was linked with -lcurses AND -lncurses\n\t- Logging could have produced GLib errors with certain conditions\n\t- A few compiler warnings fixes\n\nv0.8.0 2002-02-17  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* I really should make releases more often. Once in every two weeks\n\t  used to be nice. Maybe once in a month would be good now. There\n\t  was many reasons why this release took this long .. first being\n\t  addicted to books, then life stuff, then it took forever to figure\n\t  out that irssi was crashing under solaris (and not because of one\n\t  of the big changes I made while moving to IRC from solaris box).\n\n\t  And now.. well, after this release I'll start working more with\n\t  the yet another irssi rewrite :) The code is getting too ugly\n\t  again, and some things need rewriting to support some new features\n\t  more easily. It will take a while to get it all done, so I'll try\n\t  to keep updating this \"stable\" irssi as well.\n\n\t  There's too many changes since 0.7.98.3 (and .4 which was just\n\t  minor bugfix), about 6600 lines in ChangeLog. I'm not going to\n\t  read all that, so I'll just list the biggest changes that I can\n\t  remember now.\n\n\t  This version was supposed to be called 0.7.99, but since there\n\t  were so many changes, and I originally though of putting 0.8.0\n\t  out long time ago, and 0.7.100 would look stupid, I guess it's\n\t  time for 0.8.0 :)\n\n\t+ /UPGRADE - upgrade irssi to new version on-the-fly without\n\t  disconnecting from server, so other people won't even notice you\n\t  quit from IRC. This ONLY executes the new binary, it does NOT\n\t  download/compile/whatever irssi.\n\t+ UTF-8 support with /SET term_type UTF-8, default is \"8bit\".\n\t  It's also automatically detected from system locale (if supported).\n\t+ Fully configurable statusbar. Yes. FULLY. Don't bother asking if\n\t  something could be done with it, it can, just ask how. Well,\n\t  there's a few things I didn't have time/energy to finish:\n\t  window-specific statusbar groups and support for multiple input\n\t  lines in screen.\n\t+ Rewritten keyboard handling. No more the CTRL-X and ALT-x handling,\n\t  now you can create whatever keyboard combinations your terminal\n\t  can send to irssi.\n\t+ Rewritten text buffer (scrollback) handling.\n\t+ Irssi doesn't depend on curses anymore, so it can be installed\n\t  anywhere a working terminfo/termcap exists. This also allows us to\n\t  use all the possible colors terminal has (curses limits to 64), so\n\t  eg. %0 is now always black background, not the default terminal\n\t  background (%n).\n\n\t  Several systems have also terminfo/termcap database that doesn't\n\t  support colors, so I've added /SET term_force_colors option to\n\t  force ANSI-style colors. Note that eg. BitchX does this by default.\n\n\t  Getting rid of curses allows also one great thing for you people\n\t  copy&pasting long urls :) If a long word gets split to two lines,\n\t  doubleclicking the word selects it from both lines.\n\t+ Rewritten server event redirections. Before it was pretty easy to\n\t  mess up irssi's expectations of what server sends, and some things\n\t  might have stayd in the buffer forever. Especially notify lists\n\t  messed up /WHOIS requests for the notified people. Now all this\n\t  should be history and it's a lot easier for scripts to use the\n\t  redirections as well.\n\t+ New ICB chat protocol plugin - very basic and doesn't support\n\t  nicklist, but works. :)\n\t+ --home and --config parameters to specify alternate ~/.irssi\n\t  directory or config file.\n\t+ Scripts can be unloaded separately with /SCRIPT UNLOAD. You can get\n\t  a list of runnning scripts with /SCRIPT.\n\t+ /SERVER PURGE [<target>] - purge the output buffer (for given\n\t  target). Useful for example if you accidentally paste 100 lines :)\n\t  The buffer is automatically purged if you get kicked from channel,\n\t  or if you /PART the channel and there's more than 10 lines in\n\t  output buffer.\n\nv0.7.98.3 2001-03-17  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Highlighting changes: /HILIGHT -color, /SET hilight_color and\n\t  /SET hilight_act_color don't accept the numeric color value\n\t  anymore, the colors must be the %code format (see the beginning\n\t  of docs/formats.txt). The color can also have background and\n\t  underline/blinking set (%F%Y = blinking yellow)\n\n\t* Statusbar rewrite: Statusbar should finally work well when\n\t  there's not enough space for it in screen. Least important items\n\t  start shrinking/disappearing before more important ones, activity\n\t  list should be always fully visible now.\n\n\t  /SET statusbar_xxx settings have been removed, everything is\n\t  configurable from theme now. Even the texts in the statusbar\n\t  items. See end of default.theme.\n\n\t  FULLY configurable statusbar with possibility to create your own\n\t  items and support for multiple lines will hopefully come soon.\n\n\t+ /WINDOW CLOSE [<first> [<last>] - you can close multiple\n\t  windows at once now.\n\t+ Emphasis work with actions now\n\t+ If there's any unknown settings in your configuration file, irssi\n\t  asks at startup if they should be removed.\n\t+ All abstracts in theme files now default to same as in\n\t  default.theme, so you may override only those you want to change\n\t  leaving the rest commented out.\n\t- Irssi crashed when specifying vhost to use (not always?)\n\t- Fixed one nasty usage of already free'd memory. Hopefully solves\n\t  some weird crashes?\n\t- Some perl fixes, Irssi::Nick and \"massjoin\" signal didn't work\n\t  properly which broke all auto-op scripts.\n\t- If one server fails because of DNS error, don't stop reconnecting\n\t  to entire chatnet.\n\t- Updated default config to have max_query_chans=1 in undernet to\n\t  avoid those channel syncing problems.\n\t- /SERVER didn't autojoin channels if it was used when you weren't\n\t  connected to any other servers\n\t- /CONNECT -ircnet didn't load ircnet specific settings correctly\n\t- /SET scroll_page_count - don't crash if /0 is given. Works now\n\t  properly if /0.xx is given.\n\t- ^O did reset only colors, not underlines etc.\n\t- Several fixes with handling blinking text\n\t- Irssi crashed almost immediately with NetBSD/Alpha, fixed. Still\n\t  not sure if it was compiler bug or is my code just non-standard C.\n\t- Reconnecting in IPv6 server shouldn't change to IPv4\n\t- Irssi proxy didn't work properly with systems where irssi was\n\t  compiled with --enable-ipv6 but OS didn't support IPv6\n\nv0.7.98.2 2001-03-04  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t+ /LASTLOG: added -case option for case-sensitive matching.\n\t  -force option is now required to print lastlogs longer than\n\t  1000 lines.\n\t+ /BANTYPE -> /SET ban_type. /BAN: -type option added to override\n\t  default ban type.\n\t+ /NAMES: -ops -halfops -voices -normal options added.\n\t  /NAMES without parameters now prints nicklist in active channel,\n\t  /NAMES ** shows all nicks in all channels.\n\t+ delete_next_word key implemented, patch by Tinuk\n\t+ /SET beep_when_window_active - works with /SET beep_msg_level,\n\t  should we beep when the msg is printed to active window. If msg\n\t  is printed to some other window it always beeps.\n\t+ /JOIN #channel and /QUERY nick won't anymore automatically move\n\t  channel/query to active window but send a notice to user how to\n\t  move it. This was confusing people who did it accidentally.\n\t+ /SET autostick_split_windows (default ON) - should we do\n\t  /WINDOW STICK ON to all new split windows and hidden windows that\n\t  are created inside it. This hopefully makes it easier to use split\n\t  windows.\n\t- All IPv6 problems are hopefully fixed. Everything now keeps both\n\t  v4 and v6 addresses in memory and at connect() time it's decided\n\t  which one should be used.\n\t- /IGNORE * level printed GLib error. /RELOADing printed some\n\t  unignore texts. Autoignores had some problems.\n\t- Using /LAYOUT SAVE with split windows crashed irssi at startup\n\t  when it tried to restore them..\n\t- /WINDOW SHOW command didn't work properly\n\t- /LAST -clear crashed if window contained only lastlog lines.\n\t  Beeping after /LAST -clear also could have crashed.\n\t- HILIGHT level didn't work with logs.\n\t- /SET prompt - if $T (target) had %c or something in it, it\n\t  shouldn't be treated as color code. So color codes can now be\n\t  used in /SET prompt string itself, but in none of the $variables\n\t  it uses.\n\t- Generated help files had joined lines in chapter together but\n\t  didn't add spaces between lines.\n\t- Statusbar could have gotten to endless loop when trying to give\n\t  more space to some item when there was no more available space.\n\t- When /SET autoclose_windows is ON, don't destroy windows if they\n\t  have some level set (like /join -w + /part in status window)\n\t- If GLIB was unpacked to irssi directory, make install tried to\n\t  install it also.\n\t- Always save theme to ~/.irssi/ no matter where it was read from.\n\t- If /SET names_max_width was too low, irssi crashed\n\t- /CONNECT -ircnet \"\" - even if someone does this don't make the\n\t  server tag empty :)\n\t- /QUERYing #channel that was already /JOINed crashed irssi after\n\t  a while\n\t- /SET -clear printed GLib error when done to boolean settings\n\nv0.7.98.1 2001-02-22  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t- fixed stupid remote crash with nick_match_msg()\n\nv0.7.98 2001-02-22  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Theme files aren't fully compatible with old ones, there's a few\n\t  naming changes and some new items. Added lots of comments and help\n\t  to default.theme, so creating themes should be a bit easier now :)\n\n\t* Perl scripts aren't compatible with old ones anymore. Biggest\n\t  change is that $object->values()->{xxx} calls are now just\n\t  $object->{xxx}, but there's a lot of other changes as well.\n\t  docs/perl.txt is now up to date so you may want to read it.\n\n\t* Several settings have changed their names:\n\t    /SET beep_on_msg -> beep_msg_level\n\t    /SET activity_levels -> activity_msg_level\n\t    /SET hilight_levels -> activity_hilight_level\n\t    /SET noact_channels -> activity_hide_targets\n\n\t+ /SET prompt, /SET prompt_window - Specifies the text in prompt.\n\t  'prompt' is used when channel or query is active in window and\n\t  'prompt_window' is used with empty windows. You can also use\n\t  % color codes in prompt.\n\t+ /EXEC - rewrote it, has now all the same features as EPIC and a\n\t  few more, like \"interactive shell in window\" support. See\n\t  /HELP exec for information.\n\t+ /SAVEWINDOWS renamed to /LAYOUT SAVE. Added /LAYOUT RESET.\n\t  /LAYOUT SAVE now saves split windows and queries properly.\n\t  Windows that contain saved channels are never used for anything\n\t  else (ie. if the saved channel isn't joined, no other channels\n\t  can be joined to the window)\n\t+ /WINDOW SERVER: added -sticky and -unsticky options. If window\n\t  server is sticky, it will never be automatically changed, and it\n\t  cannot be changed to anything else without -unsticky option.\n\t  Should be useful for people who want status or msgs windows for\n\t  each server.\n\t+ /WINDOW STICK [ON|OFF|<ref#>] - stick window to specified split\n\t  window. After setting window to sticky non-sticky windows can't\n\t  replace the active sticky one. Each split window can have it's own\n\t  sticky window group.\n\t+ /WINDOW LEFT, /WINDOW RIGHT - Go to previous/next window in the\n\t  current sticky window group, or if there's no sticky windows go to\n\t  previous/next non-sticky window. Alt-Left/Right keys default to\n\t  these commands now.\n\t+ /WINDOW NUMBER: -sticky option added. Closing windows before a\n\t  sticky window won't change refnum of the sticky window and windows\n\t  after it.\n\t+ /SET windows_auto_renumber - should window refnums be packed when\n\t  some window is destroyed in the middle\n\t+ /SET scroll_page_count - how many lines to scroll with pgup/pgdn.\n\t  either an absolute value, or if the count starts with '/', it's\n\t  calculated as lines_in_screen/count. The default is /2.\n\t+ /SET timestamp_format specifies the format to use with timestamps\n\t  in \"man strftime\" format.\n\t+ Emphasis (*word*, _word_) replacing works better now. It doesn't\n\t  try to change nicks or any non-words. This time people might want\n\t  to actually use it :)\n\t+ Nick completion logic changes, should work better now. Changed\n\t  meaning of /SET completion_keep_publics to be number of publics\n\t  to keep instead of time to keep them.\n\t+ /HILIGHT: Added -priority option (deciding which color should stay\n\t  in activity list), /SET hilight_level to specify the default level\n\t  for /HILIGHTs. -word option renamed to -full. Added new -word\n\t  option meaning to highlight only the found word in line. Removed\n\t  -nonick option but added -line which means pretty much the same.\n\t  -actcolor specifies what color to show in activity list, default\n\t  is the same as -color or if there's no -color it defaults to\n\t  /SET hilight_act_color. Colors can have background color set with\n\t  fg,bg. Works with activity list too, useful for example blinking.\n\t+ DCC rewrite. File names with spaces work properly, you can have\n\t  multiple dcc chats with same people (or more useful, same nick in\n\t  different ircnets), /DCC CHAT|GET|RESUME with no arguments accepts\n\t  the last request, notifies if dcc request was sent to channel,\n\t  warns about connecting to lowports, /SET dcc_autoget_lowports\n\t  specifies if autogetting should work with lowports, complains of\n\t  invalid DCC CTCPs instead of ignoring, /SET dcc_autoresume is like\n\t  dcc_autoget except resumes the files if possible.\n\t+ /NAMES can print columns with different widths now. You can change\n\t  the max. width with /SET names_max_width and /SET names_max_columns\n\t  settings. Default is max. 6 columns.\n\t+ /LASTLOG: Added options -file <filename> for writing lastlog to\n\t  file, -window <ref#|name> for specifying which window's lastlog to\n\t  print (output is always to active window) and -clear option to\n\t  remove all lastlog lines from window.\n\t+ /OPER [<nick> [<password>]] - syntax changed. If password isn't\n\t  given, it's asked.\n\t+ /FOREACH server|channel|query|window <command>\n\t+ /UNBAN <ref#> works. /BAN list shows reference numbers.\n\t+ /PERL <code> - runs perl code (like /PERL Irssi::print \"hello\")\n\t+ /CLEAR -all - clear all windows\n\t+ /KICKBAN and /KNOCKOUT accepts multiple nicks separated with commas\n\t+ /SET theme - says what theme was changed to, and complains if\n\t  theme wasn't found. Setting theme's name to \"xxx.theme\" now works,\n\t  too many people tried it with the .theme suffix :)\n\t+ /WHOIS without parameters in query does now same as\n\t  /WII <queried nick>\n\t+ IPv6 updates: /CONNECT, /SERVER, /SERVER ADD: added -4 and -6\n\t  options for specifying if we should connect to IPv4 or IPv6 address\n\t  of the server. If -host or /SET hostname is set, irssi determines\n\t  from it if it should use IPv4 or v6. If irssi still isn't sure of\n\t  it, it fallbacks to /SET resolve_prefer_ipv6\n\t+ Logs and rawlogs write to files through special \"write buffer\". By\n\t  default everything gets written immediately, but you can make it\n\t  wait until there's specified amount of data in buffer or write once\n\t  in a hour or so. Useful for people who want to keep hard disk at\n\t  sleep at nights but still want to log. /SET write_buffer_mins and\n\t  /SET write_buffer_kb specifies when to flush the buffer.\n\t  /FLUSHBUFFER flushes it immediately.\n\t+ LOTS of other smaller things that should make your life easier :)\n\t- /SET dcc_autorename OFF didn't work before.\n\t- Irssi compiled with IPv6 support didn't work properly with some\n\t  operating systems.\n\t- Theme saving to home dir didn't work correctly if globaldir\n\t  already had the same theme.\n\t- If log file locking failed, irssi always assumed it was locked\n\t  while it could have been because filesystem didn't support locking\n\t  or some other problem..\n\nv0.7.97 2000-12-03  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Added templates for themes - this allowed separation of the\n\t  actual texts and styling/coloring. See default.theme file for\n\t  more information. You should remove your old ~/.irssi/default.theme\n\t  or at least merge it with the defaul.theme.\n\n\t* If GLIB sources are found unpacked from some subdirectory, always\n\t  compile it and use it even if GLIB is already installed somewhere\n\t  else.\n\n\t+ /SCROLLBACK REDRAW - redraw contents of current window according\n\t  to active formats, ie. changing theme updates the scrollback.\n\t  This requires /SET scrollback_save_formats ON.\n\t+ /SET log_theme <theme> - you can specify what theme to use for\n\t  writing texts to log file.\n\t+ /WAIT [-<server tag>] <milliseconds> - wait for <milliseconds>\n\t  before sending anything else to server\n\t+ /EXEC <command> - execute command and print it's output (stdout\n\t  only) to screen. (by Tinuk)\n\t+ Don't indent the next line when long word is split, this should\n\t  help a bit when copying long URLs.\n\t+ Remember who set the topic and when, display the info when using\n\t  /TOPIC.\n\t+ /SET emphasis - convert _underlined_ and *bold* words (and phrases)\n\t  to use real underlines/bolds. (by tommik)\n\t+ While waiting for more netsplits/netjoins, if anything else is\n\t  printed to screen, print the current netsplit/netjoin messages\n\t  before that text.\n\t+ Print multiple identical mode changes in one line\n\t  (mode +o nick by nick1, nick2, nick3)\n\t+ /WINDOW ITEM GOTO <name> - sets <name> active in current window\n\t+ /WINDOW ITEM MOVE <window#>|<name> - moves window item to another\n\t  window.\n\t+ /SET autocreate_windows - should we create new windows for new\n\t  window items or just place everything to one window\n\t+ /JOIN #already_joined_channel, /QUERY already_queried_nick - same\n\t  as /WINDOW ITEM MOVE <name>\n\t+ /SET activity_level, /SET hilight_level - specifies which message\n\t  levels should be treated as msg/hilight activity. (by tommik)\n\t+ DCC queries are now created automatically only if /SET\n\t  autocreate_query_level has DCCMSGS level\n\t+ If other side replies to our DCC CHAT request with DCC CHAT\n\t  request of their own (maybe we were inside firewall and other\n\t  side noticed it), connect to it immediately.\n\t+ Don't allow more than one identical DCC request, if more is\n\t  received just update the port of the previous request.\n\t+ Added KILL handling - user/server kills are now printed formatted.\n\t+ If server KILLs you, connect back (almost) immediately (don't wait\n\t  for the default 5 minutes)\n\t+ Nick completion now completes nicks from all channels in active\n\t  window, except when completing the first word in line only nicks\n\t  in active channel are completed.\n\t+ /SET show_nickmode_empty - when nick has no mode, should we\n\t  display \" \" or \"\"\n\t+ /SET part_message - default message with /PART\n\t+ Added -current, -window and -level options to /ECHO\n\t+ Ctrl-T = transpose_characters\n\t+ Perl scripting supports now printformat(), ie. user can change\n\t  the text format with /FORMAT just like any other formats.\n\t+ Proxy plugin now supports multiple servers, blocks CTCPs from\n\t  clients behind it and if one client sends message to channel,\n\t  other clients + proxy itself also receives the message.\n\t- Netsplit/netjoin printing fixes. Sometimes netsplits were hidden\n\t  completely and some netjoins were forgotten and printed as normal\n\t  joins instead.\n\t- Lag checking broke sometimes when nick was changed\n\t- Don't close non-autolog logs when leaving channel / closing query.\n\t- Time formats didn't work in directory name of autologs.\n\t- Sometimes join to channel didn't ever get synced.\n\t- IPv6 support didn't work correctly with all non-Linux OSes.\n\t- Lots of minor fixes and changes to make your life easier.\n\nv0.7.96 2000-10-19  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* new configure option: --disable-curses-windows. Use this if curses\n\t  always redraws the window when scrolling. This is a weird problem,\n\t  I'd like to know why it happens. :)\n\t* Log settings are incompatible with previous versions. You'll need\n\t  to setup them again. Or the targets are actually the only ones\n\t  that irssi won't read correctly.\n\t* Lots of moving and cleaning and rewriting stuff from irc to core\n\t  so adding other IRC-like protocols (but not IRC) would be easier.\n\t  This was mostly done to make SILC plugin work.\n\t* Perl was split to Irssi and Irssi::Irc packages. You'll currently\n\t  need to use both of them with perl scripts (\"use Irssi;\n\t  use Irssi::Irc;). This might not be needed in future :)\n\t* Changes:\n\t   - /SET default_nick -> /SET nick\n\t   - /FORMAT own_me -> /FORMAT own_action\n\t   - /FORMAT own_dcc_me -> /FORMAT own_dcc_action\n\n\t+ Small tutorial to new irssi users - docs/startup-HOWTO.txt\n\t+ Proxy plugin works again, thanks to fuchs for fixing it :)\n\t+ You can now connect multiple times to same server and\n\t  reconnections will work correctly with them.\n\t+ Support for half-ops (+h)\n\t+ Actions will now show up in window activity with hilight or\n\t  message-color, not the text-color as before.\n\t+ Added tab-completion for /BIND's commands.\n\t+ Perl support is now built as runtime loadable module by default.\n\t  You can still build it statically with --enable-perl=static\n\t  configure option.\n\t+ /SET completion_nicks_lowercase - when completing nicks always\n\t  write the nick with lowercase (uppercase letters are ugly ;)\n\t+ /BIND <key> /command works now directly instead of needing the\n\t  \"command\" id in the middle\n\t+ /connect + /server server/chatnet completion by tommik.\n\t+ Keyboard should never get stuck again when receiving huge amounts\n\t  of text from server that irssi doesn't handle fast enough.\n\t- Hopefully fixed the problem when Irssi starts eating 100% CPU\n\t- Fixes to make irssi work with other (older and newer) perl\n\t  versions than 5.005\n\t- /MSG -servertag crashed irssi.\n\t- /BAN could crash when showing bans\n\t- log_day_change was never printed in logs\n\t- /mode #channel -oooo... would deop the first 3, and then op the\n\t  rest.\n\t- When pressing down key, the command line wasn't saved to history.\n\t- Closing or moving window didn't update the window activity list.\n\t- Autologging with same named channels in different networks works\n\t  now correctly.\n\nv0.7.95 2000-08-13  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Changes:\n\t    - /LOG: Removed the -rotate option, it was pretty useless since\n\t      adding the % formats to file name already tells that the log\n\t      should be rotated.\n\t    - WJOIN -> /JOIN -window and WQUERY -> /QUERY -window. Added\n\t      WJOIN and WQUERY aliases for them in default config..\n\t+ /SAVEWINDOWS saves the current layout of windows. It's\n\t  automatically reloaded at startup.\n\t+ Theme fixes: /RELOAD reloads them, /SET theme changes the default\n\t  theme, you can have window specific themes with /WINDOW THEME.\n\t+ Irssi uses now real curses windows, irssi should work now better\n\t  with non-ncurseses.\n\t+ Autologging supports log rotating now too, just add the wanted %\n\t  formats to /SET autolog_path\n\t+ /MSG nick completion now gives the nicks in right time order when\n\t  using multiple irc networks.\n\t+ /SET beep_on_msg now works with all message levels, including\n\t  HILIGHT.\n\t+ You can change the default line indentation with /SET indent\n\t+ /channel add -bots: You can now use @ or + before the nick mask to\n\t  indicate that bot should have either ops or voices/ops.\n\t+ Perl scripting:\n\t    - Added namespaces, you don't have to worry about if someone\n\t      else also happens to be using event_privmsg function..\n\t    - You can unload scripts with /UNLOAD <name>.\n\t    - Running scripts that are already loaded, destroys the old\n\t      script from memory.\n\t    - Added Irssi::print_window() function to print text to current\n\t      window.\n\t- Don't autoclose window after part/unquery if there was still some\n\t  channels/queries left in window.\n\t- Autologging fixes: Don't log WHOIS replies by default\n\t  (autolog_level = all -crap). And with /msg nick1,nick2 don't log\n\t  to file nick1,nick2.log but nick1.log and nick2.log separately.\n\t  It also failed if you hadn't created the base path for the logs,\n\t  now irssi creates the whole directory path.\n\nv0.7.94 2000-07-24  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Help files! Use /HELP <command> to see them.\n\t  They're just very first beta versions so don't expect too much.\n\t  They were written by Markus Vuori <mm@vuori.net> with some help\n\t  from EPIC's help files :)\n\n\t* Changes:\n\t   - /SET completion_disable_auto -> completion_auto\n\t   - Changed the names of /BIND commands to be epic-compatible.\n\t     Also added several new commands.\n\t   - If --prefix is used, add the default perl library directory to\n\t     same prefix.\n\t+ Implemented /WINDOW LAST for changing to last current window.\n\t+ Added DCCMSGS message level. Actions match now either MSGS or\n\t  PUBLIC level as well as the ACTIONS level always.\n\t+ SET print_active_channel - if you have multiple channels in same\n\t  window, should we always print the channel for each message\n\t  (<nick:#channel>) or only when the channel isn't active.\n\t+ Don't print nick changes and quit messages from same nick more\n\t  than once in the same window (if you had joined multiple channels\n\t  in same window).\n\t+ /SET settings_autosave - If set ON, settings are automatically\n\t  saved when quitting and once per hour.\n\t+ Don't allow recursive aliases, ie. /alias echo echo hello does\n\t  print hello instead of going to infinite loop.\n\t+ Implemented /IGNORE -time <seconds>, patch by fuchs.\n\t+ /PERLFLUSH now cleans up the Perl interpreter properly (closes\n\t  all the files opened in perl scripts, etc)\n\t- Awaylog didn't work right if you did /AWAY multiple times.\n\t- /NOTIFY -idle sometimes printed the unidle-message even if the\n\t  nick really didn't stop idling. Fixed several other notify list\n\t  bugs.\n\t- Tab-msgcompletion didn't work right after you had used\n\t  /msg -ircnet nick\n\t- Fixed the long standing text buffer bug which could sometimes\n\t  crash irssi if you were unlucky.\n\t- The channel key given in /JOIN should override the one given\n\t  in setup.\n\t- /RELOAD caused several bugs\n\nv0.7.93 2000-07-09  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t+ Implemented /BIND [<key> [<action> [<data>]]] command.\n\t  <key> can be CTRL-x, ALT-X or ALT-SHIFT-X\n\t  The most useful action is \"command\", give the command in <data>.\n\t  You can see the rest of the actions with typing /BIND without\n\t  any parameters. Some actions might have more than one word,\n\t  to use them type the action in \"quotation marks\".\n\t+ When netsplit is over, irssi prints \"Netsplit over, joins: (nicks)\"\n\t  and hides all the real JOIN messages.\n\t+ /^COMMAND hides the output of the command, it's not written to\n\t  log either. Good for sending passwords for example.\n\t+ If you're pasting text to channel and some of it starts with /,\n\t  Irssi will send the \"/command\" to channel if it doesn't exist\n\t  (instead of just printing \"unknown command\").\n\t+ --enable-perl[=libdir] to configure - you can specify what\n\t  directory to install the perl libraries.\n\t+ Implemented runtime loadable modules. /LOAD loads a module,\n\t  /UNLOAD unloads it.\n\t+ You can change statusbar colors with /SET statusbar_xxx.\n\t+ Added -clear option to /SET.\n\t+ Tab-completion for /FORMAT.\n\t+ Ctrl-Y undeletes the last line deleted with Ctrl-U.\n\t- Reconnecting to server had a few bugs\n\t- /RELOADing configuration produced a few bugs\n\t- Highlighting had several bugs\n\t- Automatic command and option completions had some bugs\n\t- -option tab-completion didn't work\n\nv0.7.92 2000-06-30  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Some changes:\n\t    /REHASH -> /RELOAD\n\t    /SERVER -add, -remove, -list -> /SERVER ADD, REMOVE, LIST\n\t    /SET window_close_on_part -> /SET autoclose_windows\n\t    /HILIGHT -nick -> /HILIGHT -mask (see below)\n\t+ Automatic completion of /commands. Automatic completion of\n\t  command -options. Complains about unknown -options.\n\t+ /MSG [-<server tag>] <nick> <msg> - you can specify what server\n\t  to send the message to.\n\t+ Rewrote tab-completion to be modular, it's REALLY easy to add\n\t  completion to whatever you want. It now handles:\n\t    - Command completion works better, subcommand completion works\n\t    - Command -option completion\n\t    - /MSG completion completes from all IRC servers, so if you had\n\t      message from ircnet and efnet, irssi will complete with\n\t      /MSG -ircnet nick1 -> /MSG -efnet nick2\n\t    - #channel completion works - it completes only channels you\n\t      have joined or have in setup\n\t    - File name completion with /DCC SEND (and other commands)\n\t    - /TOGGLE settings completion\n\t    - Completion for command parameters or subcommands work right\n\t      even if the command was typed as alias.\n\t+ /HILIGHT updates:\n\t     - -nick highlights only the nick, not the whole line. Works\n\t       only with public messages.\n\t     - -mask option matches the text for nick mask (it didn't even\n\t       work before).\n\t     - Window numbers in activity list are colored with hilight\n\t       color.\n\t     - You can give real color names with -color option. All the\n\t       \"normal\" colors can be given, if you want bold colors, use\n\t       b+color name, like bgreen.\n\t     - /SET hilight_color specifies the default highlight color\n\t     - /SET hilight_only_nick specifies if we should highlight the\n\t       nick or the whole line if -nick or -nonick wasn't specified\n\t       with /HILIGHT.\n\t+ /LAST -away checks only lines that came after last time you\n\t  went away.\n\t+ You can specify command(s) to be sent automatically to server\n\t  after connected with /IRCNET -autosendcmd. Useful for sending\n\t  your password to NickServ.\n\t+ Added /SET reuse_unused_windows setting, default is OFF. Works\n\t  only when /SET autoclose_windows is ON. This specifies if new\n\t  windows should be joined to new window, or if existing empty\n\t  windows should be used.\n\t+ /SET lag_min_show -1 disables displaying lag entirely.\n\t- /SCROLLBACK HOME, END and GOTO commands weren't working right.\n\t- Closing active window that had channels/queries could crash\n\t- Using \\n with /SET expand_escapes ON didn't work right.\n\t- Logging HILIGHT messages didn't work\n\t- The \"max. count\" parameter in /LAST didn't work right.\n\nv0.7.91 2000-06-14  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t+ Ctrl-X changes IRC server in stats/msgs/empty windows.\n\t+ /JOIN -<server tag> #channel joins to channel in specified server.\n\t+ /WHOIS automatically sends a /WHOWAS query if nick wasn't in IRC.\n\t+ if some unknown /command had another / in it, like /usr/bin,\n\t  send it as normal message. good for copypasting paths :)\n\t+ If you're not allowed to connect to server (K-lined, no I-line),\n\t  Irssi won't try to reconnect back to the server.\n\t+ You can disable window activity notifies in specified channels\n\t  with /SET noact_channels #chan1 #chan2 .. The activity is\n\t  displayed if window had a message to you.\n\t+ Tab-completion works now with /commands and /set variables\n\t+ /SET close_window_on_part - should we close the window too when\n\t  /PARTing channel\n\t+ /SET autocreate_own_query ON - creates query window when you\n\t  send message with /MSG nick.\n\t+ /SET mail_counter specifies if we should show mail counter in\n\t  statusbar.\n\t+ /SET wall_format specifies the text that's sent with /WALL\n\t+ If you /SET expand_escapes ON and type \\n or \\t to text line, they\n\t  will be expanded to newline and tab.\n\t+ Ctrl-W deletes word in left\n\t- Flood was detected wrong - /SET flood_timecheck's argument was\n\t  supposed to be seconds, not milliseconds.\n\t- Unignoring autoignored nicks didn't work\n\t- Logging wrote messages to log file twice\n\t- /WINDOW MOVE <number> could put irssi to infinite loop\n\t- ANSI blink code crashed irssi.\n\t- Replying to DCC GET and CHAT requests didn't work\n\t- /HILIGHT displayed levels twice, /HILIGHT -channels didn't work\n\t- /SET ignore_signals wasn't read at startup..\n\nv0.7.90 2000-06-04  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* On the way to 0.8.0 .. Major rewriting/rearranging code. There's\n\t  some changes in behaviour because I'm trying to make Irssi\n\t  compatible with EPIC as much as possible (except the scripting,\n\t  perl should be enough?)\n\n\t* DOCUMENTATION! See docs/manual.txt\n\n\t  This NEWS file contains only the biggest new features, you should\n\t  browse through the documentation to find the rest. Some of the\n\t  parameters of commands listed in this file aren't really up to\n\t  date since I got a bit bored writing them here too.. They are\n\t  correct in the manual.\n\n\t* Irssi isn't anymore IRC specific client, you could easily take the\n\t  whole IRC part away and use some other chat protocol instead, or\n\t  use both at the same time. Currently however, only IRC protocol\n\t  is supported. See docs/design.txt for more information.\n\n\t* libPropList isn't needed anymore - I'm using my own configuration\n\t  library. This is mostly because different proplists worked a bit\n\t  differently everywhere and several people had problems with it.\n\t  It's also yet another extra library that you needed to compile\n\t  Irssi. New configuration library has several advantages:\n\n\t  You can add comments to configuration file and they also stay\n\t  there when it's saved.\n\n\t  It's not nearly as vulnerable as proplist. If some error occurs,\n\t  instead of just not reading anything it will try to continue if\n\t  possible. Also the error messages are written to irssi's text\n\t  window instead of stdout.\n\n\t  It can be managed more easily than proplist - setting/getting the\n\t  configuration is a lot more easier.\n\n\t* Coding style changes - I'm not using gint, gchar etc. anymore,\n\t  they're just extra pain when moving code to non-glib projects and\n\t  syntax hilighting doesn't work by default with most editors ;)\n\n\t  Indentation style was also changed to K&R because of some political\n\t  reasons ;) And I'm already starting to like it.. :) It forces me\n\t  to split code to different functions more often and the result is\n\t  that the code gets more readable.\n\n\t  And finally I'm also using `const' all over the place.\n\n\t* Signal handlers changed - you don't anymore return value 0 if you\n\t  wish to stop signal. Instead use signal_stop() or\n\t  signal_stop_by_name().\n\n\t+ Flood protection when sending commands to server works now better.\n\t  It allows sending first 5 messages immediately, but after that\n\t  only one message is sent every 2.2 seconds.\n\n\t  This is the same flood protection that most IRC servers use, so\n\t  the only affect this protection has is that when sending a lot of\n\t  commands to server you won't get kicked out from server because of\n\t  \"excessive flood\".\n\n\t  This can be changed from settings `cmd_max_at_once' and\n\t  `cmd_queue_speed'. If you want to disable this for some reason, use\n\t  /SET cmd_queue_speed 0\n\t+ Split windows in text version, all the normal ircII /WINDOW\n\t  commands should work: new, kill, grow, shrink, balance, show, hide\n\t+ /EVAL <commands> - Expand all the special variables from string and\n\t  run it.

This\n\t             makes only sense if you specify date/time formats\n\t\t     to file name.\n\t    <filename>: File name where to log, it is parsed with strftime(),\n\t                so %d=day, etc. see \"man strftime\" for more info.\n\t    <levels>: Defaults to ALL\n          /LOG CLOSE <ref#> | <fname> - close log and remove from log list\n\t  /LOG START <ref#> | <fname> - start logging to file\n\t  /LOG STOP <ref#> | <fname> - stop logging to file\n\t  /LOG - display the log list\n\t  NOTE: Log files are locked after opened, so two irssi's can't\n\t  accidentally try to write to same log file.\n\t+ /WINDOW LOG ON|OFF|TOGGLE [<filename>]\n\t  Start/stop logging window, same as /LOG OPEN -window.

If you\n\t  are using multiple servers, it makes sense to use the server tag\n\t  as part of the file name, for example ~/irclogs/$tag/$0.log (this\n\t  is the default).\n\t+ /SET window_auto_change - if enabled, irssi will automatically\n\t  change to automatically created windows (like queries). It will\n\t  also clear your command line and put it to command history so that\n\t  you don't accidentally write anything to wrong window. You'll get\n\t  the command back by pressing up arrow.\n\t+ /SET show_quit_once - show quit message only once instead of in\n\t  all channel windows the nick was joined.\n\t+ Server reconnections work better. It will now automatically set\n\t  your previous user mode and away message (and rejoin the channels,\n\t  which it already did before) after reconnected. If you use /SERVER\n\t  to connect to different IRC network, none of this will be done.\n\t+ /CAT <filename> - prints the file to screen\n\t+ /SET query_auto_close <secs> - automatically close queries after\n\t  <secs> seconds.

It takes less memory and\n\t  if you resize the terminal horizonally, the text automatically\n\t  changes to right size. Several other changes too:\n\n\t  /CLEAR only clears the screen, you can still scroll the window up.\n\t  /SCROLLBACK, or the default alias /SB:\n            /SB CLEAR - Clear screen, free all memory used by texts in window.\n            /SB HOME - Jump to start of the buffer\n            /SB END - Jump to end of the buffer\n            /SB GOTO [[-|+]line#|time] - Jump to specified line or timestamp.\n\n\t    -100 jumps back 100 lines, +100 jumps forward 100 lines, or\n\t    100 simply jumps to 100. line in scrollback.\n\n\t    Time is the format [dd.mm | -<days ago>] hh:mi[:ss]\n\n\t    Examples:\n\t      /SB GOTO 15:00 - Jump to first text that came after 15:00 today\n\t      /SB GOTO -1 15:00 - First text after 15:00 yesterday\n\t      /SB GOTO 1.2 - First text in 1. February\n\t      /SB GOTO -100 - Jump back 100 lines\n\t      /SB GOTO +100 - Jump for\n\n\t+ After lost connection to server and reconnected or changed the\n\t  server manually with /SERVER, Irssi will rejoin back to the same\n\t  channels that you were in before disconnection. They will also be\n\t  placed to same windows they were, even if you were in same channel\n\t  in multiple servers.\n\t+ /SERVERS and disconnect dialog displays also servers that are\n\t  being currently connected and waiting reconnections. You can remove\n\t  them with /DISCONNECT <tag>.\n\t+ If you are in multiple irc servers and the active server of the\n\t  window isn't the same as where the message came from, the message\n\t  is prefixed with a [server tag].\n\t+ If you don't specify the path for Perl scripts, Irssi tries to\n\t  find them from ~/.irssi/scripts/ or /usr/lib/irssi/scripts/\n\t  directories. Irssi will also run automatically scripts in\n\t  ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/ at startup. Several other updates to\n\t  Perl support too.\n\t+ Support for ircII translation tables, /set translation <file>\n\t  See /usr/share/ircII/translation/* (at least in Debian)\n\t+ /ACTION <target> <text> - Send action to target (like /ME), target\n\t  is either #channel, nick or =dcc_char_nick\n\t+ 5 CTRL-C's in a row quits irssi-text.\n\t+ %| in themes marks the line indentation position - works only in\n\t  irssi-text for now..\n\t+ You can have several msgs/status windows, one for each server.\n\t+ Option: start GNOME panel applet at startup\n\t+ --without-gtk option for configure disables building GTK frontend\n\t+ /LAST -new shows only the texts that came after latest /LAST.\n\t- Autojoining doesn't switch automatically to the joined channel's\n\t  window (try #2 :)\n\t- Several (Perl) compilation problems fixed.\n\t- Text hilight color was dark grey, changed to white..\n\t- /LAST doesn't display the texts found from previous /LAST blocks\n\t- Fixed a few memory leaks\n\nv0.7.27 2000-02-25  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t* Perl support - finally! Took only a year or so to imlement it ;)\n\t  Well, I could have done it ages ago but it wouldn't have had\n\t  all the flexibility it now has - you should be able to do almost\n\t  anything with perl scripts. See DOCS/PERL for some documentation\n\t  and examples/ directory for a couple of example scripts.\n\n\t  This is the very first version and I haven't even tested that all\n\t  functions work correctly! Any suggestions are welcome. I don't\n\t  really like the values() functions so if someone knows better ways\n\t  to do them I'd really like to hear.\n\n\t  BTW. I haven't had time to learn Perl well yet, so my scripts are\n\t  probably not the best examples.. :)\n\n\t  If for some reason you don't wish to use Perl, you can disble it\n\t  with giving --disable-perl to configure.\n\n\t+ /CYCLE [#channel] - parts/rejoins the channel\n\t+ Autojoining doesn't switch automatically to the joined channel's\n\t  window.\n\t+ Server tag generation is a bit smarter now.\n\t+ irssi-text: Resizing terminal works now right even if your curses\n\t  don't have resizeterm() function.\n\t- /NAMES crashed when done in a non-channel window\n\t- irssi-text: Resizing terminal when irssi had some empty windows\n\t  messed them up..\n\t- toggle_show_nickmode didn't actually do anything :) It was\n\t  always on..\n\nv0.7.26 2000-02-19  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t- Space (and maybe other keys) didn't work when caps/numlock was on.\n\nv0.7.25 2000-02-19  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>\n\n\t+ /WQUERY - create query to current window\n\t+ Irssi doesn't close the window anymore when using /PART\n\t+ irssi-text also displays user's address in topic bar in queries.\n\t+ /NAMES list is now displayed sorted\n\t+ irssi-text: /WINDOW MOVE PREV|NEXT\n\t- Topic bar sometimes displayed some other channel's topic if the\n\t  channel didn't have a topic.\n\t- Irssi automatically changed to auto-created query windows..\n\t- When using /WINDOW CLOSE it didn't change to different window\n\t- Made fontset_load() optional - it broke some fonts..\n\t- Using Ctrl-B (bold) didn't move the cursor\n\nv0.7.24 2000-02-19  Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi> [stable]\n\n\t+ French translation\n\t+ Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation translation, now with\n\t  the right pot file name :)\n\t+ Using fontset_load() instead of font_load(), helps with using\n\t  some fonts (by hashao@telebot.com)\n\t+ /TS - display topics of all channels you're joined\n\t+ Automatically change to the created window\n\t+ Option: Show op/voice status in channel messages before nick.\n\t+ irssi-text: Displays topic bar op the top of the screen -\n\t  /set toggle_show_topicbar = yes|no\n\t+ Recognize +a (anonymous) and +r (reop when opless) modes\n\t+ Don't allow any setup file changes or log writing if another irssi\n\t  session is running.\n\t+ /whois without any arguments gives a whois of yourself\n\t- Irc network list was still corrupted in channel dialog.\n\t- /LIST dialog - users column is now sorted numerically\n\t  (10 shows after 9, not after 1)..\n\t- Log setup dialog: Clear all button was over Client errors\n\t  toggle button.\n\t- /LAST's output displayed some crap in log file.\n\t- irssi-text should work better with other curses libraries than\n\t  ncurses\n\t- irssi-text should work better with non-black backgounds\n\t- Fixed tab completion when completion char was comma\n\t- Couple of configure bugs fixed\n\t- Specifying source host (vhosts) didn't work.\n\t- DCC resume had been broken quite a while\n\nv0.7.23 2000-01-23  Timo Sirainen <cras@irccrew.org> [stable]\n\n\t+ channel's key (+k key) is displayed in irssi-text's statusbar if it\n\t  has one.\n\t+ Nick hilight detector is a bit smarter now, for example if your\n\t  nick happens to be \"its\", \"it's blahblah\" doesn't trigger it..\n\t+ colorless irssi-text (/set colors = no): activity list is split in\n\t  two, Act and Det lists.

Check README how to use it.\n\n\t+ Irssi is now much faster catching up things after joined to\n\t  channel, it asks channels' MODE and WHO first, all with the same\n\t  command (WHO #a,#b,#c), after them it asks the ban lists etc. less\n\t  important things.\n\t+ Workaround for GTK themes eating X server's memory\n\t+ Command line arguments:\n\t\t-c server [-p port] : connects to server at startup\n\t\t-! : don't autoconnect to any servers\n\t\t-n : specify nick to use (override setup)\n\t+ Server lag displayed in statusbar, you can also set irssi to\n\t  automatically disconnect from server if it is too lagged\n\t+ Channel limit and key is displayed above nicklist\n\t+ Number of ops and total number of nicks in channel is displayed\n\t+ Nicklist background color can be changed\n\t+ Each window can have it's own command history buffer\n\t+ Try to let the server disconnect the socket (5 sec timeout) to make\n\t  sure that quit message gets through.\n\t+ Improved /gwhois dialog\n\t+ Setup dialogs are resizeable\n\t+ You can specify what port to use with DCC.\n\t- Channel dialog fixes: after editing channel, it was moved to the\n\t  end of the list, opening multiple channels edit dialogs didn't\n\t  work right\n        - Reconnecting to server didn't work (always)\n\t- Giving multiple nicks for /gwhois messed up irssi\n\nv0.7.16 1999-09-13  Timo Sirainen <cras@irccrew.org> [unstable]\n\n\t+ Started bot plugin, it has simple user management functions and\n\t  auto-opping/voicing done (but it does it well :)\n\t+ \"channel synced\" text doesn't trigger channel activity anymore\n\t+ Rawlog displays where event was redirected\n\t+ /wjoin - you can join multiple channels in same window\n\t+ /window goto #channel - moves you to window with the\n\t  channel, query or dcc chat\n\t+ /window goto active - moves you to first window with activity\n\t+ /list and /names complains if they're run without any arguments,\n\t  -YES overrides this\n\t+ Giving -nogui parameter to /list and /who commands doesn't use the\n\t  GUI dialog\n\t+ All the dialogs that have clist widget: you can resize columns and\n\t  sort the list by clicking the headers\n\t+ /list and /who dialogs displays total number of items and the list\n\t  is searchable\n\t+ Autojoining to channels work with irssi-text too\n\t+ /gwhois dialog has now refresh button, /gwhois is used when clicking\n          whois from nicklist popup menu\n\t- Restoring saved window size didn't work very accurately, restoring\n\t  position also had some problems..\n\t- Rawlog doesn't crash anymore if not connected to server\n\t- Notifylist and checking of who uses your nick uses WHOIS again,\n\t  WHO didn't display user info unless s/he was -i or in same\n\t  channels..\n\t- You had to run /list a couple of times until it worked..\n\t- WHO was sent to people who joined channel to find out who they\n\t  were, unfortunately it had a small bug and didn't work..\n\t- DCC didn't work with IPv6\n\nv0.7.15-3 1999-08-31  Timo Sirainen <cras@irccrew.org> [unstable]\n\n\t* _TOO_ many bugs in .15, mostly compilation problems, I really\n\t  should test things better when I release them.

Changed CTCPs to use\n\t  this.\n\t+ \"massjoin\" signal is sent when people join to channel, if many\n\t  people join to channel quickly (netjoins), it waits for a while\n\t  before everyone are joined and then sends the signal.

(somehow I think I'll end up with 0.7.14-2\n\t  anyway.. ;)\n\n\t* Irssi uses now libPropList to read and save configuration file, so\n\t  you need to have libPropList installed, it's also in different\n\t  format so your old config file doesn't work anymore.\n\n\t  Configuration file is located now in ~/.irssi/config file.\n\t  Themes are also now stored in separate files in ~/.irssi/*.theme\n\n\t+ Irssi can now notify you about new versions, you can also directly\n\t  download them with DCC.

Cape <jcape@jcinteractive.com>\n\t+ You can use ctrl-b,c,g,v,- when setting realname\n\t+ /version [server] - prints irssi version and irc server's version\n\t+ /ver [nick/channel] - sends ctcp version to nick/channel\n\t+ /sv [nick/channel] - sends irssi version text to nick/channel\n\t+ Added widget depends to several places, changed several modal\n\t  dialogs to use gui_widget_depends() instead\n\t+ Added Socks5 initialization, maybe it works now?\n\t+ You can specify what host address you want to use if you have many..\n\t+ Away and kick reason dialog have history\n\t+ irssi-text option: activity list can be sorted by window number\n\t  You can change this with /set toggle_actlist_moves=yes/no\n\t+ /msg <text><tab> completes now people in current channel too\n\t+ You can set channel password in channel dialog\n\t+ /SET [key [=value / [key [key..]] - /SET displays all settings,\n\t  /set key key2 displays values of key and key2, /set key=value sets\n\t  key to value.\n\t+ DCC GET now gets all the files coming from user if file name isn't\n\t  specified. DCC CLOSE also can close all dcc connections from user.\n\t+ The whole usermode is now displayed in statusbar, it used to display\n\t  only the modes it knew (+iwsr)\n\t+ Ctrl-N and Ctrl-P go to next/previous window\n\t- When using zvt and joining to new channels, window size grew bigger\n\t- /msg <tab> completion was a bit buggy, if someone sent you multiple\n\t  messages, you had to press tab multiple times until the nick changed\n\t  to someone else..\n\t- Default format for signon time in whois displayed nick instead of\n\t  the signon time..\n\t- Disconnecting server while it was still trying to connect hung irssi\n\t- If old configuration file wasn't found, irssi (could have?) crashed\n\t  on startup .. Could this really happen?!? Why did nobody tell me??\n\t- irssi-text finally handles screen resizing right\n\t- Gnome panel applet works with \"old\" (like non-cvs now :) panels\n\t  too.\n\t- If you left from channel before syncing was done, syncing stopped\n\t  working after it..\n\t- Removing ban exceptions didn't update irssi's internal list\n\t- Rejecting dcc chat didn't work properly, when receiving reject\n\t  get/send irssi didn't remove it from dcc lists\n\t- Save/find dialogs weren't working after being closed.\n\t- irssi-text complained about \"Not enough parameters given\" when\n\t  pressing entry in empty line\n\t- Mirc colors weren't removed properly for logs and could have\n\t  crashed irssi\n\t- Using /ban with mask (x!x@x) instead of nick crashed\n\t- gui_widget_depends() wasn't working properly - didn't harm much :)\n\nv0.7.13-2 1999-07-22  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t* Again, a small bugfix release\n\n\t+ You can specify what string to send to IRC proxy after connected,\n\t  this lets at least some proxies work with irssi.\n\t+ Notifylist now displays which irc network nick joined/left (or if\n\t  unknown, just IRC)\n\t- After closing some window, the numbers in window tabs didn't get\n\t  updated\n\t- /window next and prev didn't work properly\n\t- status/msgs windows got destroyed a while after joining to channel..\n\t  or simply by doing \"/mode (status)\" command ..\n\t- We don't try to DCC SEND file via dcc chat if the other side is\n\t  using mirc ctcps.\n\t- Default setting or autodetection of mirc ctcps weren't working.\n\t- Actions from mirc users in dcc chat was displayed in double.\n\nv0.7.13 1999-07-21  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t* %p in text formats is changed to $, looks much cleaner :) Old\n          formats in configuration files are automatically converted.\n\n\t* I got some documentation done! :) I wrote a list of all commands\n\t  irssi knows with (very) short descriptions, see COMMANDS file\n\n\t+ Hebrew support by Ronen Tzur <rtzur@shani.net> - see README-HEBREW\n        + Users with gone-flag are displayed with different color in nicklist\n          List is updated with USERHOST commands in small pieces every now and\n          then..\n        + Statusbar with some information in it ..\n        + Away message is displayed differently in /whois and /msged people\n          who's gone\n        + /window goto <n>, /window prev, /window next\n        + /window level [+/-]pub/msgs/...\n            /window level msgs      - creates messages window\n            /window level all -msgs - creates status window\n\t+ /bantype <normal/host/domain/custom>\n\t    - Normal - *!user@*.domain.net\n\t    - Host   - *!*@host.domain.net\n\t    - Domain - *!*@*.domain.net\n\t    - Custom [nick] [user] [host] [domain]\n\t\teg. /bantype custom nick domain - nick!*@*.domain.net\n\t\teg. /bantype custom user host - *!user@host.domain.net\n\t+ /version - just displays version number..\n        + You can use different font in each channel\n\t+ Alt-q..o changes channels to 11..19\n        + Color configuration changes..\n        + irssi-text : Reading manuals help ;) Text's backgound color isn't\n\t  changed to black anymore so pixmaps etc. should show up nicely :)\n        + /notify nick!mask@* [ircnets], /unnotify\n        + When trying to connect to server, you can abort it with the\n\t  cancel button in statusbar\n\t+ First parameter of /disconnect is now * (current server) or\n          server tag\n\t+ You can now use !channels with their short names (not always)\n        + Right clicking nick in channel pops up nicklist menu\n        + You can select multiple nicks from nicklist and execute the command\n          for all of them.\n        + Panel applet supports panel size changes\n\t+ Window tabs have numbers now\n\t+ Ctrl-N changes to next window, Ctrl-P changes to previous window\n\t- Max. autoget size didn't work right, it got the file if the file was\n\t  bigger than the max. size.. and it was compared as bytes, not kB's.\n\t- Panel applet should now work right\n        - Hilight words feature was completely broken\n        - DCC Chats were displayed twice in status dialog\n        - Closing DCC chat still had a few problems\n        - After trying to join to channel where you could get in (invite only,\n          banned, etc.) the created channel window wasn't destroyed.\n        - configure didn't check -lnsl right..\n\t- Channel settings weren't read in the correct order -> autojoining\n          to channels created the windows in reverse order every time.\n        - ZVT in GNOME CVS broke irssi..

Weird, after changing the code with\n          creating channels to empty windows, GtkText widget started working\n          again, it used to crash after running the test ircserver for a\n          while.. Maybe a few more versions and I'll release a \"stable\"\n          labeled version again (08.0).\n\n\t+ GNOME version can use ZVT widget to draw texts. This is a lot faster\n          than GtkText and with it you can use nice non-scrolling backgrounds\n          and transparency! However, you'll have to use the default colors\n          with it for now and Window/Save Buffer or Find doesn't work in it.\n          !!NOTE!! ZVT in gnome 1.0.9 is buggy, it sometimes crashes when\n          destroying zvt widget (leaving channels). It should be fixed in next\n          version (which doesn't currently exist..)\n\t+ DCC transfer dialog, display list of all going dcc transfers, the\n\t  old dialogs can also be created.\n        + Channel specific background pixmaps, if you don't have Imlib you can\n          use only .xpm images.\n\t+ /ban and /unban changed, they accept multiple arguments and channel\n          name may be specified as the first argument\n        + dcc actions from mirc should work now\n        - Text widget size is now saved instead of the window's size, should\n          work better.\n        - Right clicking text widget created a popup menu, but select\n          selection got broken after it\n        - Some potential bugs fixed after got kicked from channel\n        - Log dialog was buggy\n        - If dcc chat was closed but the query window was still there, trying\n          to chat again with the same nick created another query window but\n          used the old one..\n        - C-C, C-B, etc. add the character at the end of the entry, not at the\n          current position\n        - Redirecting commands was a bit buggy, it always expected to receive\n          the specified events. This worked with ISON command, but I forgot\n          that WHOIS could also return \"no such nick\" events.. So, notifylist\n          should now work right instead of sometimes printing whois results.\n        - You couldn't use the normal control-? keys (c-left, c-right,\n          c-insert, ..)\n        - mirc colors were displayed with wrong colors\n\t- Changed all isspace(), isdigit() and isalnum() calls to cast their\n          argument as (gint) to remove warnings when compiling with IRIX.\n\t- Speech plugin wasn't working again..\n        - After changing text format from setup, you couldn't change any\n          other lines without closing setup dialog first\n        - Font couldn't be changed by editing the entry line\n\t- /knockout format changed, it's now /knockout [timeout] nick reason\n          (so the reason can have number at the start of it..), it also used\n          to crash when unbanning\n\t- DCC send fixed, fast send didn't work and without it it was eating\n          all cpu.\n        - DCC sending files with spaces in their name didn't work (they're\n          changed to _ now.)\n\nv0.7.9 1999-04-22  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t+ Server/status dialog, displays list of all connected servers,\n          channels, queries and dcc chats.\n        + Host resolving is now done in a child processes. Hopefully works\n          better than threads which aren't used anywhere anymore..\n        + Window/Save window size and Save window position, next time the same\n          window (status, msgs, channel, query) is opened the saved size\n          and/or position will be used.\n        + gui_widget_depends_data(), widget will be automatically destroyed\n          if the specified signal is called with the specified argument. Used\n          to destroy DCC request dialogs when they're closed manually, timed\n          out or rejected at the other end..\n        - Fixed lots of memory leaks which some might have caused crashes..\n          src/memdebug.c has the debug functions I used ..\n        - DCC CLOSE closed always the last dcc connection instead of the one\n          that matched the parameters\n        - Commented out all GUI_INPUT_EXCEPTIONs .. I don't even know when\n          exceptions are sent and why (I thought that only when some error\n          occurred..), Linux doesn't seem to send them ever? IRIX however sends\n          them all the time which made irssi eating all cpu.\n        - Fixed compiling gui-text with systems that had only slang/slang.h\n        - gui_widget_depends() had some bugs\n        - adding irc networks by typing it's name when adding server didn't\n          update the GUI of ircnets list.\n\t- If some plugins were already loaded, and loading new plugin failed\n          and it called plugin_deinit(), the call (might have) called some\n          other plugin's plugin_deinit() and crash.. Some updated to change\n          all global plugin functions to plugin_name_* calls so they wouldn't\n          call other modules functions..\n\t- If day changed when logging, the log file contained the day change\n          lines before each line after that..\n\t- Channel labels were hilighted even when the channel was selected..\n\nv0.7.8 1999-04-12  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t* This version has lots of internal changes, I haven't tried them\n          much so hopefully everything works right..\n\n\t+ external plugin, reads commands from named pipe and executes them\n        + sample plugin updated, creating new plugins should when based on\n          this one\n        + gui-none is built, it tries to run bot plugin which doesn't exist..\n\t+ Moved the configuration code to the lowest level, made settings\n          to be common with all guis.\n        + /set command: /set [category[/key[=value]]] [all]\n        + /alias, /ignore and /unignore commands work again\n        + Nick completion finally working, and better than ever (unless it\n          has bugs of course ;). It tries to be smart when completing, first\n          it checks if someone with same letters had recently written message\n          to you, then it checks for nicks that recently wrote messages and\n          finally for the rest of the nicks in channel. Clicking tab more\n          scans the list. Clicking tab in empty line completes to /msg <nick\n          who sent you last message>. Before trying to complete nicks, tab\n          completion checks if the word is in setup's completion list.\n        + Wrote some functions to make possible handling events in different\n          places depending where the command which created the event was sent.\n          This is useful for example to notify list which needs to send ISON\n          requests but user should still be able to use /ison command\n          normally (this has always worked btw).\n        + Notify list's notify event now displays user's host and real name\n          (made with the previous functions which grabbed WHOIS). Notify list\n          GUI also updated for this\n        + You can use user/host masks with notify lists, wildcards are\n          allowed. Nick must always be specified (could be fixed but everyone\n          is invisible anyway so it would be useless). Examples:\n          friend!*friend*@*, friend_!*friend*@*,\n          another!*@*.blah.com, altnick!*@*.blah.com\n\t+ \"your nick is owned by blah (blah@blah.org)\" when connected\n        + Text formats page uses now GtkText widget, it displays colors too.\n          It's not perfect but better than before...\n        + There's now three different colors indicating what's happened in\n          channel: red = some text was written there, bright red = public\n          message, magenta = public message to you\n        + Ignore checking is now done by stopping the entire signal so\n          plugins etc. don't have to deal with them.\n        + You can use user/host masks with ignores\n        + Autoraise (in window menu) window when new message comes to channel\n        + Channel settings: You can specify list of bots (masks) and command\n\t  to send the first one found bot (nice for auto-opping ourself)\n        - Changing user modes from menus didn't work. Moved the menu under\n          server menu.\n\t- Speech plugin problems fixed.. It didn't compile without gnome\n          libraries and with gnome libraries it didn't say anything because\n          for some reason one line in sources was commented out..\n        - IRC network things and server password didn't work because of stupid\n          little bug\n        - Configuration file handling was a bit broken in GTK version\n\t- Rewrote menu handling in GTK version, it was crashing when trying\n          to load plugins..\n\nv0.7.7 1999-04-05  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t+ speech plugin :) This is currently made to work with festival\n          (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/), it's not very usable\n          but nice to play with :)\n        + C-b (bold), C-c (color), C-g (bell), C-v (reverse), C-- (underline)\n          keys work now but they don't display anything in entry line.\n        + Beel character beeps are now optional\n        + Fixes and new features for plugins. Each plugin has now it's own\n          menu under plugin menu and \"Unload\" menuitem there by default.\n        - GTK version didn't build .. again..\n        - I broke DCC send in 0.7.5\n        - SIGPIPE is ignored, maybe fixes some \"crashes\" when server\n          connection is lost (I never got this btw.)\n        - Using irssi with click to focus sent commands to window where mouse\n          cursor was..\n        - Fixed some bugs when scrollback buffer got full (GTK's text widget\n          seems to crash sometimes with small scrollback buffer and _lots_ of\n          text!)\n        - Plugin dialog didn't show any plugins\n\t- Plugins are now created with automake things to make them portable\n          for compilers/linkers that don't work with -shared switch. The\n          disadvantage is that a lot of unnecessary files are created for\n          each plugin (.a, .la, .so.0, .so.0.0, .so.0.0.0) while irssi uses\n          only libplugin.so, could be fixed somehow but too difficult for me..\n\t- Joining to +k channel crashed\n\nv0.7.6 1999-03-29  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t* New default colors .. I think they're better, not the best possible\n          but anyway, I'm not good with these :)\n        + Text mode version working again with colors! :)\n\t+ New settings/servers dialog, changed connect and channels dialogs.\n          You can now automatically connect to multiple servers at startup.\n          All this made by Kari Lavikka (tuner@bdb.fi)\n        + Server password support\n        + IRC proxy support\n        + Right clicking the channel name in panel pops up channel menu\n        + private ctcp and notice messages now show up in query windows if\n          it exists for sender\n        - Fixed logging a bit, you can now log stuff from nicks without\n          having query window for them.\n        - If time stamps were enabled, log files had time stamps twice in each\n          line\n        - Color settings had some bugs\n\t- GNOME version crashed if ~/.irssi.conf didn't exist .. because I\n          read the configuration file before gnome_init() which was necessary\n          for \"create gnome panel applet\" option in setup -> removed it\n\nv0.7.5 1999-03-17  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t* Text mode version is broken and isn't built.\n        * Configuration file has changed quite a lot, might be better if you\n          would just erase the old one.. Server configuration is also going\n          to change soon..\n\n        + Plugins are back! But unfortunately I can't get perl plugin to work.\n          See TODO for more information.\n        + I divided setup dialogs to separate windows and grouped the options\n          to different frames so they actually make some sense now :) Also\n          some new options:\n        \t- Create GNOME panel applet\n                - Lots of DCC options, the page looked so lonely that I had\n                  to put more options there :)\n                    - get: autorename file if it exists (currently this is\n                      done always..)\n                    - autoget: max. file size to get\n                    - fast send (don't wait for responses from the other\n                      side, just keep sending the data..)\n                    - upload path\n                    - block size\n                    - timeout\n\t+ Checks for slang/slang.h too ..\n        + Text mode version doesn't have my name/nick hardcoded in it\n          anymore :) Uses IRCNAME and IRCNICK environment variables.\n        + Status window is now optional, when enabled it grabs all\n          \"status\" messages there. This needed quite a lot of inner changes,\n          hopefully works :)\n        + /nctcp - send ctcp reply\n        + Window size is now saved when quitting and it's used when creating\n          windows in next session\n        - Fixed lots of GLib-CRITICAL messages when disconnected from server\n          while it was still trying to find ip address.\n        - Window/find should now scroll to right position and it doesn't\n          corrupt the text widget with inserting new texts to found texts\n          positions.. It's also case-insensitive now.\n\t- Fixed compile error when building without gnome panel..\n\nv0.7.4 1999-03-13  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t+ Applet for GNOME panel working again\n\t+ You don't have to specify --without-gnome anymore, configure checks\n          this for you (finally)\n        + Some widget packing changes and tooltips for channel mode buttons\n          by Kari Lavikka <tuner@bdb.fi>\n        + Window/find moves the scrollbar to position where you can\n          actually see the found text (usually, find prev misses it\n          sometimes..)\n        - Disconnect button in disconnect dialog still wasn't working.\n        - Channel mode buttons didn't change if channel wasn't focused\n        - I added separators to menus in v0.7.3, but forgot to make GTK\n          version work with them\n\t- Closing DCC chat crashed\n\t- Destroying window with WM now really destroys the window, no hide\n          it like it used to..\n        - Several fixes with window handling..\n\nv0.7.3 1999-03-11  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t* Text mode version is not called irssi-text so make install can\n          install both of them without overwriting the other..\n        + Window menu: find text, save window buffer, close window, new,\n          new tabbed .. And lots of fixing code to make empty windows\n          possible.\n        + After kicked from channel, the window isn't destroyed\n        - While connecting to server and receiving \"nick is temporarily\n          unavailable\" irssi didn't try different nick but got just stuck\n          there.\n\nv0.7.2 1999-03-10  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t+ GUI for logging, /log start, /log stop\n\t+ You can drag file from GMC over to nick in nicklist to send the file\n          with DCC\n        + Nicklist changed to GtkCList, ops and voices are marked with\n          pixmaps (stolen from X-Chat, someone want to do better ones?). Had\n          to be done because adding drag'n'drop to GtkList was too slow..\n\t- Pretty bad bugs with GTK version fixed, using several dialogs'\n          buttons crashed..\n        - WHOIS's idle line displayed seconds wrong. Maybe I finally got it\n          fixed right this time.. :)\n\t- Unknown commands still didn't work.

So, this version\n          requires GTK 1.1/1.2.\n\n        + Started gui-text.. Should work somehow :) Prefers SLang but should\n          work with curses also, except in X terminals I couldn't get colors\n          out of it.\n        + Logging, still lacks GUI.\n\n          Syntax:\n            /log create <filename> [<+/->level ...] [#channel/nick [\n                                   [<+/->level ...] ...]\n            /log close <filename>\n            /log list\n\n          Example: /log create mylog -all +msgs #linux +chan +public +notices\n          (or simply #linux +all logs everything that appears in #linux\n          window).\n\n          You can use these levels, ALL is set by default:\n          ALL, CRAP, PUBLIC, MSGS, NOTICES, WALLOPS, SNOTES, ACTIONS, DCC,\n          CTCP, CLIENTNOTICES, CLIENTERRORS\n\t+ Automatically create query window when received msg (option)\n\t+ No more \"WHO: unknown commmand\"s, all unknown commands are sent to\n          server just like they were written\n\t+ Working again: msgs window, aliases, /kickban, /knockout\n        + Changed quite a lot of GString's to g_strdup_printf\n        + cleaned configure.in\n        - Disconnect button in disconnect dialog didn't work.\n        - Writing to DCC chat only sent the first word..\n        - setting ircnet to server record was done without strdup()ing from\n          setup server record, so after disconnecting preferences or\n          reconnecting could have crashed.\n\nv0.7.0 1999-02-25  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t* Lots and lots and LOTS of rewriting code. Hope you like it :) At\n          least I do, mostly. GUI still needs rewriting but.. well, it works\n          anyway now.\n\n          The [unstable] tag in this version really means that IT IS UNSTABLE.\n          See TODO for what features that 0.6.0 have are still missing.\n\n          Because of the new great signaling system :) lots of things can be\n          done easier. Now all the dialogs should be up to date, like channel\n          mode dialog. When you receive ops, widgets come sensitive, when you\n          lose your ops, the widgets become unsensitive.\n\n          irssi source is now also divided in to separate directories:\n\n          irc-base: this shouldn't change much, it has all basic functionality\n                    needed to create a working IRC client.\n\n          irc-extra: all kinds of extra functionality: dcc, flood detection,\n                     ignore lists, (logging soon), notify lists and plugins.\n\n          common-ui: here's all the functions that need to print some texts to\n                     screen.\n\n          gui-gnome: GTK/GNOME specific code\n\n          These haven't been started yet:\n          ui-none: make irssi work as a bot with plugins/scripts\n          ui-text: text mode interface\n          gui-kde, ...: I'm not going to do these, anyone?\n\nv0.6.0 1999-02-12  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t+ Plugins!

You can now have multiple real windows\n          with tabbed subwindows in them. It's also possible to have multiple\n          channels in one subwindow. Commands for handling these.. :\n           - /join - Works like before, creates real or subwindow depending\n             if \"use tabbed windows\" is set in setup.\n           - /wjoin - Joins channel to current window\n           - /hjoin - Creates new subwindow and joins there\n           - /njoin - Creates new real window and join there\n        + Changed URL max length from 20 to 200.. Didn't realize it was that\n          low :)\n        + Shows the nick who sent wallop, you need to change the second\n          line in format texts from \"%s\" to \"%s: %s\" to make this it work.\n          Need to do some kind of autoupgrading for formats that change..\n\t+ Found new functions from glib :)\n            - g_getenv(\"HOME\") -> g_get_home_dir()\n            - getpw() -> g_get_user_name() and g_get_real_name()\n            - strcasecmp() -> g_strcasecmp()\n            - strncasecmp() -> g_strncasecmp()\n        + GNOME version uses ~/.irssi.conf if it exists\n        - Opping/deopping anyone made irssi think that you were opped/deopped\n        - read_line() had some pretty bad bugs...\n\nv0.3.6 1999-01-29  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi> [unstable]\n\n\t+ irssi.spec to easily build .rpm\n\t+ Preferences:\n           - Alternative nick which is used when default nick is in use.\n           - Create own window for msgs\n           - Tab orientation\n           - Flood settings\n           - Max lines to keep in command line history\n           - Scrollback buffer size\n           - Text formats\n        + Toolbar .. we need pixmaps ..

They have the latest and greatest\n          features while they might not build/work too well. Check\n          http://www.sicom.fi/~ikioma/irssi-download.html, new versions will\n          probably be released quite often.\n\t* GNOME version now builds without GNOME panel applet library\n        * Works with GTK+ 1.0.6 now, maybe with older too.\n        + Connect / disconnect dialogs, channel dialog also started\n        + Server setup dialog changed some.\n        + Status window has a list of channels, queries and (yet not\n          implemented) DCC chats.

Without connect dialog this is\n          quite useless though :) But if you set \"connect to IRC server at\n          startup\" on, irssi connects you to first local server.\n\t+ aliases :\n\t   - /ALIAS <alias> <command to execute>\n           - alias page added to preferences\n           - these codes are extracted in commands:\n               %0            : alias name\n               %1, %2, %3 .. : word %\n               &1, &2, &3 .. : word & + the rest of the text after it\n               %c            : channel name\n           - typing extra / before /command (//command) ignores any aliases\n        + ignore list :\n           - /IGNORE <mask> <ignore level>\n           - /UNIGNORE <mask> <ignore level>\n           - ignore page added to preferences\n           - ignore levels: ALL, CRAP, CHAN, PUBLIC, MSGS, NOTICES, WALLOPS,\n             SNOTES, ACTIONS, DCC, CTCP, CLIENTNOTICES, CLIENTERRORS\n        + autoignoring msg and ctcp flooders\n        + options page added to preferences\n        + invite lists (channel mode I)\n        + !channels should work now\n        + replaced quite a lot of g_new()'s with GStrings. fixed one buffer\n          overflow with this also..\n        + /AWAYALL - sends /away to all connected servers\n        + /KNOCKOUT [secs] <nick> <reason> - kick+ban+delay (5min)+unban\n        - nick completion was case-sensitive\n        - again some minor bugs fixed and features added\n\nv0.2.1 1999-01-17  Timo Sirainen <a@sicom.fi>\n\n\t+ Preferences: color and font selection\n        + gnome-stuff.c has some gnome_* compatible functions to get GTK+\n          version work.

Very confusing\n\n16:39 <@Qrczak> cras: I'm not sure how exactly to reproduce it but it happens \n                often. When I jump to the window with a query using Alt-a \n                (after the other person said something), and close the window \n                (being brought to the last used window), and don't switch \n                windows, and then that person says something again, I'm brought \n                to the new query window automatically (that's of course bad).\n\n - import libsoup GnuTLS driver\n   http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/libsoup/trunk/libsoup/soup-gnutls.c?view=log\n - lastlog, ignore, hilight and sb levelclear take a list of levels\n   argument in different ways, a uniform way would be better.\n - /exec - -out cat file does not send the whole file\n - %n%_ won't show at lastlog..\n - use_status_window, use_msgs_window should work instantly..\n - /set show_server_tags or something to always show (combine with hide_server_tagsin ?)..\n - /SBAR topic placement bottom won't work??..\n - /op * complaining could be better than \"not a good idea\"..\n - how did tab completion complete your own nick..?\n - /win hide could work even though there are sticky things in that window..\n - /window server -sticky windows doesn't always realize when a server connects?..\n - tab completion doesn't work properly if I add utf8 things?..\n - utf8-texts tend to bug in statusbar (prompt)..\n - if /set reuse_unused_windows off, and the window seems to be empty,\n   and there would be only one of them it could still be used (?)..\n - /foreach server /disconnect $tag n8 does not work\n - /whowas server nick does not work\n - /msg nick@server or nick%host is fully treated as nickname (log, query)\n - max_whois won't stay with reconnects?\n - separate format for privmsg/notice massmessages (anything non-yournick)\n - set TOS field for all connections (DCC especially)\n - \"show statusbar in empty windows\" flag?\n - statusbar_item_redraw() should just set the size as dirty and calculate\n   it only when really needed.\n - possible to cache sbar_item->size when nothing else has changed in sbar? \n   ie. mostly when redrawing.\n - /msg @#chan<tab>\n - /SB GOTO -<days> <ts>\n - /query -immortal so autoclose_query wouldn't touch them\n - autoclose_query is also closing (and finishing) dcc chats (bug #59 ?)\n - write about %[-s] etc. to default.theme\n - away handling is a bit buggy. you do /away;/away reason, irssi remembers\n   the away reason only until it receives \"you're no longer away\" from the\n   first command.. setting it back to away has then lost the reason.\n - nick_ nick- _nick nick2 nick3 ...\n - /SAVE -all?\n - /STATUSBAR xx ENABLE|DISABLE recreates all statusbars which is a bit\n   annoying because some scripts want to do it and input line is cleared\n   because of this..\n - /SET disconnect_timeout - default 2min, 0 = immediately\n - reconnecting messages are a bit confusing. it prints \"removed reconnection\"\n   to the server which it's connecting to next.. maybe the whole reconnecting\n   thing should work so that the record stays there until it's connected\n   successfully.\n - /set beep_msg_level hilight won't work if I have /hilight -word\n - /hilight -priority is broken\n - move /SET hilight_*color to theme\n - /ignore, /hilight and /lastlog could complain immediately if used\n   regexp is broken. /hilight list could show also if it's broken like\n   /ignore does.\n\n - /UPGRADE:\n    - support DCCs\n    - rewrite to work by fork()ing a new process and transfer file handles\n      with unix sockets. this would allow the scrollback buffers to be\n      transferred with them as well.\n    - current window layout needs to transferred\n    - reconnections aren't transferred(?)\n\n - Logging:\n    - /LOG OPEN -targets *!*cras@*.fi\n    - /SET autolog -> /LOG OPEN -targets * (internally, at least)\n    - /LOG OPEN shouldn't really open the file until first line is \n      written in it\n    - autoclosing logs doesn't work too well. Problems are:\n\t- after certain inactivity private message logs should be closed\n\t- but DCC chats shouldn't be closed until the chat itself is closed\n\t   - which we can't know really currently, since they don't need\n\t     to be in queries\n\t- channels should be closed when they're left (they are now, but)\n\t   - /WINDOW CLOSE shouldn't close it immediately, since we'll still\n\t     receive at least the PART message\n    - so, log items should know more about what they are exactly, and when\n      they should be closed. private messages could have the same timeout\n      as now, time_t closetime field updated every time msg is received.\n      channels could do the same when receiving \"window item destroy\" signal,\n      except with a small timeout. DCC chats are more problematic...\n    - support for mirc/ansi color logging\n    - people want to show ignored stuff in logs.. how?\n    - private messages could show mirc-style \"Session Ident: nick (host)\"\n      which would update when nick's host changes. Then you wouldn't need to\n      print the host before each msg.\n    - support for logging channel messages from specific people\n\n - Awaylogs:\n    - either fully support logging only in servers you're away, or change the\n      awaylog to open immediately after /AWAY command, not based on any\n      away replies from server. Maybe the later would be better, since you\n      would want to set yourself away when connections to all servers were\n      disconnected at the time.. Maybe /AWAY should update status in\n      reconnection records as well?..\n    - /SET awaylog_auto_delete, after setting yourself unaway\n    - support for using strftime() formats (and $tag etc). only problem with\n      this is that all the different awaylogs would need to be tracked and\n      /CATed when setting yourself unaway\n    - /AWAYLOG could show the current awaylog and optionally reset it\n    - The channel name should be optional there\n    - after /upgrade when being away the awaylog is not being written to.\n\n - Window item placing:\n    - !channel vs. !12345channel. it's layout saved with full name, but joined\n      with either one\n    - when dcc chat is accepted and query exists from the same nick, replace\n      the query window with the dcc chat window.\n    - closed DCC chats should add temporary window bind to the dcc chat so\n      future chats for same nick would use the same window\n\n - DCC\n    - /DCC SEND wildcard support\n    - /DCC GET -4 / -6 with autodetection\n    - When we receive a DCC SEND request, irssi could warn if the file\n      already exists\n    - show estimated time left and kB/s in /DCC list.\n    - implement requesting files with DCC GET from remote client for dcc file\n      servers. good for people behind firewalls. Does this feature exist\n      in other clients, or should I create DCC REQUEST? Same for DCC CHAT..\n      Maybe it could be just that the port was specified as 0, so the other\n      side would know that it needs to be the one to do listening.\n    - /SET dcc_autoresume ON, and sending the same file again while it's\n      already being downloaded doesn't work too well.. Even autorename doesn't\n      work.\n    - With fast DCC SENDs (90kB/s, FreeBSD) typing get laggy (really?)\n    - /DCC CLOSE #, /DCC would print the IDs\n    - /SET dcc_use_proxy to use IRC proxy for DCC connects as well\n    - support for special vars in /SET dcc_download_path, so $N could be used\n    - No way to autoclose dcc chat windows which have been closed by another\n      side.\n\n - Generic chat commands:\n    - /MSG /CTCP /ACTION =dcc_chat,#channel\n    - /ACTION -ircnet with good tab support like in /MSG\n    - -nick -channel parameters to /ACTION\n    - /MSG a,b,#c,#d - it should print the message to #c and #d channel\n      windows and show only \"a,b\" as target when printing it to msg window..\n      Or if autoquery is set, it should print them to those windows. Hmm.\n      maybe some multipeople query support? :) /query nick1,nick2 and sending\n      text there would send it to both. Seems to work already but receiving\n      messages from either nick1 or nick2 don't go to that window..\n    - /BAN: setting of what netmask to use for banning with IPv6 addresses\n\n - Netsplits\n    - BUG: said \"+1 more\", while the /SETs to control that were set properly,\n      with one guy it only said that +1 more..\n    - BUG: netsplit quit isn't printed if quit -> join -> quit -> join\n      happens fast (really?)\n    - maybe the \"+x more\" should be configured in theme file instead in\n      future with the embedded scripting.. At least I'd want to print all\n      the splitted nicks in log files.\n    - per-window listing of splitted servers, it looks very stupid when\n      you see 4 lines of servers splitting in each window but only a few\n      nicks after them.\n    - per-window listing of splitted nicks, so the split messages isn't shown\n      multiple times for each channel with possibly same nicks\n    - /NETSPLIT <server>|<#channel>|<nick wildcard>\n    - SERVERMODE +ov nick nick is shown instead of just Netjoin @nick because\n      code is stupid. fixed in irssi-rewrite..\n    - show in query windows\n\n - Crashes:\n    - <dg> i've managed to reproduce the bug, if i make three split windows (/window show 3..5), then set the windows to not be sticky  and go to one of the windows, then alt+number to another window then go back the other window the display prints two windows in the same window\n    - the old irssi's /upgrades to the new, before it changed to /set autolog_path\n      $1 and crashed?..\n    - active_mainwin was somehow NULL and crashed.. /window kill did it,\n      probably something to do with window_close() switching to the same\n      hidden window inside the split window, which I was about to kill\n      anyways because it wasn't sticky..\n\n - Scripts:\n    - print whois in active window\n    - some script to handle ctcp floods, like doing /IGNORE * CTCPS when it \n      happens.\n    - move into scripts:\n       - /SET timestamp_timeout\n       - /MSG completion list should be modifiable from scripts\n          - script to remove nick from list after /IGNORE nick\n       - nick completion list should be modifyable afterwards:\n          - /SET completion_nicks_lowercase (remove from irssi)\n          - /SET completion_nicks_capitalize\n          - /SET completion_nicks_strip (keep only alphanumeric chars)\n    - irchat-like JOIN/PART/QUIT combiner (QUIT: nick1, nick2, nick3), would\n      require the line replacing work properly which it doesn't..\n\n - Irssi proxy:\n    - doesn't propagate your own nickchanges to other clients\n    - list sessions, kill them\n    - /set irssi_proxy_ips <allow connections only from specified IPs>\n\n - Misc IRC related things:\n    - support for mode +q in dancer - also same as +b %xxx modes..\n    - /BAN -ip, -time [<time>] (/ALIAS knockout?)\n    - /KICKBAN to support same options than /BAN (would /ALIAS kickban work?)\n    - ban list prints \"x seconds ago\" .. should be x days, mins, hours, ..\n\n - Windows:\n     - /WINDOW SIZE -sticky, so f.e. /WINDOW BALANCE wouldn't affect it.\n     - Check that /LAYOUT SAVE works properly with all the different /SETs,\n       like reuse_unsued_windows, windows_auto_renumber and autoclose_windows.\n       What should it do if some channel is /PARTed with autoclose_windows \n       set?..\n     - /LAYOUT SAVE  should ask if we want to save those window items that\n       are \"bound sticky\" but of which server is currently not connected.\n     - /WINDOW scrollback_lines /WINDOW scrollback_hours\n     - Optionally always start the lines from bottom of the screen when \n       screen is empty (how would scrolling work?)\n     - Vertically split windows\n     - /SET use_msgs_window and /SET use_status_window should take effect\n       immediately\n     - /WINDOW notify_level - would specify what window activity will be\n       shown for the window\n     - Some sort of autobalancing for split windows after terminal resize,\n       maybe with window-specific options that \"this window is n lines\",\n       \"this is at least n% of available space\", etc.\n\n - Keyboard handling:\n    - Some kind of state support for it, so it would be possible to make\n      support for vi keys easily.\n    - Editor-like (or bash-like) line editor - it would wrap to next line\n      instead of scrolling.\n    - When pasting text, irssi could send some signal that sends the pasted\n      lines in GList which signal handlers could modify.\n        - Already existing / at start of line handler should use this\n        - Automatically remove empty space at the start/end of lines,\n\t  from start of line it would work so that if each line begins with\n\t  4 spaces but some more, it would only remove those 4 spaces from\n\t  each so pasting code wouldn't mess up indents etc.\n\t- Skip all autoreplaces and completions, so that f.e. tabs are\n\t  printed as-is (a few /BINDs would do this but...)\n\t- Should empty lines be pasted too? Maybe optionally\n    - /BIND -askkey command\n    - /BIND -delete should be saved in config\n    - ^W (and some others) don't update cut buffer.\n    - default binds: M-d, M-y\n    - /PASSWORD command that asks you to type the password to entry line and\n      would hide it with asterisks, good if people spy on you :)\n    - ^R-like history search\n    - Key to execute the command, but not place it in history\n    - Key to remove active entry from command history\n    - Optionally save command history between restarts\n    - clear_history\n\n - Notify list:\n    - showing who's online and who's offline doesn't work properly.\n    - adding/removing people in notify list don't show in /NOTIFY immediately\n    - when someone in notify list joins, should it be placed to start of\n      /MSG completion list?\n    - /NOTIFY -away and -idle: support for wildcards in nicks (requires of\n      course that we're in same channel as nick)\n    - Automatically add queried nicks to notify list temporarily .. display\n      the notifys for the nick in the query window\n    - /NOTIFY -once - notify only once when the user comes to IRC, forget\n      this after it.\n    - /NOTIFY -comment xxx - add a comment to notify. print the comment when\n      user comes to irc.\n    - \"Should we check people in notify list when you're away\" option\n    - use /WATCH instead of /ISON in servers that support it\n    - Show when the nick was last seen\n\n - Ignores:\n    - /IGNORE <nick> -> use hostmasking (related to channel syncing problem,\n      see \"bigger code changes\") with support for -type and /SET ignore_type\n    - /IGNORE -strip -pattern away * actions ..\n    - can't have multiple ignore -patterns with same nick\n    - /ignore -activity .. would ignore it just in window activity list,\n      not hide the text.\n    - The nick cache stuff just made it slower. Remove it or figure out how\n      it could be faster.\n    - combined ignore/hilight thingy, see hilights\n\n - Hilights:\n    - /HILIGHT list doesn't print several options. Maybe some generic\n      function which could be used for printing those options for all these\n      /IRCNET, /SERVER ADD, etc. commands.\n    - /HILIGHT -mask <mask> <word>: not possible use both.\n    - case sensitive hilight checking.\n    - ignore coloring in the words it matches, so eg. /hilight foo would\n      match to f^Bo^Bo\n    - BUG: it STILL sometimes creates hilight activity while there's no\n      hilights, around mode changes (haven't heard for a while though,\n      maybe it is anyway fixed? :)\n    - change the colors of both the nick and the matched word.\n    - /SET hide_text_style still breaks /HILIGHT -words\n    - even if hilight_color is \"\", %n is printed after hilighted text.\n    - /hilight -actcolor %M -color %w -regexp -level publics\n               -channels #channel1,#channel2 .*\n      removes the bold from /me actions of other users\n    - people want to hilight their own nicks everywhere, eg. /HILIGHT $N\n    - automatic nick hilighting at beginning of line should be optional,\n      like some people would want -word hilighting in it..\n    - exceptions\n    - Merged ignores/hilights thingy and maybe even something others ..\n      some first-match-wins table where you could easily add/move stuff.\n\n - Scrollback:\n    - Optionally show a \"bookmark\" (line mark actually, a line full of '-'\n      chars) in a window. It would be displayed at the position where you\n      were when the window was active last time. /MARK command to force\n      updating it to bottom of screen in active window.\n    - /SCROLLBACK REDRAW doesn't do anything to non-format lines (should\n      redraw timestamp, etc.)\n    - /LAST -since <timestamp>\n    - /LAST : use /SET timestamp_format\n    - /LAST -allwindows would check the lastlog from all open windows\n\n - Formats / themes:\n    - scripting for formats (see the themes.txt), and make the default.theme\n      so that you REALLY don't need to touch /FORMATs, unless you want to\n      change english texts (eg. joins/parts/quits etc. are fully configurable\n      in theme file)\n    - Possibility to modify abstracts and replaces in themes from irssi.\n      (or maybe not, just makes it more difficult)\n    - Document the different formats briefly :)\n    - /FORMATs don't have styling anymore, so translation to different\n      languages should be possible with still the ability to use different\n      themes easily. /SET formats <filename> could change the file where\n      to read all /FORMATs, but formats in theme file would override them.\n    - terminfo/termcap supports changing palette. add support for themes\n      as well to specify it.\n    - hilight formats. pubaction_hilight would be nice, but so would many\n      others as well. something generic for all these would be nice .. would\n      it be possible to do this in theme side with scripting without a\n      format for each different thing?\n\n - Server commands:\n    - Optionally wait for a while (0.5-1sec) before sending the message to\n      server, if arrow up key is pressed abort it. Also remove the line from\n      screen and put some notice about it being not sent.\n    - If we receive \"cannot send to channel\" from server or \"you're not \n      chanop\" events, remove the privmsgs/notices or modes/kicks/etc. from\n      send queue automatically. Useful for aborting things when you get\n      kicked after pasting lots of text or deopped after doing /OP * or\n      something ;) .. use /SERVER PURGE <target> for this..\n    - Split PRIVMSGs and NOTICEs automatically to multiple commands if\n      their length exceeds the 512 bytes (or it should be shorter actually\n      so server won't split it when it adds your nick+host mask)\n    - Fix the flood protection to be aware of max. input buffer, which is\n      1024 bytes by default (/STATS d, CF). Now irssi may excess flood when\n      sending lots of lines longer than ~200 chars.\n    - IRCNET: Flood protection doesn't count the extra penalty for MODEs\n      and KICKs, also extra penalty should be given in messages (all\n      commands?) for each 100 chars.\n\n - Text buffer:\n    - support for printing ALL characters in text buffer, including ^B, ^C,\n      etc. etc. so we could selectively decide what mirc colors to translate\n      and what not. Like, we would want to show (or hide) it in normal\n      messages, but we would want to show it as-is in user's ident and\n      ban lists. This should fix /HILIGHT -word as well.\n    - EPIC-like /SET mangle_inbound, maybe mangle_outbound?\n    - %> should work in normal text lines\n    - support for iso-2022-jp? does anyone even want this? ;) it works with\n      esc$B..encoded text...esc(B - encoded text is in 7bit chars, not sure\n    - fix the textbuffer code so that typofix.pl actually works\n    - if you're in beginning of scrollback when lines are being removed,\n      the screen is messed up (?). Also, after /SB END the --more-- is\n      still there and you can't get rid of it (couldn't reproduce)\n    - does /SB REFRESH work? Make it update the lines lazily, only when\n      needed so it would be fast.\n    - Make /SET HOLD_MODE\n    - /CAT should pause on every screenful of text, this should be some kind\n      of printtext_multiline_paused() function which would use some callback\n      to ask for new text.\n    - when scrolling, using pgup/down. it would be neat if the last/first\n      overlapping line in the newly redrawn buffer would be colorized for a\n      second or two, indicating where to continue reading\n\n - Statusbar\n    - finish the support for multiple statusbar groups, and add\n      /WINDOW STATUSBAR command.\n    - finish the support for multiple input lines and a way to switch\n      between them, so eg. each split window could have it's own input line.\n    - padding char so instead of just spaces you could have ------\n    - hide the whole statusbar if none of it's items use any space\n      (visible = \"auto\")\n    - /SBAR # PLACEMENT top|bottom sometimes messes up the screen a bit,\n      ^L helps though\n    - /STATUSBAR prompt DISABLE hangs irssi because there's no input line.\n      Add some check to not allow this.\n    - /STATUSBAR could list also disabled bars\n    - command to list all available statusbar items\n\n - Server connecting:\n    - More verbose connecting\n        - show if we're using IPv4 or IPv6\n\t- show hostname we're using\n\t- show the proxy settings we're using\n    - Reconnecting shouldn't try to remember all those settings, especially\n      /SET real_name xx + /RECONNECT should work.\n    - DNS problems may cause removal of i-line, irssi shouldn't stop\n      trying to reconnect the server if it happens.. Maybe it never should\n      stop reconnecting to servers that are in config.\n    - Remember the previous IP while reconnecting, if DNS lookup fails use\n      it. Some DNS servers return \"host not found\" when their internet\n      connection is broken and irssi stops reconnecting..\n    - /RECONNECT <servertag> - If <servertag> belongs to some IRC network,\n      reconnect to next server in that ircnet, otherwise just reconnect\n      to the server.\n    - /SERVER <number> would connect to n'th server in list. Show the\n      numbers with /SERVER LIST\n    - /CONNECT <ircnet> could remove existing ircnet connection from\n      reconnect queue if it exists (only if there's only one?). Also if\n      we're already connected to the ircnet it could complain about it\n      and -yes would force it.\n    - connect() may be stuck forever, timeout it after a few minutes.\n    - Raise the reconnect time every time you get disconnected, so if your\n      network goes up/down all the time, we'd see you join/part channels\n      more and more often instead of flooding all the time.\n    - Better support for round robin addresses (eg. irc.openprojects.org)\n    - /CONNECT -raw? A bit like telnet/nc host.\n\n - Tab completion:\n    - Command parameter completion doesn't work properly when -options \n      are used.\n    - Possibility to complete -option parameters? Like -ircnet <tab>, also\n      /MSG -servertag<tab> and /LAST -level<tab> should work. All of these\n      require some command definition changes..\n    - bash-style (or whatever it should be called) tab-completion\n    - key for reverse completion\n    - /MSG <tab> completion shouldn't include queried nick there (optional)\n    - File completion could guess when it's wanted, word beginning with /\n      (not at start of line of course, unless / isn't in cmdchars)\n      or ~/ or ./\n    - filename completion doesn't work properly if path has spaces\n    - /FORMAT xx <tab>\n    - don't add useless completions to list. eg /RUN nick<tab> shouldn't \n      work\n    - Priorities to completions. And at least command completion could use\n      it so it'd put last the commands that require chanops/ircops.\n      Requires support in command_bind().\n    - /DCC commands could complete nicks (/dcc close, /dcc get, ..)\n    - check the TODO about nick completion scripts..\n\n - Modules:\n    - Figure out module vs. plugin wording, what is what ;)\n    - API for plugins which would be guaranteed not to change\n      (at least too much/too often :)\n    - \"chat protocol modules\" - they could be loaded at startup so they'd be\n      equal to IRC protocol (autoconnecting servers would work etc.)\n    - on-demand autoload modules (f.e. by /command or maybe some signal)\n    - Try to make them create only .so files instead of .a and all..\n    - dependencies for modules? double /[un]load prints a bit stupid text\n\n - perl scripting:\n    - /LOAD [-script | -module], /UNLOAD script\n    - Possibility to modify entry line somehow\n    - Add structures: MODULE_REC, THEME_REC, KEYINFO_REC, \n      CHAT_PROTOCOL_REC, etc.\n    - signal_emit() - if emitting unknown signal, it could automatically\n      save the types of sent parameters so another perl script could\n      signal_add() it\n    - Irssi::keyboard_entry_redirect()\n    - Irssi::format_get_text()\n    - Irssi::signal_remove() could accept hashes\n    - /command parameter parser so it'd be easier to handle -options etc.\n    - Try to get the Makefiles generated so that compiling with GCC would\n      always work even if the perl wasn't compiled with GCC..\n    - Irssi::Timeout_add() and input_add()'s data option could be optional\n      and maybe allow multiple parameters\n\n - Bigger code changes:\n    - Restructure code tree so that non-IRC chat protocols would be in\n      same places than IRC protocol. Something like:\n        - src/irc (like now)\n\t- src/irc/fe-common, src/irc/fe-text\n      SILC could then make symlinks to src/silc to whereever the SILC\n      module was unpacked. Make it possible to build SILC support built-in.\n    - /SETs have now boolean/number/string types. Add more:\n        - Time: Allow to use s|m|h|d to specify the time, default to\n          seconds. When sending reply to user, use the time formatting too,\n          not just x seconds or minutes. \"10d 5s\" should also work.\n\t- Level: Like \"all -msgs -public\". Complain about unknown strings.\n\t- size: 5M, 5k, ..\n    - Reading configuration file should be changed somehow .. at least add\n      some helper functions for reading lists since comments inside them\n      now crash irssi. Also if setting wasn't expected type can cause\n      crashes so add proper error checkings everywhere. And is_node_list()\n      etc. should be in uppercase..\n    - Channel syncing is evil. Make it optional, and use /USERHOST when\n      needed if host isn't known. /BAN at least should do this, and while\n      at it, we could make /IGNORE as well to ignore based on mask. Also,\n      if /USERHOST doesn't find anything, use /WHOWAS info.\n    - Irssi saves some setting strings to static const char * variables in\n      several places.. this works pretty well usually, except when /RELOADing\n      config and some \"setup changed\" signal handler goes and calls some\n      function that still uses the old saved string which points to free'd\n      memory.. this should somehow be fixed failsafe. maybe just g_strdup()\n      them everywhere or figure out something better..\n    - Better priority specifying for signals, probably should add\n      int priority without limited range.\n    - fix server redirections to handle remote events correctly: very unlikely,\n      but its possible that replies to two remote whoises are received exactly\n      at the same time overlapping each others\n\n - Commands:\n    - try to get the 0.9 command parser to work..\n    - user definable parameter definitions and how they're handled, like\n      cmsg <target> <colorized-msg> - then there'd be some function called to\n      colorize the third parameter. same for tab completion.\n    - support for multiple subcommands in the command parser, like\n      /window name foo level msgs.\n    - A way to disable some command entirely? eg. not show in completion\n      list or /HELP or anywhere..\n\n - extra spaces after commands don't always work, eg /wii  nick, /help  xx\n - hide channel key in statusbar. This would require a $cmode_nokey or\n   something..\n - fe-none doesn't compile with --with-perl-staticlib because it doesn't find\n   the ui/textui stuff..\n - we should probably print timestamp even if level contains MSGLEVEL_NEVER,\n   as long as it's not the only level.. Except when /CATing awaylog we don't\n   want to do that.\n - If /SET print_active_channel is ON, actions still don't show the channel\n - nick's user/host can't be printed for public messages\n - /HELP <alias> should work\n - /CLEAR -all should clear the window activities as well, leaving hilights\n - support :: properly in IPv6 masks\n - when you get disconnected, print your quit message to all channel windows\n - possibility to print rawlog in window\n - should $10 work (in special vars)?\n - /VER should be alias\n - /MODE #channel b should resync the banlist, and /QUOTE NAMES #channel\n   should resync the nicklist (irssi/ircd bugs).\n - #include support to config file\n - make detaching work\n - with solaris, /EXECs don't die when irssi does (tail -f ...)\n - /EXEC -interactive: print the commands you send\n - handle /JOINs with server redirections so they get aborted if we're not\n   seing a JOIN for a while.\n - make sure the config file is never lost, write it to some temp file first\n   and after then move it over real config file.\n - you could configure which events (whois, notify, etc.) to show in what\n   windows (all, current, status, msgs)\n - /SET -reset?\n - printnickmsg() which would print nick changes and quit messages. And\n   export that function to perl so kills.pl could print kills with it too.\n - regexp host masks\n - automatically switch to status window when using commands that always\n   print their output to status window, like /whois.\n - automatic whowas if whois wasn't found should be moved to fe-common.\n   it could also print something like \"nick $0 not in IRC, but this user\n   WAS in IRC:\"\n - Add command for changing automatic replaces and completions\n   (/autoreplace, /complete ?) .. could these be scripts? ..\n - commands to move channels and servers in the config list, to set the\n   join/connect order of them.\n - All those options to /WHO and /LIST commands that EPIC has\n - Use different formats for /WHO #channel? There's no need to show the\n   channel in every line then (NOTE: /WHO #chan1,#chan2 should have two\n   headers)\n - nick/channel lists at right side of the text version of irssi. Ctrl-N\n   for example could hide/show them. add mouse support for it.\n\n - try profiling the code with /cat filewith10000lines\n - /SERVER ADD -ircnet foonet bar 6000 pass1,\n   /SERVER ADD -ircnet barnet bar 6000 pass2\n   dircproxy identifies ircnets based on password\n - $@0 always returns 4 (?)\n\n\n*** GTK UI\n\n - %| doesn't work with irssi text widget\n - some problems when using multiple windows with focus being all the time in\n   one of the windows and it can't be changed to different window?! Probably\n   has something to do with click to focus.\n - split windows are buggy, destroying them doesn't really work well..\n - mirc ctcp togglemenuitem isn't updated right\n\n*** Big things\n\n - some sort of address book? our own irssi ctcp to ask for other irssi users\n   for their information (of course not without asking (except optionally))..\n   could be nice also to automatically update it, keep track of all seen\n   users gathered when joining channels, whois, who, etc. commands.\n   automatically updating information could be host masks, nicks, ips, seen in\n   channels, operator in channels, .. user specified checks like last topic or\n   mode changes or even msgs to you/some channel/with some keyword. great for\n   spying people ;) maybe even useful sometimes..\n\n   .. but what database would be best for this?\n\n - GTK (non-GNOME) version: icons to toolbars, accelerators to menus\n - Windows style MDI windows are possible with GtkFixed .. Some people would\n   like this.. too much job for me, it would need building the MDI windows\n   ourself (title bar, borders, resizing, etc.)\n\n - online help, documentation, ...\n - plugins:\n     - scheme, tcl, python scripting? eggdrop/epic compatible scripting?\n     - IRC bot, eggdrop is too old, needs a replacement ;) (started, aborted)\n     - Multiplayer games! :) Chess, tic-tac-toe, othello, battleship, tetris,\n       etc. Existing games should probably be used .. though there doesn't\n       seem to be any of these (except tetris) for gnome right now..\n     - audio / video chat :)\n\n*** Needs rethinking ..\n\n * Notify list GUI\n - _one_ popup dialog could open which lists all nicks in notifylist, maybe\n   sorted by arrival time, display the dates, latest joined could be with\n   different color? etc.\n - nick-specific options:\n    - pop up the dialog\n    - run some command (like /exec as soon as I get that done :)\n\n * common api for statusbar handling\n - it should work just as well in text mode and gui, colors could be done\n   with the normal % formats. GUI just ignores the colors..\n - display number of ops, voices, normals and ircops in statusbar\n\n * API for creating/modifying menus and toolbar, especially from plugins\n - at least one configurable menu (\"usermenu\"), or maybe make the whole\n   menubar user configurable\n\n\n*** ..in GTK UI .. just some things to remember if i'll rewrite it again.\n\n - itext:\n     - save/find text\n     - text selection draws the entire selection every time you move the\n       mouse...\n     - if some other window has got much text, switching to it first time\n       takes some time..?\n - editor in setup for ~/.irssi/startup\n - dcc floods could pop up lots of dialogs..\n - gui help\n - change signal handling in gui-gnome so that the actual drawing and\n   functionality are in different signals, so that plugin could change the\n   whole look and feel of irssi.\n - currently irssi sends USERHOST commands every now and then to find out\n   who are away and who are not.. optionally it could instead just watch if\n   someone hasn't written anything to channel in n minutes and mark it \"away\"\n   to nicklist.\n - check new irssi versions with http rather than with irssibot..\n - gnome statubar:\n    - clock?\n    - dcc transfer meter (gtk progressbar)\n - dcc send: allow selection of multiple files to send (also for dnd from\n   gmc!)
