We do not have releases and\nthere do not expect to have a regular updating schedule as we use this\nto mostly post security advisories pertaining to security research.\n\nThat being said, we do expect to have proof-of-concept code accompanying\nthose advisories from time to time. These will certainly, at some point,\nneed patching, so we welcome contributions for those. There are just a\nfew small guidelines you need to follow.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor\nLicense Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to\nyour contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and\nredistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to\n<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on\nfile or to sign a new one.\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already\nsubmitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably\ndon't need to do it again.\n\n## Code reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require\nreview. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub\nHelp](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more\ninformation on using pull requests.\n\n## Community Guidelines\n\nThis project follows [Google's Open Source Community\nGuidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).\n\n"
