It will not receive any feature updates, only critical security bug patches. On May 1st, 2023, the repo will be fully archived.**\n\n--------------------\n\n## Introduction\nProfilo is an Android library for collecting performance *traces* from production builds of an app.\n\n## Index\n\n1. [Getting started](https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/docs/getting-started)\n2. [Internal architecture](https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/docs/architecture)\n3. [Trace processing and analysis](https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/docs/trace-processing)\n\n## APIs\n\nCurrently, none of the APIs are stable and they *will* change (mostly so that they're easier to use) before release.\n\n## Sample usage\n\nThe sample app in `java/main/com/facebook/profilo/sample` shows the most basic usage of the APIs.\n\nYou can also find the prebuilt apk in the Releases section.\n\n## Demos\n\nA demo script can be found in `python/profilo/workflow_demo.py`. It contains examples of simple\nanalysis that can be run on Profilo traces. For more information see the [trace processing](https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/docs/trace-processing.html) section of the docs.\n\n## License\nProfilo is Apache 2 licensed, as found in the LICENSE file.\n"
