I am only posting these here for the enjoyment and reminiscing of the spark that ignited a soon to be trillion dollar industry. Enjoy. :)   \n\nYou guys might be able to play around building this compilier with Aiju's pdp-11/unix emulator. I havent tried building this myself so I cant confirm it works, but I posted the link to her emulator for anybody wanting to hack around with it.\n\nSource: [https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/primevalC.html] alt-link [http://cm.bell-labs.co/who/dmr/primevalC.html]\n\n*Useful Links*\n\nPDP-11 Emulator: [http://pdp11.aiju.de/] (so i've been playing around with this to see if it still works, and it clearly has problems right now. if somebody wants to try and create like a VM image of unix running on PDP-7 hardware, id happily link to it here.)\n\nResearch Unix Repository: [https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/]\n"
