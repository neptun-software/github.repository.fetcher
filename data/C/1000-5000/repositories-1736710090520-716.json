By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n"

          "content": "Installing the GNU C Library\n****************************\n\nBefore you do anything else, you should read the FAQ at\n<https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/FAQ>.  It answers common questions\nand describes problems you may experience with compilation and\ninstallation.\n\n   You will need recent versions of several GNU tools: definitely GCC\nand GNU Make, and possibly others.  *Note Tools for Compilation::,\nbelow.\n\nConfiguring and compiling the GNU C Library\n===========================================\n\nThe GNU C Library cannot be compiled in the source directory.  You must\nbuild it in a separate build directory.  For example, if you have\nunpacked the GNU C Library sources in '/src/gnu/glibc-VERSION', create a\ndirectory '/src/gnu/glibc-build' to put the object files in.  This\nallows removing the whole build directory in case an error occurs, which\nis the safest way to get a fresh start and should always be done.\n\n   From your object directory, run the shell script 'configure' located\nat the top level of the source tree.  In the scenario above, you'd type\n\n     $ ../glibc-VERSION/configure ARGS...\n\n   Please note that even though you're building in a separate build\ndirectory, the compilation may need to create or modify files and\ndirectories in the source directory.\n\n'configure' takes many options, but the only one that is usually\nmandatory is '--prefix'.  This option tells 'configure' where you want\nthe GNU C Library installed.  This defaults to '/usr/local', but the\nnormal setting to install as the standard system library is\n'--prefix=/usr' for GNU/Linux systems and '--prefix=' (an empty prefix)\nfor GNU/Hurd systems.\n\n   It may also be useful to pass 'CC=COMPILER' and 'CFLAGS=FLAGS'\narguments to 'configure'.  'CC' selects the C compiler that will be\nused, and 'CFLAGS' sets optimization options for the compiler.  Any\ncompiler options required for all compilations, such as options\nselecting an ABI or a processor for which to generate code, should be\nincluded in 'CC'.  Options that may be overridden by the GNU C Library\nbuild system for particular files, such as for optimization and\ndebugging, should go in 'CFLAGS'.  The default value of 'CFLAGS' is '-g\n-O2', and the GNU C Library cannot be compiled without optimization, so\nif 'CFLAGS' is specified it must enable optimization.  For example:\n\n     $ ../glibc-VERSION/configure CC=\"gcc -m32\" CFLAGS=\"-O3\"\n\n   The following list describes all of the available options for\n'configure':\n\n'--prefix=DIRECTORY'\n     Install machine-independent data files in subdirectories of\n     'DIRECTORY'.  The default is to install in '/usr/local'.\n\n'--exec-prefix=DIRECTORY'\n     Install the library and other machine-dependent files in\n     subdirectories of 'DIRECTORY'.  The default is to the '--prefix'\n     directory if that option is specified, or '/usr/local' otherwise.\n\n'--with-headers=DIRECTORY'\n     Look for kernel header files in DIRECTORY, not '/usr/include'.  The\n     GNU C Library needs information from the kernel's header files\n     describing the interface to the kernel.  The GNU C Library will\n     normally look in '/usr/include' for them, but if you specify this\n     option, it will look in DIRECTORY instead.\n\n     This option is primarily of use on a system where the headers in\n     '/usr/include' come from an older version of the GNU C Library.\n     Conflicts can occasionally happen in this case.  You can also use\n     this option if you want to compile the GNU C Library with a newer\n     set of kernel headers than the ones found in '/usr/include'.\n\n'--enable-kernel=VERSION'\n     This option is currently only useful on GNU/Linux systems.  The\n     VERSION parameter should have the form X.Y.Z and describes the\n     smallest version of the Linux kernel the generated library is\n     expected to support.  The higher the VERSION number is, the less\n     compatibility code is added, and the faster the code gets.\n\n'--with-binutils=DIRECTORY'\n     Use the binutils (assembler and linker) in 'DIRECTORY', not the\n     ones the C compiler would default to.  You can use this option if\n     the default binutils on your system cannot deal with all the\n     constructs in the GNU C Library.  In that case, 'configure' will\n     detect the problem and suppress these constructs, so that the\n     library will still be usable, but functionality may be lost--for\n     example, you can't build a shared libc with old binutils.\n\n'--with-nonshared-cflags=CFLAGS'\n     Use additional compiler flags CFLAGS to build the parts of the\n     library which are always statically linked into applications and\n     libraries even with shared linking (that is, the object files\n     contained in 'lib*_nonshared.a' libraries).  The build process will\n     automatically use the appropriate flags, but this option can be\n     used to set additional flags required for building applications and\n     libraries, to match local policy.  For example, if such a policy\n     requires that all code linked into applications must be built with\n     source fortification,\n     '--with-nonshared-cflags=-Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2' will make sure\n     that the objects in 'libc_nonshared.a' are compiled with this flag\n     (although this will not affect the generated code in this\n     particular case and potentially change debugging information and\n     metadata only).\n\n'--disable-shared'\n     Don't build shared libraries even if it is possible.  Not all\n     systems support shared libraries; you need ELF support and\n     (currently) the GNU linker.\n\n'--enable-static-pie'\n     Enable static position independent executable (static PIE) support.\n     Static PIE is similar to static executable, but can be loaded at\n     any address without help from a dynamic linker.  All static\n     programs as well as static tests are built as static PIE, except\n     for those marked with no-pie.  The resulting glibc can be used with\n     the GCC option, -static-pie, which is available with GCC 8 or\n     above, to create static PIE. This option also implies that glibc\n     programs and tests are created as dynamic position independent\n     executables (PIE) by default.\n\n'--enable-cet'\n     Enable Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) support.\n     When the GNU C Library is built with '--enable-cet', the resulting\n     library is protected with indirect branch tracking (IBT) and shadow\n     stack (SHSTK).  When CET is enabled, the GNU C Library is\n     compatible with all existing executables and shared libraries.\n     This feature is currently supported on i386, x86_64 and x32 with\n     GCC 8 and binutils 2.29 or later.  Note that when CET is enabled,\n     the GNU C Library requires CPUs capable of multi-byte NOPs, like\n     x86-64 processors as well as Intel Pentium Pro or newer.\n\n     NOTE: '--enable-cet' has been tested for i686, x86_64 and x32 on\n     non-CET processors.  '--enable-cet' has been tested for x86_64 and\n     x32 on CET SDVs, but Intel CET support hasn't been validated for\n     i686.\n\n'--disable-profile'\n     Don't build libraries with profiling information.  You may want to\n     use this option if you don't plan to do profiling.\n\n'--enable-static-nss'\n     Compile static versions of the NSS (Name Service Switch) libraries.\n     This is not recommended because it defeats the purpose of NSS; a\n     program linked statically with the NSS libraries cannot be\n     dynamically reconfigured to use a different name database.\n\n'--enable-hardcoded-path-in-tests'\n     By default, dynamic tests are linked to run with the installed C\n     library.  This option hardcodes the newly built C library path in\n     dynamic tests so that they can be invoked directly.\n\n'--disable-timezone-tools'\n     By default, timezone related utilities ('zic', 'zdump', and\n     'tzselect') are installed with the GNU C Library.  If you are\n     building these independently (e.g.  by using the 'tzcode' package),\n     then this option will allow disabling the install of these.\n\n     Note that you need to make sure the external tools are kept in sync\n     with the versions that the GNU C Library expects as the data\n     formats may change over time.  Consult the 'timezone' subdirectory\n     for more details.\n\n'--enable-stack-protector'\n'--enable-stack-protector=strong'\n'--enable-stack-protector=all'\n     Compile the C library and all other parts of the glibc package\n     (including the threading and math libraries, NSS modules, and\n     transliteration modules) using the GCC '-fstack-protector',\n     '-fstack-protector-strong' or '-fstack-protector-all' options to\n     detect stack overruns.  Only the dynamic linker and a small number\n     of routines called directly from assembler are excluded from this\n     protection.\n\n'--enable-bind-now'\n     Disable lazy binding for installed shared objects.  This provides\n     additional security hardening because it enables full RELRO and a\n     read-only global offset table (GOT), at the cost of slightly\n     increased program load times.\n\n'--enable-pt_chown'\n     The file 'pt_chown' is a helper binary for 'grantpt' (*note\n     Pseudo-Terminals: Allocation.) that is installed setuid root to fix\n     up pseudo-terminal ownership.  It is not built by default because\n     systems using the Linux kernel are commonly built with the 'devpts'\n     filesystem enabled and mounted at '/dev/pts', which manages\n     pseudo-terminal ownership automatically.  By using\n     '--enable-pt_chown', you may build 'pt_chown' and install it setuid\n     and owned by 'root'.  The use of 'pt_chown' introduces additional\n     security risks to the system and you should enable it only if you\n     understand and accept those risks.\n\n'--disable-werror'\n     By default, the GNU C Library is built with '-Werror'.  If you wish\n     to build without this option (for example, if building with a newer\n     version of GCC than this version of the GNU C Library was tested\n     with, so new warnings cause the build with '-Werror' to fail), you\n     can configure with '--disable-werror'.\n\n'--disable-mathvec'\n     By default for x86_64, the GNU C Library is built with the vector\n     math library.  Use this option to disable the vector math library.\n\n'--enable-tunables'\n     Tunables support allows additional library parameters to be\n     customized at runtime.  This feature is enabled by default.  This\n     option can take the following values:\n\n     'yes'\n          This is the default if no option is passed to configure.  This\n          enables tunables and selects the default frontend (currently\n          'valstring').\n\n     'no'\n          This option disables tunables.\n\n     'valstring'\n          This enables tunables and selects the 'valstring' frontend for\n          tunables.  This frontend allows users to specify tunables as a\n          colon-separated list in a single environment variable\n          'GLIBC_TUNABLES'.\n\n'--enable-obsolete-nsl'\n     By default, libnsl is only built as shared library for backward\n     compatibility and the NSS modules libnss_compat, libnss_nis and\n     libnss_nisplus are not built at all.  Use this option to enable\n     libnsl with all depending NSS modules and header files.\n\n'--disable-crypt'\n     Do not install the passphrase-hashing library 'libcrypt' or the\n     header file 'crypt.h'.  'unistd.h' will still declare the function\n     'crypt'.  Using this option does not change the set of programs\n     that may need to be linked with '-lcrypt'; it only means that the\n     GNU C Library will not provide that library.\n\n     This option is for hackers and distributions experimenting with\n     independently-maintained implementations of libcrypt.  It may\n     become the default in a future release.\n\n'--disable-experimental-malloc'\n     By default, a per-thread cache is enabled in 'malloc'.  While this\n     cache can be disabled on a per-application basis using tunables\n     (set glibc.malloc.tcache_count to zero), this option can be used to\n     remove it from the build completely.\n\n'--build=BUILD-SYSTEM'\n'--host=HOST-SYSTEM'\n     These options are for cross-compiling.  If you specify both options\n     and BUILD-SYSTEM is different from HOST-SYSTEM, 'configure' will\n     prepare to cross-compile the GNU C Library from BUILD-SYSTEM to be\n     used on HOST-SYSTEM.  You'll probably need the '--with-headers'\n     option too, and you may have to override CONFIGURE's selection of\n     the compiler and/or binutils.\n\n     If you only specify '--host', 'configure' will prepare for a native\n     compile but use what you specify instead of guessing what your\n     system is.  This is most useful to change the CPU submodel.  For\n     example, if 'configure' guesses your machine as 'i686-pc-linux-gnu'\n     but you want to compile a library for 586es, give\n     '--host=i586-pc-linux-gnu' or just '--host=i586-linux' and add the\n     appropriate compiler flags ('-mcpu=i586' will do the trick) to\n     'CC'.\n\n     If you specify just '--build', 'configure' will get confused.\n\n'--with-pkgversion=VERSION'\n     Specify a description, possibly including a build number or build\n     date, of the binaries being built, to be included in '--version'\n     output from programs installed with the GNU C Library.  For\n     example, '--with-pkgversion='FooBar GNU/Linux glibc build 123''.\n     The default value is 'GNU libc'.\n\n'--with-bugurl=URL'\n     Specify the URL that users should visit if they wish to report a\n     bug, to be included in '--help' output from programs installed with\n     the GNU C Library.  The default value refers to the main\n     bug-reporting information for the GNU C Library.\n\n   To build the library and related programs, type 'make'.  This will\nproduce a lot of output, some of which may look like errors from 'make'\nbut aren't.  Look for error messages from 'make' containing '***'.\nThose indicate that something is seriously wrong.\n\n   The compilation process can take a long time, depending on the\nconfiguration and the speed of your machine.  Some complex modules may\ntake a very long time to compile, as much as several minutes on slower\nmachines.  Do not panic if the compiler appears to hang.\n\n   If you want to run a parallel make, simply pass the '-j' option with\nan appropriate numeric parameter to 'make'.  You need a recent GNU\n'make' version, though.\n\n   To build and run test programs which exercise some of the library\nfacilities, type 'make check'.  If it does not complete successfully, do\nnot use the built library, and report a bug after verifying that the\nproblem is not already known.  *Note Reporting Bugs::, for instructions\non reporting bugs.  Note that some of the tests assume they are not\nbeing run by 'root'.  We recommend you compile and test the GNU C\nLibrary as an unprivileged user.\n\n   Before reporting bugs make sure there is no problem with your system.\nThe tests (and later installation) use some pre-existing files of the\nsystem such as '/etc/passwd', '/etc/nsswitch.conf' and others.  These\nfiles must all contain correct and sensible content.\n\n   Normally, 'make check' will run all the tests before reporting all\nproblems found and exiting with error status if any problems occurred.\nYou can specify 'stop-on-test-failure=y' when running 'make check' to\nmake the test run stop and exit with an error status immediately when a\nfailure occurs.\n\n   To format the 'GNU C Library Reference Manual' for printing, type\n'make dvi'.  You need a working TeX installation to do this.  The\ndistribution builds the on-line formatted version of the manual, as Info\nfiles, as part of the build process.  You can build them manually with\n'make info'.\n\n   The library has a number of special-purpose configuration parameters\nwhich you can find in 'Makeconfig'.  These can be overwritten with the\nfile 'configparms'.  To change them, create a 'configparms' in your\nbuild directory and add values as appropriate for your system.  The file\nis included and parsed by 'make' and has to follow the conventions for\nmakefiles.\n\n   It is easy to configure the GNU C Library for cross-compilation by\nsetting a few variables in 'configparms'.  Set 'CC' to the\ncross-compiler for the target you configured the library for; it is\nimportant to use this same 'CC' value when running 'configure', like\nthis: 'configure TARGET CC=TARGET-gcc'.  Set 'BUILD_CC' to the compiler\nto use for programs run on the build system as part of compiling the\nlibrary.  You may need to set 'AR' to cross-compiling versions of 'ar'\nif the native tools are not configured to work with object files for the\ntarget you configured for.  When cross-compiling the GNU C Library, it\nmay be tested using 'make check\ntest-wrapper=\"SRCDIR/scripts/cross-test-ssh.sh HOSTNAME\"', where SRCDIR\nis the absolute directory name for the main source directory and\nHOSTNAME is the host name of a system that can run the newly built\nbinaries of the GNU C Library.  The source and build directories must be\nvisible at the same locations on both the build system and HOSTNAME.\n\n   In general, when testing the GNU C Library, 'test-wrapper' may be set\nto the name and arguments of any program to run newly built binaries.\nThis program must preserve the arguments to the binary being run, its\nworking directory and the standard input, output and error file\ndescriptors.  If 'TEST-WRAPPER env' will not work to run a program with\nenvironment variables set, then 'test-wrapper-env' must be set to a\nprogram that runs a newly built program with environment variable\nassignments in effect, those assignments being specified as 'VAR=VALUE'\nbefore the name of the program to be run.  If multiple assignments to\nthe same variable are specified, the last assignment specified must take\nprecedence.  Similarly, if 'TEST-WRAPPER env -i' will not work to run a\nprogram with an environment completely empty of variables except those\ndirectly assigned, then 'test-wrapper-env-only' must be set; its use has\nthe same syntax as 'test-wrapper-env', the only difference in its\nsemantics being starting with an empty set of environment variables\nrather than the ambient set.\n\nInstalling the C Library\n========================\n\nTo install the library and its header files, and the Info files of the\nmanual, type 'make install'.  This will build things, if necessary,\nbefore installing them; however, you should still compile everything\nfirst.  If you are installing the GNU C Library as your primary C\nlibrary, we recommend that you shut the system down to single-user mode\nfirst, and reboot afterward.  This minimizes the risk of breaking things\nwhen the library changes out from underneath.\n\n   'make install' will do the entire job of upgrading from a previous\ninstallation of the GNU C Library version 2.x.  There may sometimes be\nheaders left behind from the previous installation, but those are\ngenerally harmless.  If you want to avoid leaving headers behind you can\ndo things in the following order.\n\n   You must first build the library ('make'), optionally check it ('make\ncheck'), switch the include directories and then install ('make\ninstall').  The steps must be done in this order.  Not moving the\ndirectory before install will result in an unusable mixture of header\nfiles from both libraries, but configuring, building, and checking the\nlibrary requires the ability to compile and run programs against the old\nlibrary.  The new '/usr/include', after switching the include\ndirectories and before installing the library should contain the Linux\nheaders, but nothing else.  If you do this, you will need to restore any\nheaders from libraries other than the GNU C Library yourself after\ninstalling the library.\n\n   You can install the GNU C Library somewhere other than where you\nconfigured it to go by setting the 'DESTDIR' GNU standard make variable\non the command line for 'make install'.  The value of this variable is\nprepended to all the paths for installation.  This is useful when\nsetting up a chroot environment or preparing a binary distribution.  The\ndirectory should be specified with an absolute file name.  Installing\nwith the 'prefix' and 'exec_prefix' GNU standard make variables set is\nnot supported.\n\n   The GNU C Library includes a daemon called 'nscd', which you may or\nmay not want to run.  'nscd' caches name service lookups; it can\ndramatically improve performance with NIS+, and may help with DNS as\nwell.\n\n   One auxiliary program, '/usr/libexec/pt_chown', is installed setuid\n'root' if the '--enable-pt_chown' configuration option is used.  This\nprogram is invoked by the 'grantpt' function; it sets the permissions on\na pseudoterminal so it can be used by the calling process.  If you are\nusing a Linux kernel with the 'devpts' filesystem enabled and mounted at\n'/dev/pts', you don't need this program.\n\n   After installation you should configure the timezone and install\nlocales for your system.  The time zone configuration ensures that your\nsystem time matches the time for your current timezone.  The locales\nensure that the display of information on your system matches the\nexpectations of your language and geographic region.\n\n   The GNU C Library is able to use two kinds of localization\ninformation sources, the first is a locale database named\n'locale-archive' which is generally installed as\n'/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive'.  The locale archive has the benefit of\ntaking up less space and being very fast to load, but only if you plan\nto install sixty or more locales.  If you plan to install one or two\nlocales you can instead install individual locales into their self-named\ndirectories e.g. '/usr/lib/locale/en_US.utf8'.  For example to install\nthe German locale using the character set for UTF-8 with name 'de_DE'\ninto the locale archive issue the command 'localedef -i de_DE -f UTF-8\nde_DE', and to install just the one locale issue the command 'localedef\n--no-archive -i de_DE -f UTF-8 de_DE'.  To configure all locales that\nare supported by the GNU C Library, you can issue from your build\ndirectory the command 'make localedata/install-locales' to install all\nlocales into the locale archive or 'make\nlocaledata/install-locale-files' to install all locales as files in the\ndefault configured locale installation directory (derived from\n'--prefix' or '--localedir').  To install into an alternative system\nroot use 'DESTDIR' e.g. 'make localedata/install-locale-files\nDESTDIR=/opt/glibc', but note that this does not change the configured\nprefix.\n\n   To configure the locally used timezone, set the 'TZ' environment\nvariable.  The script 'tzselect' helps you to select the right value.\nAs an example, for Germany, 'tzselect' would tell you to use\n'TZ='Europe/Berlin''.  For a system wide installation (the given paths\nare for an installation with '--prefix=/usr'), link the timezone file\nwhich is in '/usr/share/zoneinfo' to the file '/etc/localtime'.  For\nGermany, you might execute 'ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin\n/etc/localtime'.\n\nRecommended Tools for Compilation\n=================================\n\nWe recommend installing the following GNU tools before attempting to\nbuild the GNU C Library:\n\n   * GNU 'make' 4.0 or newer\n\n     As of relase time, GNU 'make' 4.2.1 is the newest verified to work\n     to build the GNU C Library.\n\n   * GCC 4.9 or newer\n\n     GCC 4.9 or higher is required.  In general it is recommended to use\n     the newest version of the compiler that is known to work for\n     building the GNU C Library, as newer compilers usually produce\n     better code.  As of release time, GCC 8.1.1 is the newest compiler\n     verified to work to build the GNU C Library.\n\n     For PowerPC 64-bits little-endian (powerpc64le), GCC 6.2 or higher\n     is required.  This compiler version is the first to provide the\n     features required for building the GNU C Library with support for\n     '_Float128'.\n\n     For multi-arch support it is recommended to use a GCC which has\n     been built with support for GNU indirect functions.  This ensures\n     that correct debugging information is generated for functions\n     selected by IFUNC resolvers.  This support can either be enabled by\n     configuring GCC with '--enable-gnu-indirect-function', or by\n     enabling it by default by setting 'default_gnu_indirect_function'\n     variable for a particular architecture in the GCC source file\n     'gcc/config.gcc'.\n\n     You can use whatever compiler you like to compile programs that use\n     the GNU C Library.\n\n     Check the FAQ for any special compiler issues on particular\n     platforms.\n\n   * GNU 'binutils' 2.25 or later\n\n     You must use GNU 'binutils' (as and ld) to build the GNU C Library.\n     No other assembler or linker has the necessary functionality at the\n     moment.  As of release time, GNU 'binutils' 2.31.1 is the newest\n     verified to work to build the GNU C Library.\n\n   * GNU 'texinfo' 4.7 or later\n\n     To correctly translate and install the Texinfo documentation you\n     need this version of the 'texinfo' package.  Earlier versions do\n     not understand all the tags used in the document, and the\n     installation mechanism for the info files is not present or works\n     differently.  As of release time, 'texinfo' 6.5 is the newest\n     verified to work to build the GNU C Library.\n\n   * GNU 'awk' 3.1.2, or higher\n\n     'awk' is used in several places to generate files.  Some 'gawk'\n     extensions are used, including the 'asorti' function, which was\n     introduced in version 3.1.2 of 'gawk'.  As of release time, 'gawk'\n     version 4.2.1 is the newest verified to work to build the GNU C\n     Library.\n\n   * GNU 'bison' 2.7 or later\n\n     'bison' is used to generate the 'yacc' parser code in the 'intl'\n     subdirectory.  As of release time, 'bison' version 3.0.4 is the\n     newest verified to work to build the GNU C Library.\n\n   * Perl 5\n\n     Perl is not required, but if present it is used in some tests and\n     the 'mtrace' program, to build the GNU C Library manual, as well as\n     to regenerate 'locale/C-translit.h' if its source files are\n     modified.  As of release time 'perl' version 5.28.0 is the newest\n     verified to work to build the GNU C Library.\n\n   * GNU 'sed' 3.02 or newer\n\n     'Sed' is used in several places to generate files.  Most scripts\n     work with any version of 'sed'.  As of release time, 'sed' version\n     4.5 is the newest verified to work to build the GNU C Library.\n\n   * Python 2.7/3.4 or later\n\n     Python is required to run some tests.  As of release time, Python\n     3.6 is the newest verified to work for testing the GNU C Library.\n\n   * PExpect 4.0\n\n     The pretty printer tests drive GDB through test programs and\n     compare its output to the printers'.  PExpect is used to capture\n     the output of GDB, and should be compatible with the Python version\n     in your system.  As of release time PExpect 4.3 is the newest\n     verified to work to test the pretty printers.\n\n   * GDB 7.8 or later with support for Python 2.7/3.4 or later\n\n     GDB itself needs to be configured with Python support in order to\n     use the pretty printers.  Notice that your system having Python\n     available doesn't imply that GDB supports it, nor that your\n     system's Python and GDB's have the same version.  As of release\n     time GNU 'debugger' 8.0.1 is the newest verified to work to test\n     the pretty printers.\n\n     Unless Python, PExpect and GDB with Python support are present, the\n     printer tests will report themselves as 'UNSUPPORTED'.  Notice that\n     some of the printer tests require the GNU C Library to be compiled\n     with debugging symbols.\n\nIf you change any of the 'configure.ac' files you will also need\n\n   * GNU 'autoconf' 2.69 (exactly)\n\nand if you change any of the message translation files you will need\n\n   * GNU 'gettext' 0.10.36 or later\n\n     As of release time, GNU 'gettext' version 0.19.8.1 is the newest\n     version verified to work to build the GNU C Library.\n\nYou may also need these packages if you upgrade your source tree using\npatches, although we try to avoid this.\n\nSpecific advice for GNU/Linux systems\n=====================================\n\nIf you are installing the GNU C Library on GNU/Linux systems, you need\nto have the header files from a 3.2 or newer kernel around for\nreference.  (For the ia64 architecture, you need version 3.2.18 or newer\nbecause this is the first version with support for the 'accept4' system\ncall.)  These headers must be installed using 'make headers_install';\nthe headers present in the kernel source directory are not suitable for\ndirect use by the GNU C Library.  You do not need to use that kernel,\njust have its headers installed where the GNU C Library can access them,\nreferred to here as INSTALL-DIRECTORY.  The easiest way to do this is to\nunpack it in a directory such as '/usr/src/linux-VERSION'.  In that\ndirectory, run 'make headers_install\nINSTALL_HDR_PATH=INSTALL-DIRECTORY'.  Finally, configure the GNU C\nLibrary with the option '--with-headers=INSTALL-DIRECTORY/include'.  Use\nthe most recent kernel you can get your hands on.  (If you are\ncross-compiling the GNU C Library, you need to specify\n'ARCH=ARCHITECTURE' in the 'make headers_install' command, where\nARCHITECTURE is the architecture name used by the Linux kernel, such as\n'x86' or 'powerpc'.)\n\n   After installing the GNU C Library, you may need to remove or rename\ndirectories such as '/usr/include/linux' and '/usr/include/asm', and\nreplace them with copies of directories such as 'linux' and 'asm' from\n'INSTALL-DIRECTORY/include'.  All directories present in\n'INSTALL-DIRECTORY/include' should be copied, except that the GNU C\nLibrary provides its own version of '/usr/include/scsi'; the files\nprovided by the kernel should be copied without replacing those provided\nby the GNU C Library.  The 'linux', 'asm' and 'asm-generic' directories\nare required to compile programs using the GNU C Library; the other\ndirectories describe interfaces to the kernel but are not required if\nnot compiling programs using those interfaces.  You do not need to copy\nkernel headers if you did not specify an alternate kernel header source\nusing '--with-headers'.\n\n   The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for GNU/Linux systems expects some\ncomponents of the GNU C Library installation to be in '/lib' and some in\n'/usr/lib'.  This is handled automatically if you configure the GNU C\nLibrary with '--prefix=/usr'.  If you set some other prefix or allow it\nto default to '/usr/local', then all the components are installed there.\n\nReporting Bugs\n==============\n\nThere are probably bugs in the GNU C Library.  There are certainly\nerrors and omissions in this manual.  If you report them, they will get\nfixed.  If you don't, no one will ever know about them and they will\nremain unfixed for all eternity, if not longer.\n\n   It is a good idea to verify that the problem has not already been\nreported.  Bugs are documented in two places: The file 'BUGS' describes\na number of well known bugs and the central GNU C Library bug tracking\nsystem has a WWW interface at <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/>.  The\nWWW interface gives you access to open and closed reports.  A closed\nreport normally includes a patch or a hint on solving the problem.\n\n   To report a bug, first you must find it.  With any luck, this will be\nthe hard part.  Once you've found a bug, make sure it's really a bug.  A\ngood way to do this is to see if the GNU C Library behaves the same way\nsome other C library does.  If so, probably you are wrong and the\nlibraries are right (but not necessarily).  If not, one of the libraries\nis probably wrong.  It might not be the GNU C Library.  Many historical\nUnix C libraries permit things that we don't, such as closing a file\ntwice.\n\n   If you think you have found some way in which the GNU C Library does\nnot conform to the ISO and POSIX standards (*note Standards and\nPortability::), that is definitely a bug.  Report it!\n\n   Once you're sure you've found a bug, try to narrow it down to the\nsmallest test case that reproduces the problem.  In the case of a C\nlibrary, you really only need to narrow it down to one library function\ncall, if possible.  This should not be too difficult.\n\n   The final step when you have a simple test case is to report the bug.\nDo this at <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/bugs.html>.\n\n   If you are not sure how a function should behave, and this manual\ndoesn't tell you, that's a bug in the manual.  Report that too!  If the\nfunction's behavior disagrees with the manual, then either the library\nor the manual has a bug, so report the disagreement.  If you find any\nerrors or omissions in this manual, please report them to the bug\ndatabase.  If you refer to specific sections of the manual, please\ninclude the section names for easier identification.\n"

The new\n  target is run by issuing the following command in your build tree:\n  'make localedata/install-locale-files', with an optional DESTDIR\n  to set the install root if you wish to install into a non-default\n  configured location.\n\n* Optimized generic sinf, cosf, sincosf and tanf.\n\nDeprecated and removed features, and other changes affecting compatibility:\n\n* The glibc.tune tunable namespace has been renamed to glibc.cpu and the\n  tunable glibc.tune.cpu has been renamed to glibc.cpu.name.\n\nChanges to build and runtime requirements:\n\n  [Add changes to build and runtime requirements here]\n\nSecurity related changes:\n\n  [Add security related changes here]\n\nThe following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  [The release manager will add the list generated by\n  scripts/list-fixed-bugs.py just before the release.]\n\n\f\nVersion 2.28\n\nMajor new features:\n\n* The localization data for ISO 14651 is updated to match the 2016\n  Edition 4 release of the standard, this matches data provided by\n  Unicode 9.0.0.  This update introduces significant improvements to the\n  collation of Unicode characters.  This release deviates slightly from\n  the standard in that the collation element ordering for lowercase and\n  uppercase LATIN script characters is adjusted to ensure that regular\n  expressions with ranges like [a-z] and [A-Z] don't interleave e.g. A\n  is not matched by [a-z].  With the update many locales have been\n  updated to take advantage of the new collation information.  The new\n  collation information has increased the size of the compiled locale\n  archive or binary locales.\n\n* The GNU C Library can now be compiled with support for Intel CET, AKA\n  Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology.  When the library is built\n  with --enable-cet, the resulting glibc is protected with indirect\n  branch tracking (IBT) and shadow stack (SHSTK).  CET-enabled glibc is\n  compatible with all existing executables and shared libraries.  This\n  feature is currently supported on i386, x86_64 and x32 with GCC 8 and\n  binutils 2.29 or later.  Note that CET-enabled glibc requires CPUs\n  capable of multi-byte NOPs, like x86-64 processors as well as Intel\n  Pentium Pro or newer.  NOTE: --enable-cet has been tested for i686,\n  x86_64 and x32 on non-CET processors.  --enable-cet has been tested\n  for x86_64 and x32 on CET SDVs, but Intel CET support hasn't been\n  validated for i686.\n\n* The GNU C Library now has correct support for ABSOLUTE symbols\n  (SHN_ABS-relative symbols).  Previously such ABSOLUTE symbols were\n  relocated incorrectly or in some cases discarded.  The GNU linker can\n  make use of the newer semantics, but it must communicate it to the\n  dynamic loader by setting the ELF file's identification (EI_ABIVERSION\n  field) to indicate such support is required.\n\n* Unicode 11.0.0 Support: Character encoding, character type info, and\n  transliteration tables are all updated to Unicode 11.0.0, using\n  generator scripts contributed by Mike FABIAN (Red Hat).\n\n* <math.h> functions that round their results to a narrower type are added\n  from TS 18661-1:2014 and TS 18661-3:2015:\n\n  - fadd, faddl, daddl and corresponding fMaddfN, fMaddfNx, fMxaddfN and\n    fMxaddfNx functions.\n\n  - fsub, fsubl, dsubl and corresponding fMsubfN, fMsubfNx, fMxsubfN and\n    fMxsubfNx functions.\n\n  - fmul, fmull, dmull and corresponding fMmulfN, fMmulfNx, fMxmulfN and\n    fMxmulfNx functions.\n\n  - fdiv, fdivl, ddivl and corresponding fMdivfN, fMdivfNx, fMxdivfN and\n    fMxdivfNx functions.\n\n* Two grammatical forms of month names are now supported for the following\n  languages: Armenian, Asturian, Catalan, Czech, Kashubian, Occitan, Ossetian,\n  Scottish Gaelic, Upper Sorbian, and Walloon.  The following languages now\n  support two grammatical forms in abbreviated month names: Catalan, Greek,\n  and Kashubian.\n\n* Newly added locales: Lower Sorbian (dsb_DE) and Yakut (sah_RU) also\n  include the support for two grammatical forms of month names.\n\n* Building and running on GNU/Hurd systems now works without out-of-tree\n  patches.\n\n* The renameat2 function has been added, a variant of the renameat function\n  which has a flags argument.  If the flags are zero, the renameat2 function\n  acts like renameat.  If the flag is not zero and there is no kernel\n  support for renameat2, the function will fail with an errno value of\n  EINVAL.  This is different from the existing gnulib function renameatu,\n  which performs a plain rename operation in case of a RENAME_NOREPLACE\n  flags and a non-existing destination (and therefore has a race condition\n  that can clobber the destination inadvertently).\n\n* The statx function has been added, a variant of the fstatat64\n  function with an additional flags argument.  If there is no direct\n  kernel support for statx, glibc provides basic stat support based on\n  the fstatat64 function.\n\n* IDN domain names in getaddrinfo and getnameinfo now use the system libidn2\n  library if installed.  libidn2 version 2.0.5 or later is recommended.  If\n  libidn2 is not available, internationalized domain names are not encoded\n  or decoded even if the AI_IDN or NI_IDN flags are passed to getaddrinfo or\n  getnameinfo.  (getaddrinfo calls with non-ASCII names and AI_IDN will fail\n  with an encoding error.)  Flags which used to change the IDN encoding and\n  decoding behavior (AI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED, AI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES,\n  NI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED, NI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES) have been\n  deprecated.  They no longer have any effect.\n\n* Parsing of dynamic string tokens in DT_RPATH, DT_RUNPATH, DT_NEEDED,\n  DT_AUXILIARY, and DT_FILTER has been expanded to support the full\n  range of ELF gABI expressions including such constructs as\n  '$ORIGIN$ORIGIN' (if valid).  For SUID/GUID applications the rules\n  have been further restricted, and where in the past a dynamic string\n  token sequence may have been interpreted as a literal string it will\n  now cause a load failure.  These load failures were always considered\n  unspecified behaviour from the perspective of the dynamic loader, and\n  for safety are now load errors e.g. /foo/${ORIGIN}.so in DT_NEEDED\n  results in a load failure now.\n\n* Support for ISO C threads (ISO/IEC 9899:2011) has been added.  The\n  implementation includes all the standard functions provided by\n  <threads.h>:\n\n  - thrd_current, thrd_equal, thrd_sleep, thrd_yield, thrd_create,\n    thrd_detach, thrd_exit, and thrd_join for thread management.\n\n  - mtx_init, mtx_lock, mtx_timedlock, mtx_trylock, mtx_unlock, and\n    mtx_destroy for mutual exclusion.\n\n  - call_once for function call synchronization.\n\n  - cnd_broadcast, cnd_destroy, cnd_init, cnd_signal, cnd_timedwait, and\n    cnd_wait for conditional variables.\n\n  - tss_create, tss_delete, tss_get, and tss_set for thread-local storage.\n\n  Application developers must link against libpthread to use ISO C threads.\n\nDeprecated and removed features, and other changes affecting compatibility:\n\n* The nonstandard header files <libio.h> and <_G_config.h> are no longer\n  installed.  Software that was using either header should be updated to\n  use standard <stdio.h> interfaces instead.\n\n* The stdio functions 'getc' and 'putc' are no longer defined as macros.\n  This was never required by the C standard, and the macros just expanded\n  to call alternative names for the same functions.  If you hoped getc and\n  putc would provide performance improvements over fgetc and fputc, instead\n  investigate using (f)getc_unlocked and (f)putc_unlocked, and, if\n  necessary, flockfile and funlockfile.\n\n* All stdio functions now treat end-of-file as a sticky condition.  If you\n  read from a file until EOF, and then the file is enlarged by another\n  process, you must call clearerr or another function with the same effect\n  (e.g. fseek, rewind) before you can read the additional data.  This\n  corrects a longstanding C99 conformance bug.  It is most likely to affect\n  programs that use stdio to read interactive input from a terminal.\n  (Bug #1190.)\n\n* The macros 'major', 'minor', and 'makedev' are now only available from\n  the header <sys/sysmacros.h>; not from <sys/types.h> or various other\n  headers that happen to include <sys/types.h>.  These macros are rarely\n  used, not part of POSIX nor XSI, and their names frequently collide with\n  user code; see https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19239 for\n  further explanation.\n\n  <sys/sysmacros.h> is a GNU extension.  Portable programs that require\n  these macros should first include <sys/types.h>, and then include\n  <sys/sysmacros.h> if __GNU_LIBRARY__ is defined.\n\n* The tilegx*-*-linux-gnu configurations are no longer supported.\n\n* The obsolete function ustat is no longer available to newly linked\n  binaries; the headers <ustat.h> and <sys/ustat.h> have been removed.  This\n  function has been deprecated in favor of fstatfs and statfs.\n\n* The obsolete function nfsservctl is no longer available to newly linked\n  binaries.  This function was specific to systems using the Linux kernel\n  and could not usefully be used with the GNU C Library on systems with\n  version 3.1 or later of the Linux kernel.\n\n* The obsolete function name llseek is no longer available to newly linked\n  binaries.  This function was specific to systems using the Linux kernel\n  and was not declared in a header.  Programs should use the lseek64 name\n  for this function instead.\n\n* The AI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED and NI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED flags for the\n  getaddrinfo and getnameinfo functions have been deprecated.  The behavior\n  previously selected by them is now always enabled.\n\n* The AI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES and NI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES flags for\n  the getaddrinfo and getnameinfo functions have been deprecated.  The STD3\n  restriction (rejecting '_' in host names, among other things) has been\n  removed, for increased compatibility with non-IDN name resolution.\n\n* The fcntl function now have a Long File Support variant named fcntl64.  It\n  is added to fix some Linux Open File Description (OFD) locks usage on non\n  LFS mode.  As for others *64 functions, fcntl64 semantics are analogous with\n  fcntl and LFS support is handled transparently.  Also for Linux, the OFD\n  locks act as a cancellation entrypoint.\n\n* The obsolete functions encrypt, encrypt_r, setkey, setkey_r, cbc_crypt,\n  ecb_crypt, and des_setparity are no longer available to newly linked\n  binaries, and the headers <rpc/des_crypt.h> and <rpc/rpc_des.h> are no\n  longer installed.  These functions encrypted and decrypted data with the\n  DES block cipher, which is no longer considered secure.  Software that\n  still uses these functions should switch to a modern cryptography library,\n  such as libgcrypt.\n\n* Reflecting the removal of the encrypt and setkey functions above, the\n  macro _XOPEN_CRYPT is no longer defined.  As a consequence, the crypt\n  function is no longer declared unless _DEFAULT_SOURCE or _GNU_SOURCE is\n  enabled.\n\n* The obsolete function fcrypt is no longer available to newly linked\n  binaries.  It was just another name for the standard function crypt,\n  and it has not appeared in any header file in many years.\n\n* We have tentative plans to hand off maintenance of the passphrase-hashing\n  library, libcrypt, to a separate development project that will, we hope,\n  keep up better with new passphrase-hashing algorithms.  We will continue\n  to declare 'crypt' in <unistd.h>, and programs that use 'crypt' or\n  'crypt_r' should not need to change at all; however, distributions will\n  need to install <crypt.h> and libcrypt from a separate project.\n\n  In this release, if the configure option --disable-crypt is used, glibc\n  will not install <crypt.h> or libcrypt, making room for the separate\n  project's versions of these files.  The plan is to make this the default\n  behavior in a future release.\n\nChanges to build and runtime requirements:\n\n  GNU make 4.0 or later is now required to build glibc.\n\nSecurity related changes:\n\n  CVE-2016-6261, CVE-2016-6263, CVE-2017-14062: Various vulnerabilities have\n  been fixed by removing the glibc-internal IDNA implementation and using\n  the system-provided libidn2 library instead.

new features:\n\n* The GNU C Library can now be compiled with support for building static\n  PIE executables (See --enable-static-pie in INSTALL).  These static PIE\n  executables are like static executables but can be loaded at any address\n  and provide additional security hardening benefits at the cost of some\n  memory and performance.  When the library is built with --enable-static-pie\n  the resulting libc.a is usable with GCC 8 and above to create static PIE\n  executables using the GCC option '-static-pie'.  This feature is currently\n  supported on i386, x86_64 and x32 with binutils 2.29 or later, and on\n  aarch64 with binutils 2.30 or later.\n\n* Optimized x86-64 asin, atan2, exp, expf, log, pow, atan, sin, cosf,\n  sinf, sincosf and tan with FMA, contributed by Arjan van de Ven and\n  H.J. Lu from Intel.\n\n* Optimized x86-64 trunc and truncf for processors with SSE4.1.\n\n* Optimized generic expf, exp2f, logf, log2f, powf, sinf, cosf and sincosf.\n\n* In order to support faster and safer process termination the malloc API\n  family of functions will no longer print a failure address and stack\n  backtrace after detecting heap corruption.  The goal is to minimize the\n  amount of work done after corruption is detected and to avoid potential\n  security issues in continued process execution.  Reducing shutdown time\n  leads to lower overall process restart latency, so there is benefit both\n  from a security and performance perspective.\n\n* The abort function terminates the process immediately, without flushing\n  stdio streams.  Previous glibc versions used to flush streams, resulting\n  in deadlocks and further data corruption.  This change also affects\n  process aborts as the result of assertion failures.\n\n* On platforms where long double has the IEEE binary128 format (aarch64,\n  alpha, mips64, riscv, s390 and sparc), the math library now implements\n  _Float128 interfaces for that type, as defined by ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015.\n  These are the same interfaces added in version 2.26 for some platforms where\n  this format is supported but is not the format of long double.\n\n* On platforms with support for _Float64x (aarch64, alpha, i386, ia64,\n  mips64, powerpc64le, riscv, s390, sparc and x86_64), the math library now\n  implements interfaces for that type, as defined by ISO/IEC TS\n  18661-3:2015.  These are corresponding interfaces to those supported for\n  _Float128.\n\n* The math library now implements interfaces for the _Float32, _Float64 and\n  _Float32x types, as defined by ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015.  These are\n  corresponding interfaces to those supported for _Float128.\n\n* glibc now implements the memfd_create and mlock2 functions on Linux.\n\n* Support for memory protection keys was added.  The <sys/mman.h> header now\n  declares the functions pkey_alloc, pkey_free, pkey_mprotect, pkey_set,\n  pkey_get.\n\n* The copy_file_range function was added.\n\n* Optimized memcpy, mempcpy, memmove, and memset for sparc M7.\n\n* The ldconfig utility now processes `include' directives using the C/POSIX\n  collation ordering.  Previous glibc versions used locale-specific\n  ordering, the change might break systems that relied on that.\n\n* Support for two grammatical forms of month names has been added.\n  In a call to strftime, the \"%B\" and \"%b\" format specifiers will now\n  produce the grammatical form required when the month is used as part\n  of a complete date.  New \"%OB\" and \"%Ob\" specifiers produce the form\n  required when the month is named by itself.  For instance, in Greek\n  and in many Slavic and Baltic languages, \"%B\" will produce the month\n  in genitive case, and \"%OB\" will produce the month in nominative case.\n\n  In a call to strptime, \"%B\", \"%b\", \"%h\", \"%OB\", \"%Ob\", and \"%Oh\"\n  are all valid and will all accept any known form of month\n  name---standalone or complete, abbreviated or full.  In a call to\n  nl_langinfo, the query constants MON_1..12 and ABMON_1..12 return\n  the strings used by \"%B\" and \"%b\", respectively.  New query\n  constants ALTMON_1..12 and _NL_ABALTMON_1..12 return the strings\n  used by \"%OB\" and \"%Ob\", respectively.\n\n  In a locale definition file, use \"alt_mon\" and \"ab_alt_mon\" to\n  define the strings for %OB and %Ob, respectively; these have the\n  same syntax as \"mon\" and \"abmon\".  These arrays are optional; if they\n  are not provided then they have the same content as \"mon\" and \"abmon\",\n  respectively.\n\n  These features are provided for locales which define \"alt_mon\" and/or\n  \"ab_alt_mon\" in their locale source data.  This release includes such\n  alternative month name data for the following languages: Belarusian,\n  Croatian, Greek, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian.\n\n  This feature is currently a GNU extension, but it is expected to\n  be added to the next revision of POSIX, and it is also already\n  available on some BSD-derived operating systems.\n\n  This feature will cause existing statically compiled applications\n  to fail to load locales and fall back to the builtin C/POSIX locales.\n  See notes below for other changes affecting compatibility.\n\n* Support for the RISC-V ISA running on Linux has been added.  This port\n  requires at least binutils-2.30, gcc-7.3.0, and linux-4.15; and is supported\n  for the following ISA and ABI pairs:\n\n    - rv64imac lp64\n    - rv64imafdc lp64\n    - rv64imafdc lp64d\n\nDeprecated and removed features, and other changes affecting compatibility:\n\n* Statically compiled applications attempting to load locales compiled for the\n  GNU C Library version 2.27 will fail and fall back to the builtin C/POSIX\n  locale.  The reason for this is that the addition of the new \"%OB\" and \"%Ob\",\n  support for two grammatical forms of the month names, also extends the locale\n  data binary format.  Static applications needing locale support must be\n  recompiled to match the runtime and data they are deployed with. In some\n  distributions there is an upgrade window where dynamically linked applications\n  may use a new library but the old locale data and also fall back to the\n  builtin C/POSIX locales; restarting the application process is sufficient to\n  fix this.\n\n* Support for statically linked applications which call dlopen is deprecated\n  and will be removed in a future version of glibc.  Applications which call\n  dlopen need to be linked dynamically instead.\n\n* Support for old programs which use internal stdio data structures and\n  functions is deprecated.  This includes programs which use the C++ streams\n  provided by libstdc++ in GCC 2.95.  Programs which use the internal\n  symbols _IO_adjust_wcolumn, _IO_default_doallocate, _IO_default_finish,\n  _IO_default_pbackfail, _IO_default_uflow, _IO_default_xsgetn,\n  _IO_default_xsputn, _IO_doallocbuf, _IO_do_write, _IO_file_attach,\n  _IO_file_close, _IO_file_close_it, _IO_file_doallocate, _IO_file_fopen,\n  _IO_file_init, _IO_file_jumps, _IO_fileno, _IO_file_open,\n  _IO_file_overflow, _IO_file_read, _IO_file_seek, _IO_file_seekoff,\n  _IO_file_setbuf, _IO_file_stat, _IO_file_sync, _IO_file_underflow,\n  _IO_file_write, _IO_file_xsputn, _IO_flockfile, _IO_flush_all,\n  _IO_flush_all_linebuffered, _IO_free_backup_area, _IO_free_wbackup_area,\n  _IO_init, _IO_init_marker, _IO_init_wmarker, _IO_iter_begin, _IO_iter_end,\n  _IO_iter_file, _IO_iter_next, _IO_least_wmarker, _IO_link_in,\n  _IO_list_all, _IO_list_lock, _IO_list_resetlock, _IO_list_unlock,\n  _IO_marker_delta, _IO_marker_difference, _IO_remove_marker, _IO_seekmark,\n  _IO_seekwmark, _IO_str_init_readonly, _IO_str_init_static,\n  _IO_str_overflow, _IO_str_pbackfail, _IO_str_seekoff, _IO_str_underflow,\n  _IO_switch_to_main_wget_area, _IO_switch_to_wget_mode,\n  _IO_unsave_wmarkers, _IO_wdefault_doallocate, _IO_wdefault_finish,\n  _IO_wdefault_pbackfail, _IO_wdefault_setbuf, _IO_wdefault_uflow,\n  _IO_wdefault_xsgetn, _IO_wdefault_xsputn, _IO_wdoallocbuf, _IO_wdo_write,\n  _IO_wfile_jumps, _IO_wfile_overflow, _IO_wfile_sync, _IO_wfile_underflow,\n  _IO_wfile_xsputn, _IO_wmarker_delta, or _IO_wsetb may stop working with a\n  future version of glibc.  Unlike other symbol removals, these old\n  applications will not be supported using compatibility symbols.\n\n* On GNU/Linux, the obsolete Linux constant PTRACE_SEIZE_DEVEL is no longer\n  defined by <sys/ptrace.h>.\n\n* libm no longer supports SVID error handling (calling a user-provided\n  matherr function on error) or the _LIB_VERSION variable to control error\n  handling.  (SVID error handling and the _LIB_VERSION variable still work\n  for binaries linked against older versions of the GNU C Library.)  The\n  libieee.a library is no longer provided.  math.h no longer defines struct\n  exception, or the macros X_TLOSS, DOMAIN, SING, OVERFLOW, UNDERFLOW,\n  TLOSS, PLOSS and HUGE.\n\n* The libm functions pow10, pow10f and pow10l are no longer supported for\n  new programs.  Programs should use the standard names exp10, exp10f and\n  exp10l for these functions instead.\n\n* The mcontext_t type is no longer the same as struct sigcontext.  On\n  platforms where it was previously the same, this changes the C++ name\n  mangling for interfaces involving this type.\n\n* The add-ons mechanism for building additional packages at the same time as\n  glibc has been removed.  The --enable-add-ons configure option is now\n  ignored.\n\n* The --without-fp configure option is now ignored.  Whether hardware\n  floating-point instructions are used is now configured based on whether\n  the compiler used at configure time (without any options implied by a\n  --with-cpu= configure option) uses such instructions.\n\n* The res_hnok, res_dnok, res_mailok and res_ownok functions now check that\n  the specified string can be parsed as a domain name.\n\n* In the malloc_info output, the <heap> element may contain another <aspace>\n  element, \"subheaps\", which contains the number of sub-heaps.\n\n* The libresolv function p_secstodate is no longer supported for new\n  programs.\n\n* The tilepro-*-linux-gnu configuration is no longer supported.\n\n* The nonstandard header files <libio.h> and <_G_config.h> are deprecated\n  and will be removed in a future release.  Software that is still using\n  either header should be updated to use standard <stdio.h> interfaces\n  instead.\n\n  libio.h was originally the header for a set of supported GNU extensions,\n  but they have not been maintained as such in many years, they are now\n  standing in the way of improvements to stdio, and we don't think there are\n  any remaining external users.  _G_config.h was never intended for public\n  use, but predates the bits convention.\n\nChanges to build and runtime requirements:\n\n* bison version 2.7 or later is required to generate code in the 'intl'\n  subdirectory.\n\nSecurity related changes:\n\n  CVE-2009-5064: The ldd script would sometimes run the program under\n  examination directly, without preventing code execution through the\n  dynamic linker.  (The glibc project disputes that this is a security\n  vulnerability; only trusted binaries must be examined using the ldd\n  script.)\n\n  CVE-2017-15670: The glob function, when invoked with GLOB_TILDE,\n  suffered from a one-byte overflow during ~ operator processing (either\n  on the stack or the heap, depending on the length of the user name).\n  Reported by Tim Rühsen.\n\n  CVE-2017-15671: The glob function, when invoked with GLOB_TILDE,\n  would sometimes fail to free memory allocated during ~ operator\n  processing, leading to a memory leak and, potentially, to a denial\n  of service.\n\n  CVE-2017-15804: The glob function, when invoked with GLOB_TILDE and\n  without GLOB_NOESCAPE, could write past the end of a buffer while\n  unescaping user names.  Reported by Tim Rühsen.\n\n  CVE-2017-17426: The malloc function, when called with an object size near\n  the value SIZE_MAX, would return a pointer to a buffer which is too small,\n  instead of NULL.  This was a regression introduced with the new malloc\n  thread cache in glibc 2.26.  Reported by Iain Buclaw.\n\n  CVE-2017-1000408: Incorrect array size computation in _dl_init_paths leads\n  to the allocation of too much memory.  (This is not a security bug per se,\n  it is mentioned here only because of the CVE assignment.)  Reported by\n  Qualys.\n\n  CVE-2017-1000409: Buffer overflow in _dl_init_paths due to miscomputation\n  of the number of search path components.  (This is not a security\n  vulnerability per se because no trust boundary is crossed if the fix for\n  CVE-2017-1000366 has been applied, but it is mentioned here only because\n  of the CVE assignment.)  Reported by Qualys.\n\n  CVE-2017-16997: Incorrect handling of RPATH or RUNPATH containing $ORIGIN\n  for AT_SECURE or SUID binaries could be used to load libraries from the\n  current directory.\n\n  CVE-2018-1000001: Buffer underflow in realpath function when getcwd function\n  succeeds without returning an absolute path due to unexpected behaviour\n  of the Linux kernel getcwd syscall.  Reported by halfdog.\n\n  CVE-2018-6485: The posix_memalign and memalign functions, when called with\n  an object size near the value of SIZE_MAX, would return a pointer to a\n  buffer which is too small, instead of NULL.  Reported by Jakub Wilk.\n\n  CVE-2018-6551: The malloc function, when called with an object size near\n  the value of SIZE_MAX, would return a pointer to a buffer which is too\n  small, instead of NULL.\n\nThe following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  [866] glob: glob should match dangling symlinks\n  [1062] glob: sysdeps/generic/glob.c merge from gnulib (part 3 of 3)\n  [2522]

per-thread cache has been added to malloc. Access to the cache requires\n  no locks and therefore significantly accelerates the fast path to allocate\n  and free small amounts of memory. Refilling an empty cache requires locking\n  the underlying arena. Performance measurements show significant gains in a\n  wide variety of user workloads. Workloads were captured using a special\n  instrumented malloc and analyzed with a malloc simulator. Contributed by\n  DJ Delorie with the help of Florian Weimer, and Carlos O'Donell.\n\n* Unicode 10.0.0 Support: Character encoding, character type info, and\n  transliteration tables are all updated to Unicode 10.0.0, using\n  generator scripts contributed by Mike FABIAN (Red Hat).\n  These updates cause user visible changes, especially the changes in\n  wcwidth for many emoji characters cause problems when emoji sequences\n  are rendered with pango, see for example:\n  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=780669#c5\n\n* Collation of Hungarian has been overhauled and is now consistent with \"The\n  Rules of Hungarian Orthography, 12th edition\" (Bug 18934).  Contributed by\n  Egmont Koblinger.\n\n* Improvements to the DNS stub resolver, contributed by Florian Weimer:\n\n  - The GNU C Library will now detect when /etc/resolv.conf has been\n    modified and reload the changed configuration.  The new resolver option\n    “no-reload” (RES_NORELOAD) disables this behavior.\n\n  - The GNU C Library now supports an arbitrary number of search domains\n    (configured using the “search” directive in /etc/resolv.conf);\n    previously, there was a hard limit of six domains.  For backward\n    compatibility, applications that directly modify the ‘_res’ global\n    object are still limited to six search domains.\n\n  - When the “rotate” (RES_ROTATE) resolver option is active, the GNU C\n    Library will now randomly pick a name server from the configuration as a\n    starting point.  (Previously, the second name server was always used.)\n\n* The tunables feature is now enabled by default.  This allows users to tweak\n  behavior of the GNU C Library using the GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable.\n\n* New function reallocarray, which resizes an allocated block (like realloc)\n  to the product of two sizes, with a guaranteed clean failure upon integer\n  overflow in the multiplication.  Originally from OpenBSD, contributed by\n  Dennis Wölfing and Rüdiger Sonderfeld.\n\n* New wrappers for the Linux-specific system calls preadv2 and pwritev2.\n  These are extended versions of preadv and pwritev, respectively, taking an\n  additional flags argument.  The set of supported flags depends on the\n  running kernel; full support currently requires kernel 4.7 or later.\n\n* posix_spawnattr_setflags now supports the flag POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID, to\n  create a new session ID for the spawned process.  This feature is\n  scheduled to be added to the next major revision of POSIX; for the time\n  being, it is available under _GNU_SOURCE.\n\n* errno.h is now safe to use from C-preprocessed assembly language on all\n  supported operating systems.  In this context, it will only define the\n  Exxxx constants, as preprocessor macros expanding to integer literals.\n\n* On ia64, powerpc64le, x86-32, and x86-64, the math library now implements\n  128-bit floating point as defined by ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 (IEEE\n  754-2008) and ISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015.  Contributed by Paul E. Murphy,\n  Gabriel F. T. Gomes, Tulio Magno Quites Machado Filho, and Joseph Myers.\n\n  To compile programs that use this feature, the compiler must support\n  128-bit floating point with the type name _Float128 (as defined by TS\n  18661-3) or __float128 (the nonstandard name used by GCC for C++, and for\n  C prior to version 7).  _GNU_SOURCE or __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__\n  must be defined to make the new interfaces visible.\n\n  The new functions and macros correspond to those present for other\n  floating-point types (except for a few obsolescent interfaces not\n  supported for the new type), with F128 or f128 suffixes; for example,\n  strtof128, HUGE_VAL_F128 and cosf128.  Following TS 18661-3, there are no\n  printf or scanf formats for the new type; the strfromf128 and strtof128\n  interfaces should be used instead.\n\nDeprecated and removed features, and other changes affecting compatibility:\n\n* The synchronization that pthread_spin_unlock performs has been changed to\n  now be equivalent to a C11 atomic store with release memory order to the\n  spin lock's memory location.  Previously, several (but not all)\n  architectures used stronger synchronization (e.g., containing what is\n  often called a full barrier).  This change can improve performance, but\n  may affect odd fringe uses of spin locks that depend on the previous\n  behavior (e.g., using spin locks as atomic variables to try to implement\n  Dekker's mutual exclusion algorithm).\n\n* The port to Native Client running on ARMv7-A (--host=arm-nacl) has been\n  removed.\n\n* Sun RPC is deprecated.  The rpcgen program, librpcsvc, and Sun RPC headers\n  will only be built and installed when the GNU C Library is configured with\n  --enable-obsolete-rpc.  This allows alternative RPC implementations, such\n  as TIRPC or rpcsvc-proto, to be used.\n\n* The NIS(+) name service modules, libnss_nis, libnss_nisplus, and\n  libnss_compat, are deprecated, and will not be built or installed by\n  default.\n\n  The NIS(+) support library, libnsl, is also deprecated.  By default, a\n  compatibility shared library will be built and installed, but not headers\n  or development libraries. Only a few NIS-related programs require this\n  library.  (In particular, the GNU C Library has never required programs\n  that use 'gethostbyname' to be linked with libnsl.)\n\n  Replacement implementations based on TIRPC, which additionally support\n  IPv6, are available from <https://github.com/thkukuk/>.  The configure\n  option --enable-obsolete-nsl will cause libnsl's headers, and the NIS(+)\n  name service modules, to be built and installed.\n\n* The DNS stub resolver no longer performs EDNS fallback.  If EDNS or DNSSEC\n  support is enabled, the configured recursive resolver must support EDNS.\n  (Responding to EDNS-enabled queries with responses which are not\n  EDNS-enabled is fine, but FORMERR responses are not.)\n\n* res_mkquery and res_nmkquery no longer support the IQUERY opcode.  DNS\n  servers have not supported this opcode for a long time.\n\n* The _res_opcodes variable has been removed from libresolv.  It had been\n  exported by accident.\n\n* <string.h> no longer includes inline versions of any string functions,\n  as this kind of optimization is better done by the compiler.  The macros\n  __USE_STRING_INLINES and __NO_STRING_INLINES no longer have any effect.\n\n* The nonstandard header <xlocale.h> has been removed.  Most programs should\n  use <locale.h> instead.  If you have a specific need for the definition of\n  locale_t with no other declarations, please contact\n  libc-alpha@sourceware.org and explain.\n\n* The obsolete header <sys/ultrasound.h> has been removed.\n\n* The obsolete signal constant SIGUNUSED is no longer defined by <signal.h>.\n\n* The obsolete function cfree has been removed.  Applications should use\n  free instead.\n\n* The stack_t type no longer has the name struct sigaltstack.  This changes\n  the C++ name mangling for interfaces involving this type.\n\n* The ucontext_t type no longer has the name struct ucontext.  This changes\n  the C++ name mangling for interfaces involving this type.\n\n* On M68k GNU/Linux and MIPS GNU/Linux, the fpregset_t type no longer has\n  the name struct fpregset.  On Nios II GNU/Linux, the mcontext_t type no\n  longer has the name struct mcontext.  On SPARC GNU/Linux, the struct\n  mc_fq, struct rwindow, struct fpq and struct fq types are no longer\n  defined in sys/ucontext.h, the mc_fpu_t type no longer has the name struct\n  mc_fpu, the gwindows_t type no longer has the name struct gwindows and the\n  fpregset_t type no longer has the name struct fpu.  This changes the C++\n  name mangling for interfaces involving those types.\n\n* On S/390 GNU/Linux, the constants defined by <sys/ptrace.h> have been\n  synced with the kernel:\n\n    - PTRACE_GETREGS, PTRACE_SETREGS, PTRACE_GETFPREGS and PTRACE_SETFPREGS\n      are not supported on this architecture and have been removed.\n\n    - PTRACE_SINGLEBLOCK, PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER, PTRACE_PEEKUSR_AREA,\n      PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA, PTRACE_GET_LAST_BREAK, PTRACE_ENABLE_TE,\n      PTRACE_DISABLE_TE and PTRACE_TE_ABORT_RAND have been added.\n\n  Programs that assume the GET/SETREGS ptrace requests are universally\n  available will now fail to build, instead of malfunctioning at runtime.\n\nChanges to build and runtime requirements:\n\n* Linux kernel 3.2 or later is required at runtime, on all architectures\n  supported by that kernel.  (This is a change from version 2.25 only for\n  x86-32 and x86-64.)\n\n* GNU Binutils 2.25 or later is now required to build the GNU C Library.\n\n* On most architectures, GCC 4.9 or later is required to build the GNU C\n  Library.  On powerpc64le, GCC 6.2 or later is required.\n\n  Older GCC versions and non-GNU compilers are still supported when\n  compiling programs that use the GNU C Library.  (We do not know exactly\n  how old, and some GNU extensions to C may be _de facto_ required.  If you\n  are interested in helping us make this statement less vague, please\n  contact libc-alpha@sourceware.org.)\n\nSecurity related changes:\n\n* The DNS stub resolver limits the advertised UDP buffer size to 1200 bytes,\n  to avoid fragmentation-based spoofing attacks (CVE-2017-12132).\n\n* LD_LIBRARY_PATH is now ignored in binaries running in privileged AT_SECURE\n  mode to guard against local privilege escalation attacks (CVE-2017-1000366).\n\n* Avoid printing a backtrace from the __stack_chk_fail function since it is\n  called on a corrupt stack and a backtrace is unreliable on a corrupt stack\n  (CVE-2010-3192).\n\n* A use-after-free vulnerability in clntudp_call in the Sun RPC system has been\n  fixed (CVE-2017-12133).\n\nThe following bugs are resolved with this

TR.  Note that not all functions from that TR are supported by the GNU C\n  Library.\n\n* The feature test macro __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__, from ISO/IEC TS\n  18661-1:2014, is supported to enable declarations of functions and macros\n  from that TS.  Note that not all features from that TS are supported by\n  the GNU C Library.\n\n* The feature test macro __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT__, from ISO/IEC TS\n  18661-4:2015, is supported to enable declarations of functions and macros\n  from that TS.  Note that most features from that TS are not supported by\n  the GNU C Library.\n\n* The nonstandard feature selection macros _REENTRANT and _THREAD_SAFE are\n  now treated as compatibility synonyms for _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.\n  Since the GNU C Library defaults to a much newer revision of POSIX, this\n  will only affect programs that specifically request an old conformance\n  mode.  For instance, a program compiled with -std=c89 -D_REENTRANT will\n  see a change in the visible declarations, but a program compiled with\n  just -D_REENTRANT, or -std=c99 -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L -D_REENTRANT,\n  will not.\n\n  Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be\n  defined by all multithreaded code, but glibc has not required this for\n  many years.\n\n* The inclusion of <sys/sysmacros.h> by <sys/types.h> is deprecated.  This\n  means that in a future release, the macros “major”, “minor”, and “makedev”\n  will only be available from <sys/sysmacros.h>.\n\n  These macros are not part of POSIX nor XSI, and their names frequently\n  collide with user code; see for instance glibc bug 19239 and Red Hat bug\n  130601.  <stdlib.h> includes <sys/types.h> under _GNU_SOURCE, and C++ code\n  presently cannot avoid being compiled under _GNU_SOURCE, exacerbating the\n  problem.\n\n* New <fenv.h> features from TS 18661-1:2014 are added to libm: the\n  fesetexcept, fetestexceptflag, fegetmode and fesetmode functions, the\n  femode_t type and the FE_DFL_MODE and FE_SNANS_ALWAYS_SIGNAL macros.\n\n* Integer width macros from TS 18661-1:2014 are added to <limits.h>:\n  CHAR_WIDTH, SCHAR_WIDTH, UCHAR_WIDTH, SHRT_WIDTH, USHRT_WIDTH, INT_WIDTH,\n  UINT_WIDTH, LONG_WIDTH, ULONG_WIDTH, LLONG_WIDTH, ULLONG_WIDTH; and to\n  <stdint.h>: INT8_WIDTH, UINT8_WIDTH, INT16_WIDTH, UINT16_WIDTH,\n  INT32_WIDTH, UINT32_WIDTH, INT64_WIDTH, UINT64_WIDTH, INT_LEAST8_WIDTH,\n  UINT_LEAST8_WIDTH, INT_LEAST16_WIDTH, UINT_LEAST16_WIDTH,\n  INT_LEAST32_WIDTH, UINT_LEAST32_WIDTH, INT_LEAST64_WIDTH,\n  UINT_LEAST64_WIDTH, INT_FAST8_WIDTH, UINT_FAST8_WIDTH, INT_FAST16_WIDTH,\n  UINT_FAST16_WIDTH, INT_FAST32_WIDTH, UINT_FAST32_WIDTH, INT_FAST64_WIDTH,\n  UINT_FAST64_WIDTH, INTPTR_WIDTH, UINTPTR_WIDTH, INTMAX_WIDTH,\n  UINTMAX_WIDTH, PTRDIFF_WIDTH, SIG_ATOMIC_WIDTH, SIZE_WIDTH, WCHAR_WIDTH,\n  WINT_WIDTH.\n\n* New <math.h> features are added from TS 18661-1:2014:\n\n  - Signaling NaN macros: SNANF, SNAN, SNANL.\n\n  - Nearest integer functions: roundeven, roundevenf, roundevenl, fromfp,\n    fromfpf, fromfpl, ufromfp, ufromfpf, ufromfpl, fromfpx, fromfpxf,\n    fromfpxl, ufromfpx, ufromfpxf, ufromfpxl.\n\n  - llogb functions: the llogb, llogbf and llogbl functions, and the\n    FP_LLOGB0 and FP_LLOGBNAN macros.\n\n  - Max-min magnitude functions: fmaxmag, fmaxmagf, fmaxmagl, fminmag,\n    fminmagf, fminmagl.\n\n  - Comparison macros: iseqsig.\n\n  - Classification macros: iscanonical, issubnormal, iszero.\n\n  - Total order functions: totalorder, totalorderf, totalorderl,\n    totalordermag, totalordermagf, totalordermagl.\n\n  - Canonicalize functions: canonicalize, canonicalizef, canonicalizel.\n\n  - NaN functions: getpayload, getpayloadf, getpayloadl, setpayload,\n    setpayloadf, setpayloadl, setpayloadsig, setpayloadsigf, setpayloadsigl.\n\n* The functions strfromd, strfromf, and strfroml, from ISO/IEC TS 18661-1:2014,\n  are added to libc.  They convert a floating-point number into string.\n\n* Most of glibc can now be built with the stack smashing protector enabled.\n  It is recommended to build glibc with --enable-stack-protector=strong.\n  Implemented by Nick Alcock (Oracle).\n\n* The function explicit_bzero, from OpenBSD, has been added to libc.  It is\n  intended to be used instead of memset() to erase sensitive data after use;\n  the compiler will not optimize out calls to explicit_bzero even if they\n  are \"unnecessary\" (in the sense that no _correct_ program can observe the\n  effects of the memory clear).\n\n* On ColdFire, MicroBlaze, Nios II and SH3, the float_t type is now defined\n  to float instead of double.  This does not affect the ABI of any libraries\n  that are part of the GNU C Library, but may affect the ABI of other\n  libraries that use this type in their interfaces.\n\n* On x86_64, when compiling with -mfpmath=387 or -mfpmath=sse+387, the\n  float_t and double_t types are now defined to long double instead of float\n  and double.  These options are not the default, and this does not affect\n  the ABI of any libraries that are part of the GNU C Library, but it may\n  affect the ABI of other libraries that use this type in their interfaces,\n  if they are compiled or used with those options.\n\n* The getentropy and getrandom functions, and the <sys/random.h> header file\n  have been added.\n\n* The buffer size for byte-oriented stdio streams is now limited to 8192\n  bytes by default.  Previously, on Linux, the default buffer size on most\n  file systems was 4096 bytes (and thus remains unchanged), except on\n  network file systems, where the buffer size was unpredictable and could be\n  as large as several megabytes.\n\n* The <sys/quota.h> header now includes the <linux/quota.h> header.  Support\n  for the Linux quota interface which predates kernel version 2.4.22 has\n  been removed.\n\n* The malloc_get_state and malloc_set_state functions have been removed.\n  Already-existing binaries that dynamically link to these functions will\n  get a hidden implementation in which malloc_get_state is a stub.  As far\n  as we know, these functions are used only by GNU Emacs and this change\n  will not adversely affect already-built Emacs executables.  Any undumped\n  Emacs executables, which normally exist only during an Emacs build, should\n  be rebuilt by re-running “./configure; make” in the Emacs build tree.\n\n* The “ip6-dotint” and “no-ip6-dotint” resolver options, and the\n  corresponding RES_NOIP6DOTINT flag from <resolv.h> have been removed.\n  “no-ip6-dotint” had already been the default, and support for the\n  “ip6-dotint” option was removed from the Internet in 2006.\n\n* The \"ip6-bytestring\" resolver option and the corresponding RES_USEBSTRING\n  flag from <resolv.h> have been removed.  The option relied on a\n  backwards-incompatible DNS extension which was never deployed on the\n  Internet.\n\n* The flags RES_AAONLY, RES_PRIMARY, RES_NOCHECKNAME, RES_KEEPTSIG,\n  RES_BLAST defined in the <resolv.h> header file have been deprecated.\n  They were already unimplemented.\n\n* The \"inet6\" option in /etc/resolv.conf and the RES_USE_INET6 flag for\n  _res.flags are deprecated.  The flag was standardized in RFC 2133, but\n  removed again from the IETF name lookup interface specification in RFC\n  2553.  Applications should use getaddrinfo instead.\n\n* DNSSEC-related declarations and definitions have been removed from the\n  <arpa/nameser.h> header file, and libresolv will no longer attempt to\n  decode the data part of DNSSEC record types.  Previous versions of glibc\n  only implemented minimal support for the previous version of DNSSEC, which\n  is incompatible with the currently deployed version.\n\n* The resource record type classification macros ns_t_qt_p, ns_t_mrr_p,\n  ns_t_rr_p, ns_t_udp_p, ns_t_xfr_p have been removed from the\n  <arpa/nameser.h> header file because the distinction between RR types and\n  meta-RR types is not officially standardized, subject to revision, and\n  thus not suitable for encoding in a macro.\n\n* The types res_sendhookact, res_send_qhook, re_send_rhook, and the qhook\n  and rhook members of the res_state type in <resolv.h> have been removed.\n  The glibc stub resolver did not support these hooks, but the header file\n  did not reflect that.\n\n* For multi-arch support it is recommended to use a GCC which has\n  been built with support for GNU indirect functions.  This ensures\n  that correct debugging information is generated for functions\n  selected by IFUNC resolvers.  This support can either be enabled by\n  configuring GCC with '--enable-gnu-indirect-function', or by\n  enabling it by default by setting 'default_gnu_indirect_function'\n  variable for a particular architecture in the GCC source file\n  'gcc/config.gcc'.\n\n* GDB pretty printers have been added for mutex and condition variable\n  structures in POSIX Threads. When installed and loaded in gdb these pretty\n  printers show various pthread variables in human-readable form when read\n  using the 'print' or 'display' commands in gdb.\n\n* Tunables feature added to allow tweaking of the runtime for an application\n  program.  This feature can be enabled with the '--enable-tunables' configure\n  flag.  The GNU C Library manual has details on usage and README.tunables has\n  instructions on adding new tunables to the library.\n\n* A new version of condition variables functions have been implemented in\n  the NPTL implementation of POSIX Threads to provide stronger ordering\n  guarantees.\n\n* A new version of pthread_rwlock functions have been implemented to use a more\n  scalable algorithm primarily through not using a critical section anymore to\n  make state changes.\n\nSecurity related changes:\n\n* On ARM EABI (32-bit), generating a backtrace for execution contexts which\n  have been created with makecontext could fail to terminate due to a\n  missing .cantunwind annotation.  This has been observed to lead to a hang\n  (denial of service) in some Go applications compiled with gccgo.  Reported\n  by Andreas Schwab.  (CVE-2016-6323)\n\n* The DNS stub resolver functions would crash due to a NULL pointer\n  dereference when processing a query with a valid DNS question type which\n  was used internally in the implementation.  The stub resolver now uses a\n  question type which is outside the range of valid question type values.\n  (CVE-2015-5180)\n\nThe following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  [4099] stdio:

that this version of the GNU C Library\n  can be used with is 3.2, except on i[4567]86 and x86_64, where Linux\n  kernel version 2.6.32 or later suffices (on architectures that already\n  required kernel versions more recent than 3.2, those requirements remain\n  unchanged).  Linux 3.2 or later kernel headers are required on all\n  architectures.\n\n* The pap_AN locale has been deleted.  This has been deprecated for a long\n  time.  It has been replaced by pap_AW & pap_CW, both of which have long\n  been included in previous releases.\n\n* The readdir_r and readdir64_r functions have been deprecated.  It is\n  recommended to use readdir and readdir64 instead.\n\n* The type “union wait” has been removed.  It was deprecated in the early\n  1990s and never part of POSIX.  Application code should use the int type\n  instead of “union wait”.\n\n* A new NSS action is added to facilitate large distributed system\n  administration.  The action, MERGE, allows remote user stores like LDAP\n  to be merged into local user stores like /etc/groups in order to provide\n  easy to use, updated, and managed sets of merged credentials.  The new\n  action can be used by configuring it in /etc/nsswitch.conf:\n  group: files [SUCCESS=merge] nis\n  Implemented by Stephen Gallagher (Red Hat).\n\n* The deprecated __malloc_initialize_hook variable has been removed from the\n  API.\n\n* The long unused localedef --old-style option has been removed.  It hasn't\n  done anything in over 16 years.  Scripts using this option can safely\n  drop it.\n\n* nextupl, nextup, nextupf, nextdownl, nextdown and nextdownf are added to\n  libm.  They are defined by TS 18661 and IEEE754-2008.  The nextup functions\n  return the next representable value in the direction of positive infinity\n  and the nextdown functions return the next representable value in the\n  direction of negative infinity.  These are currently enabled as GNU\n  extensions.\n\nSecurity related changes:\n\n* An unnecessary stack copy in _nss_dns_getnetbyname_r was removed.  It\n  could result in a stack overflow when getnetbyname was called with an\n  overly long name.  (CVE-2016-3075)\n\n* Previously, getaddrinfo copied large amounts of address data to the stack,\n  even after the fix for CVE-2013-4458 has been applied, potentially\n  resulting in a stack overflow.  getaddrinfo now uses a heap allocation\n  instead.  Reported by Michael Petlan.  (CVE-2016-3706)\n\n* The glob function suffered from a stack-based buffer overflow when it was\n  called with the GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC flag and encountered a long file name.\n  Reported by Alexander Cherepanov.  (CVE-2016-1234)\n\n* The Sun RPC UDP client could exhaust all available stack space when\n  flooded with crafted ICMP and UDP messages.  Reported by Aldy Hernandez'\n  alloca plugin for GCC.  (CVE-2016-4429)\n\n* The IPv6 name server management code in libresolv could result in a memory\n  leak for each thread which is created, performs a failing naming lookup,\n  and exits.  Over time, this could result in a denial of service due to\n  memory exhaustion.  Reported by Matthias Schiffer.

libmvec-sincos-avx* tests on non avx machines\n\f\nVersion 2.23\n\n* Unicode 8.0.0 Support: Character encoding, character type info, and\n  transliteration tables are all updated to Unicode 8.0.0, using new\n  and/or improved generator scripts contributed by Mike FABIAN (Red Hat).\n  These updates cause user visible changes, such as the fixes for bugs\n  89, 16061, and 18568.\n\n* sched_setaffinity, pthread_setaffinity_np no longer attempt to guess the\n  kernel-internal CPU set size.  This means that requests that change the\n  CPU affinity which failed before (for example, an all-ones CPU mask) will\n  now succeed.  Applications that need to determine the effective CPU\n  affinities need to call sched_getaffinity or pthread_getaffinity_np after\n  setting it because the kernel can adjust it (and the previous size check\n  would not detect this in the majority of cases).\n\n* The fts.h header can now be used with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.  With LFS\n  the following new symbols are used: fts64_children, fts64_close,\n  fts64_open, fts64_read and fts64_set.\n\n* getaddrinfo now detects certain invalid responses on an internal netlink\n  socket.  If such responses are received, an affected process will\n  terminate with an error message of \"Unexpected error <number> on netlink\n  descriptor <number>\" or \"Unexpected netlink response of size <number> on\n  descriptor <number>\".  The most likely cause for these errors is a\n  multi-threaded application which erroneously closes and reuses the netlink\n  file descriptor while it is used by getaddrinfo.\n\n* A defect in the malloc implementation, present since glibc 2.15 (2012) or\n  glibc 2.10 via --enable-experimental-malloc (2009), could result in the\n  unnecessary serialization of memory allocation requests across threads.\n  The defect is now corrected.  Users should see a substantial increase in\n  the concurent throughput of allocation requests for applications which\n  trigger this bug.  Affected applications typically create and\n  destroy threads frequently.  (Bug 19048 was reported and analyzed by\n  Ericsson.)\n\n* There is now a --disable-timezone-tools configure option for disabling the\n  building and installing of the timezone related utilities (zic, zdump, and\n  tzselect).  This is useful for people who build the timezone data and code\n  independent of the GNU C Library.\n\n* The obsolete header <regexp.h> has been removed.  Programs that require\n  this header must be updated to use <regex.h> instead.\n\n* The obsolete functions bdflush, create_module, get_kernel_syms,\n  query_module and uselib are no longer available to newly linked binaries;\n  the header <sys/kdaemon.h> has been removed.  These functions and header\n  were specific to systems using the Linux kernel and could not usefully be\n  used with the GNU C Library on systems with version 2.6 or later of the\n  Linux kernel.\n\n* Optimized string, wcsmbs and memory functions for IBM z13.\n  Implemented by Stefan Liebler.\n\n* Newly linked programs that define a variable called signgam will no longer\n  have it set by the lgamma, lgammaf and lgammal functions.  Programs that\n  require signgam to be set by those functions must ensure that they use the\n  variable provided by the GNU C Library and declared in <math.h>, without\n  defining their own copy.\n\n* The minimum GCC version that can be used to build this version of the GNU\n  C Library is GCC 4.7.  Older GCC versions, and non-GNU compilers, can\n  still be used to compile programs using the GNU C Library.\n\nSecurity related changes:\n\n* An out-of-bounds value in a broken-out struct tm argument to strftime no\n  longer causes a crash.  Reported by Adam Nielsen.  (CVE-2015-8776)\n\n* The LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable can no longer be used to disable\n  the pointer guard feature.  It is always enabled.  Previously,\n  LD_POINTER_GUARD could be used to disable security hardening in binaries\n  running in privileged AT_SECURE mode.  Reported by Hector Marco-Gisbert.\n  (CVE-2015-8777)\n\n* An integer overflow in hcreate and hcreate_r could lead to an\n  out-of-bounds memory access.  Reported by Szabolcs Nagy.  (CVE-2015-8778)\n\n* The catopen function no longer has unbounded stack usage.  Reported by\n  Max.  (CVE-2015-8779)\n\n* The nan, nanf and nanl functions no longer have unbounded stack usage\n  depending on the length of the string passed as an argument to the\n  functions.  Reported by Joseph Myers.  (CVE-2014-9761)\n\n* A stack-based buffer overflow was found in libresolv when invoked from\n  libnss_dns, allowing specially crafted DNS responses to seize control\n  of execution flow in the DNS client.  The buffer overflow occurs in\n  the functions send_dg (send datagram) and send_vc (send TCP) for the\n  NSS module libnss_dns.so.2 when calling getaddrinfo with AF_UNSPEC\n  family.  The use of AF_UNSPEC triggers the low-level resolver code to\n  send out two parallel queries for A and AAAA.  A mismanagement of the\n  buffers used for those queries could result in the response of a query\n  writing beyond the alloca allocated buffer created by\n  _nss_dns_gethostbyname4_r.  Buffer management is simplified to remove\n  the overflow.  Thanks to the Google Security Team and Red Hat for\n  reporting the security impact of this issue, and Robert Holiday of\n  Ciena for reporting the related bug 18665.

gethostbyname_r and related functions performing DNS\n  requests has been fixed.  If the NSS functions were called with a\n  misaligned buffer, the buffer length change due to pointer alignment was\n  not taken into account.  This could result in application crashes or,\n  potentially arbitrary code execution, using crafted, but syntactically\n  valid DNS responses.  (CVE-2015-1781)\n\n* The time zone file parser has been made more robust against crafted time\n  zone files, avoiding heap buffer overflows related to the processing of\n  the tzh_ttisstdcnt and tzh_ttisgmtcnt fields, and a stack overflow due to\n  large time zone data files.  Overly long time zone specifiers in the TZ\n  variable no longer result in stack overflows and crashes.\n\n* A powerpc and powerpc64 optimization for TLS, similar to TLS descriptors\n  for LD and GD on x86 and x86-64, has been implemented.  You will need\n  binutils-2.24 or later to enable this optimization.\n\n* Character encoding and ctype tables were updated to Unicode 7.0.0, using\n  new generator scripts contributed by Pravin Satpute and Mike FABIAN (Red\n  Hat).  These updates cause user visible changes, such as the fix for bug\n  17998.\n\n* CVE-2014-8121 The NSS backends shared internal state between the getXXent\n  and getXXbyYY NSS calls for the same database, causing a denial-of-service\n  condition in some applications.\n\n* Added vector math library named libmvec with the following vectorized x86_64\n  implementations: cos, cosf, sin, sinf, sincos, sincosf, log, logf, exp, expf,\n  pow, powf.\n  The library can be disabled with --disable-mathvec. Use of the functions is\n  enabled with -fopenmp -ffast-math starting from -O1 for GCC version >= 4.9.0.\n  Shared library libmvec.so is linked in as needed when using -lm (no need to\n  specify -lmvec explicitly for not static builds).\n  Visit <https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/libmvec> for detailed information.\n\n* A new fmemopen implementation has been added with the goal of POSIX\n  compliance. The new implementation fixes the following long-standing\n  issues: BZ#6544, BZ#11216, BZ#12836, BZ#13151, BZ#13152, and BZ#14292. The\n  old implementation is still present for use be by existing binaries.\n\n* The 32-bit sparc sigaction ABI was inadvertently broken in the 2.20 and 2.21\n  releases.  It has been fixed to match 2.19 and older, but binaries built\n  against 2.20 and 2.21 might need to be recompiled.  See BZ#18694.\n\n* Port to Native Client running on ARMv7-A (--host=arm-nacl).\n  Contributed by Roland McGrath (Google).\n\n* The header <regexp.h> is deprecated, and will be removed in a future\n  release.  Use of this header will trigger a deprecation warning.\n  Application developers should update their code to use <regex.h> instead.\n\n  This header was formerly part of SUS, but was deprecated in 1994 and\n  removed from the standard in 2001.  Also, the glibc implementation\n  leaks memory.  See BZ#18681 for more details.\n\f\nVersion 2.21\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  6652, 10672, 12674, 12847, 12926, 13862, 14132, 14138, 14171, 14498,\n  15215, 15378, 15884, 16009, 16418, 16191, 16469, 16576, 16617, 16618,\n  16619, 16657, 16740, 16857, 17192, 17266, 17273, 17344, 17363, 17370,\n  17371, 17411, 17460, 17475, 17485, 17501, 17506, 17508, 17522, 17555,\n  17570, 17571, 17572, 17573, 17574, 17582, 17583, 17584, 17585, 17589,\n  17594, 17601, 17608, 17616, 17625, 17630, 17633, 17634, 17635, 17647,\n  17653, 17657, 17658, 17664, 17665, 17668, 17682, 17702, 17717, 17719,\n  17722, 17723, 17724, 17725, 17732, 17733, 17744, 17745, 17746, 17747,\n  17748, 17775, 17777, 17780, 17781, 17782, 17791, 17793, 17796, 17797,\n  17801, 17803, 17806, 17834, 17844, 17848, 17868, 17869, 17870, 17885,\n  17892.\n\n* CVE-2015-1472 CVE-2015-1473 Under certain conditions wscanf can allocate\n  too little memory for the to-be-scanned arguments and overflow the\n  allocated buffer.  The implementation now correctly computes the required\n  buffer size when using malloc, and switches to malloc from alloca as\n  intended.\n\n* A new semaphore algorithm has been implemented in generic C code for all\n  machines. Previous custom assembly implementations of semaphore were\n  difficult to reason about or ensure that they were safe. The new version\n  of semaphore supports machines with 64-bit or 32-bit atomic operations.\n  The new semaphore algorithm is used by sem_init, sem_open, sem_post,\n  sem_wait, sem_timedwait, sem_trywait, and sem_getvalue.\n\n* Port to Altera Nios II has been contributed by Mentor Graphics.\n\n* Optimized strcpy, stpcpy, strncpy, stpncpy, strcmp, and strncmp\n  implementations for powerpc64/powerpc64le.\n  Implemented by Adhemerval Zanella (IBM).\n\n* Added support for TSX lock elision of pthread mutexes on powerpc32, powerpc64\n  and powerpc64le.  This may improve lock scaling of existing programs on\n  HTM capable systems.  The lock elision code is only enabled with\n  --enable-lock-elision=yes.  Also, the TSX lock elision implementation for\n  powerpc will issue a transaction abort on every syscall to avoid side\n  effects being visible outside transactions.\n\n* Optimized strcpy, stpcpy, strchrnul and strrchr implementations for\n  AArch64.  Contributed by ARM Ltd.\n\n* i386 memcpy functions optimized with SSE2 unaligned load/store.\n\n* CVE-2104-7817 The wordexp function could ignore the WRDE_NOCMD flag\n  under certain input conditions resulting in the execution of a shell for\n  command substitution when the application did not request it. The\n  implementation now checks WRDE_NOCMD immediately before executing the\n  shell and returns the error WRDE_CMDSUB as expected.\n\n* CVE-2012-3406 printf-style functions could run into a stack overflow when\n  processing format strings with a large number of format specifiers.\n\n* CVE-2014-9402 The nss_dns implementation of getnetbyname could run into an\n  infinite loop if the DNS response contained a PTR record of an unexpected\n  format.\n\n* The minimum GCC version that can be used to build this version of the GNU\n  C Library is GCC 4.6.  Older GCC versions, and non-GNU compilers, can\n  still be used to compile programs using the GNU C Library.\n\n* The GNU C Library is now built with -Werror by default.  This can be\n  disabled by configuring with --disable-werror.\n\n* New locales: tu_IN, bh_IN, raj_IN, ce_RU.\n\n* The obsolete sigvec function has been removed.  This was the original\n  4.2BSD interface that inspired the POSIX.1 sigaction interface, which\n  programs have been using instead for about 25 years.  Of course, ABI\n  compatibility for old binaries using sigvec remains intact.\n\n* Merged gettext 0.19.3 into the intl subdirectory.  This fixes building\n  with newer versions of bison.\n\n* Support for MIPS o32 FPXX, FP64A and FP64 ABI Extensions.\n  The original MIPS o32 hard-float ABI requires an FPU where double-precision\n  registers overlay two consecutive single-precision registers.  MIPS32R2\n  introduced a new FPU mode (FR=1) where double-precision registers extend the\n  corresponding single-precision registers which is incompatible with the\n  o32 hard-float ABI.  The MIPS SIMD ASE and the MIPSR6 architecture both\n  require the use of FR=1 making a transition necessary.  New o32 ABI\n  extensions enable users to migrate over time from the original o32 ABI\n  through to the updated o32 FP64 ABI.  To achieve this the dynamic linker now\n  tracks the ABI of any loaded object and verifies that new objects are\n  compatible.  Mode transitions will also be requested as required and\n  unsupportable objects will be rejected.  The ABI checks include both soft and\n  hard float ABIs for o32, n32 and n64.\n\n  GCC 5 with GNU binutils 2.25 onwards:\n  It is strongly recommended that all o32 system libraries are built using the\n  new o32 FPXX ABI (-mfpxx) to facilitate the transition as this is compatible\n  with the original and all new o32 ABI extensions.  Configure a MIPS GCC\n  compiler using --with-fp-32=xx to set this by default.\n\f\nVersion 2.20\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  6804, 9894, 11505, 12994, 13347, 13651, 14308, 14770, 15119, 15132, 15347,\n  15514, 15698, 15804, 15894, 15946, 16002, 16064, 16095, 16194, 16198,\n  16275, 16284, 16287, 16315, 16348, 16349, 16354, 16357, 16362, 16447,\n  16516, 16532, 16539, 16545, 16561, 16562, 16564, 16574, 16599, 16600,\n  16609, 16610, 16611, 16613, 16619, 16623, 16629, 16632, 16634, 16639,\n  16642, 16648, 16649, 16670, 16674, 16677, 16680, 16681, 16683, 16689,\n  16695, 16701, 16706, 16707, 16712, 16713, 16714, 16724, 16731, 16739,\n  16740, 16743, 16754, 16758, 16759, 16760, 16770, 16786, 16789, 16791,\n  16796, 16799, 16800, 16815, 16823, 16824, 16831, 16838, 16839, 16849,\n  16854, 16876, 16877, 16878, 16882, 16885, 16888, 16890, 16892, 16912,\n  16915, 16916, 16917, 16918, 16922, 16927, 16928, 16932, 16943, 16958,\n  16965, 16966, 16967, 16977, 16978, 16984, 16990, 16996, 17009, 17022,\n  17031, 17042, 17048, 17050, 17058, 17061, 17062, 17069, 17075, 17078,\n  17079, 17084, 17086, 17088, 17092, 17097, 17125, 17135, 17137, 17150,\n  17153, 17187, 17213, 17259, 17261, 17262, 17263, 17319, 17325, 17354.\n\n* Reverted change of ABI data structures for s390 and s390x:\n  On s390 and s390x the size of struct ucontext and jmp_buf was increased in\n  2.19. This change is reverted in 2.20. The introduced 2.19 symbol versions\n  of getcontext, setjmp, _setjmp, __sigsetjmp, longjmp, _longjmp, siglongjmp\n  are preserved pointing straight to the same implementation as the old ones.\n  Given that, new callers will simply provide a too-big buffer to these\n  functions. Any applications/libraries out there that embed jmp_buf or\n  ucontext_t in an ABI-relevant data structure that have already been rebuilt\n  against 2.19 headers will have to rebuilt again. This is necessary in any\n  case to revert the breakage in their ABI caused by the glibc change.\n\n* Support for file description locks is added to systems running the\n  Linux kernel. The standard file locking interfaces are extended to\n  operate on file descriptions, not file descriptors, via the use of\n  F_OFD_GETLK, F_OFD_SETLK, and F_OFD_SETLKW. File description locks\n  are associated with an open file instead of a process.\n\n* Optimized strchr implementation for AArch64.  Contributed by ARM Ltd.\n\n* The minimum Linux kernel version that this version of the GNU C Library\n  can be used with is 2.6.32.\n\n* Running the testsuite no longer terminates as soon as a test fails.\n  Instead, a file tests.sum (xtests.sum from \"make xcheck\") is generated,\n  with PASS or FAIL lines for individual tests.  A summary of the results is\n  printed, including a list of failing lists, and \"make check\" exits with\n  error status if there were any unexpected failures.  \"make check\n  stop-on-test-failure=y\" may be used to keep the old behavior.\n\n* The am33 port, which had not worked for several years, has been removed\n  from ports.\n\n* The _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE feature test macros are no longer\n  supported; they now act the same as _DEFAULT_SOURCE (but generate a\n  warning).  Except for cases where _BSD_SOURCE enabled BSD interfaces that\n  conflicted with POSIX (support for which was removed in 2.19), the\n  interfaces those macros enabled remain available when compiling with\n  _GNU_SOURCE defined, with _DEFAULT_SOURCE defined, or without any feature\n  test macros defined.\n\n* Optimized strcmp implementation for ARMv7.  Contributed by ARM Ltd.\n\n* Added support for TX lock elision of pthread mutexes on s390 and s390x.\n  This may improve lock scaling of existing programs on TX capable systems.\n  The lock elision code is only built with --enable-lock-elision=yes and\n  then requires a GCC version supporting the TX builtins.  With lock elision\n  default mutexes are elided via __builtin_tbegin, if the cpu supports\n  transactions. By default lock elision is not enabled and the elision code\n  is not built.\n\n* CVE-2014-4043 The posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen implementation did not\n  copy the path argument.  This allowed programs to cause posix_spawn to\n  deference a dangling pointer, or use an unexpected pathname argument if\n  the string was modified after the posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen\n  invocation.\n\n* All supported architectures now use the main glibc sysdeps directory\n  instead of some being in a separate \"ports\" directory (which was\n  distributed separately before glibc 2.17).\n\n* The NPTL implementation of POSIX pthreads is no longer an \"add-on\".\n  On configurations that support it (all Linux configurations), it's now\n  used regardless of the --enable-add-ons switch to configure.  It is no\n  longer possible to build such configurations without pthreads support.\n\n* Locale names, including those obtained from environment variables (LANG\n  and the LC_* variables), are more tightly checked for proper syntax.\n  setlocale will now fail (with EINVAL) for locale names that are overly\n  long, contain slashes without starting with a slash, or contain \"..\" path\n  components. (CVE-2014-0475)  Previously, some valid locale names were\n  silently replaced with the \"C\" locale when running in AT_SECURE mode\n  (e.g., in a SUID program).  This is no longer necessary because of the\n  additional checks.\n\n* On x86-64, the dynamic linker's lazy-binding support is now compatible\n  with application code using Intel MPX instructions.  (With all previous\n  versions, the MPX register state could be clobbered when making calls\n  into or out of a shared library.)  Note that while the new dynamic\n  linker is compatible with all known x86 hardware whether or not it\n  supports Intel MPX, some x86 instruction-set emulators might fail to\n  handle the new instruction encodings.  This is known to affect Valgrind\n  versions up through 3.9 (but will be fixed in the forthcoming 3.10\n  release), and might affect other tools that do instruction emulation.\n\n* Support for loadable gconv transliteration modules has been removed.\n  The support for transliteration modules has been non-functional for\n  over a decade, and the removal is prompted by security defects.  The\n  normal gconv conversion modules are still supported.  Transliteration\n  with //TRANSLIT is still possible, and the //IGNORE specifier\n  continues to be  supported. (CVE-2014-5119)\n\n* Decoding a crafted input sequence in the character sets IBM933, IBM935,\n  IBM937, IBM939, IBM1364 could result in an out-of-bounds array read,\n  resulting a denial-of-service security vulnerability in applications which\n  use functions related to iconv. (CVE-2014-6040)\n\f\nVersion 2.19\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  156, 387, 431, 762, 832, 926, 2801, 4772, 6786, 6787, 6807, 6810, 6981,\n  7003, 9721, 9954, 10253, 10278, 11087, 11157, 11214, 12100, 12486, 12751,\n  12986, 13028, 13982, 13985, 14029, 14032, 14120, 14143, 14155, 14286,\n  14547, 14699, 14752, 14782, 14876, 14910, 15004, 15048, 15073, 15089,\n  15128, 15218, 15268, 15277, 15308, 15362, 15374, 15400, 15425, 15427,\n  15483, 15522, 15531, 15532, 15593, 15601, 15608, 15609, 15610, 15632,\n  15640, 15670, 15672, 15680, 15681, 15723, 15734, 15735, 15736, 15748,\n  15749, 15754, 15760, 15763, 15764, 15797, 15799, 15825, 15843, 15844,\n  15846, 15847, 15849, 15850, 15855, 15856, 15857, 15859, 15867, 15886,\n  15887, 15890, 15892, 15893, 15895, 15897, 15901, 15905, 15909, 15915,\n  15917, 15919, 15921, 15923, 15939, 15941, 15948, 15963, 15966, 15968,\n  15985, 15988, 15997, 16032, 16034, 16036, 16037, 16038, 16041, 16046,\n  16055, 16071, 16072, 16074, 16077, 16078, 16103, 16112, 16143, 16144,\n  16146, 16150, 16151, 16153, 16167, 16169, 16172, 16195, 16214, 16245,\n  16271, 16274, 16283, 16289, 16293, 16314, 16316, 16330, 16337, 16338,\n  16356, 16365, 16366, 16369, 16372, 16375, 16379, 16381, 16384, 16385,\n  16386, 16387, 16390, 16394, 16398, 16400, 16407, 16408, 16414, 16430,\n  16431, 16453, 16474, 16506, 16510, 16529\n\n* Slovenian translations for glibc messages have been contributed by the\n  Translation Project's Slovenian team of translators.\n\n* The public headers no longer use __unused nor __block.  This change is to\n  support compiling programs that are derived from BSD sources and use\n  __unused internally, and to support compiling with Clang's -fblock\n  extension which uses __block.\n\n* CVE-2012-4412 The strcoll implementation caches indices and rules for\n  large collation sequences to optimize multiple passes.  This cache\n  computation may overflow for large collation sequences and may cause a\n  stack or buffer overflow.  This is now fixed to use a slower algorithm\n  which does not use a cache if there is an integer overflow.\n\n* CVE-2012-4424 The strcoll implementation uses malloc to cache indices and\n  rules for large collation sequences to optimize multiple passes and falls\n  back to alloca if malloc fails, resulting in a possible stack overflow.\n  The implementation now falls back to an uncached collation sequence lookup\n  if malloc fails.\n\n* CVE-2013-4788 The pointer guard used for pointer mangling was not\n  initialized for static applications resulting in the security feature\n  being disabled. The pointer guard is now correctly initialized to a\n  random value for static applications. Existing static applications need\n  to be recompiled to take advantage of the fix (bug 15754).\n\n* CVE-2013-4237 The readdir_r function could write more than NAME_MAX bytes\n  to the d_name member of struct dirent, or omit the terminating NUL\n  character.  (Bugzilla #14699).\n\n* CVE-2013-4332 The pvalloc, valloc, memalign, posix_memalign and\n  aligned_alloc functions could allocate too few bytes or corrupt the\n  heap when passed very large allocation size values (Bugzilla #15855,\n  #15856, #15857).\n\n* CVE-2013-4458 Stack overflow in getaddrinfo with large number of results\n  for AF_INET6 has been fixed (Bugzilla #16072).\n\n* New locales: ak_GH, anp_IN, ar_SS, cmn_TW, hak_TW, lzh_TW, nan_TW, pap_AW,\n  pap_CW, quz_PE, the_NP.\n\n* Substantially revised locales: gd_GB, ht_HT\n\n* The LC_ADDRESS field was updated to support country_car for almost all\n  supported locales.\n\n* ISO 1427 definitions were updated.\n\n* ISO 3166 definitions were updated.\n\n* The localedef utility now supports --big-endian and --little-endian\n  command-line options to generate locales for a different system from that\n  for which the C library was built.\n\n* Binary locale files now only depend on the endianness of the system for\n  which they are generated and not on other properties of that system.  As a\n  consequence, binary files generated with new localedef may be incompatible\n  with old versions of the GNU C Library, and binary files generated with\n  old localedef may be incompatible with this version of the GNU C Library,\n  in the following circumstances:\n\n  + Locale files may be incompatible on m68k systems.\n\n  + Locale archive files (but not separate files for individual locales) may\n    be incompatible on systems where plain \"char\" is signed.\n\n* The configure option --disable-versioning has been removed.  Builds with\n  --disable-versioning had not worked for several years.\n\n* ISO 639 definitions were updated for Chiga (cgg) and Chinese (gan, hak, czh,\n  cjy, lzh, cmn, mnp, cdo, czo, cpx, wuu, hsn, yue).\n\n* SystemTap probes for malloc have been introduced.\n\n* SystemTap probes for slow multiple precision fallback paths of\n  transcendental functions have been introduced.\n\n* Support for powerpc64le has been added.\n\n* The soft-float powerpc port now supports e500 processors.\n\n* Support for STT_GNU_IFUNC symbols added for ppc32/power4+ and ppc64.\n\n* A new feature test macro _DEFAULT_SOURCE is available to enable the same\n  set of header declarations that are enabled by default, even when other\n  feature test macros or compiler options such as -std=c99 would otherwise\n  disable some of those declarations.\n\n* The _BSD_SOURCE feature test macro no longer enables BSD interfaces that\n  conflict with POSIX.  The libbsd-compat library (which was a dummy library\n  that did nothing) has also been removed.\n\n* Preliminary documentation about Multi-Thread, Async-Signal and\n  Async-Cancel Safety has been added.\n\n* Change of ABI data structures for s390 and s390x:\n  On s390 and s390x the size of struct ucontext and jmp_buf was increased to\n  allow for future hardware extensions. All library functions that accept or\n  return these structures were versioned in order to provide backwards\n  compatibility with existing code. However, not all cases can be handled\n  with interface versioning. If an application embeds either structure into\n  another structure and that structure is passed to another compilation unit\n  which expects the newer larger-sized object then any access to the new\n  fields will result in undefined behaviour. Similarly any access to fields\n  that were moved by the enlarging of the structures will cause undefined\n  behaviour. To fix the undefined behaviour all objects that are part of the\n  final in-memory image must agree on the size of structures, and this may\n  require recompilation.\n\f\nVersion 2.18\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  2546, 2560, 5159, 6809, 7006, 10060, 10062, 10283, 10357, 10686, 11120,\n  11561, 12310, 12387, 12492, 12515, 12723, 13550, 13889, 13951, 13988,\n  14142, 14176, 14200, 14256, 14280, 14293, 14317, 14327, 14478, 14496,\n  14582, 14686, 14812, 14888, 14894, 14907, 14908, 14909, 14920, 14941,\n  14952, 14964, 14981, 14982, 14985, 14991, 14994, 14996, 15000, 15003,\n  15006, 15007, 15014, 15020, 15022, 15023, 15036, 15054, 15055, 15062,\n  15078, 15084, 15085, 15086, 15100, 15160, 15214, 15221, 15232, 15234,\n  15283, 15285, 15287, 15304, 15305, 15307, 15309, 15327, 15330, 15335,\n  15336, 15337, 15339, 15342, 15346, 15359, 15361, 15366, 15380, 15381,\n  15394, 15395, 15405, 15406, 15409, 15416, 15418, 15419, 15423, 15424,\n  15426, 15429, 15431, 15432, 15441, 15442, 15448, 15465, 15480, 15485,\n  15488, 15490, 15492, 15493, 15497, 15506, 15529, 15536, 15553, 15577,\n  15583, 15618, 15627, 15631, 15654, 15655, 15666, 15667, 15674, 15711,\n  15755, 15759.\n\n* CVE-2013-2207 Incorrectly granting access to another user's pseudo-terminal\n  has been fixed by disabling the use of pt_chown (Bugzilla #15755).\n  Distributions can re-enable building and using pt_chown via the new configure\n  option `--enable-pt_chown'.  Enabling the use of pt_chown carries with it\n  considerable security risks and should only be used if the distribution\n  understands and accepts the risks.\n\n* CVE-2013-0242 Buffer overrun in regexp matcher has been fixed (Bugzilla\n  #15078).\n\n* CVE-2013-1914 Stack overflow in getaddrinfo with many results has been\n  fixed (Bugzilla #15330).\n\n* Add support for calling C++11 thread_local object destructors on thread\n  and program exit.  This needs compiler support for offloading C++11\n  destructor calls to glibc.\n\n* Improved worst case performance of libm functions with double inputs and\n  output.\n\n* Support for priority inherited mutexes in pthread condition variables on\n  non-x86 architectures.\n\n* Port to Xilinx MicroBlaze contributed by David Holsgrove.\n\n* Optimized string functions for AArch64.  Implemented by Marcus Shawcroft.\n\n* Optimized string functions for ARM.  Implemented by Will Newton and\n  Richard Henderson.\n\n* Optimized libm functions for SPARC.  Implemented by David S. Miller.\n\n* Support for building more of ARM glibc as Thumb-2 code.  Implemented by\n  Richard Henderson.\n\n* Support for building most of MIPS glibc as MIPS16 code.  Implemented by\n  Chung-Lin Tang, Maciej W. Rozycki and Maxim Kuvyrkov.\n\n* Added a benchmark framework to track performance of functions in glibc.\n\n* New <math.h> macro named issignaling to check for a signaling NaN (sNaN).\n  It is based on draft TS 18661 and currently enabled as a GNU extension.\n\n* On Linux, the clock function now uses the clock_gettime system call\n  for improved precision, rather than old times system call.\n\n* Added support for version-3 tz format files.  This is needed when using\n  the tz database release 2013e or later, and affects a few unusual cases --\n  currently only TZ='America/Godthab' for time stamps after 2037.\n\n* Added new API functions pthread_getattr_default_np and\n  pthread_setattr_default_np to get and set the default pthread\n  attributes of a process.\n\n* Added support for TSX lock elision for pthread mutexes on i386 and x86-64.\n  This may improve lock scaling of existing programs on TSX capable systems.\n  When the --enable-lock-elision=yes parameter is specified at configure\n  time lock elision will be enabled by default for all PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT\n  mutexes.\n\n* Support added for AT_HWCAP2 (to coincide with Linux kernel 3.10\n  availability).  Implemented by Ryan S. Arnold.\n\n* Support added for POWER8 platform.  Implemented by Ryan S. Arnold.\n\f\nVersion 2.17\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  1349, 3439, 3479, 3665, 5044, 5246, 5298, 5400, 6530, 6677, 6778, 6808,\n  9685, 9914, 10014, 10038, 10114, 10191, 10631, 10873, 11438, 11607, 11638,\n  11741, 12140, 13013, 13412, 13542, 13601, 13603, 13604, 13629, 13679,\n  13696, 13698, 13717, 13741, 13759, 13761, 13763, 13881, 13939, 13950,\n  13952, 13966, 14042, 14047, 14090, 14150, 14151, 14152, 14154, 14157,\n  14166, 14173, 14195, 14197, 14237, 14246, 14251, 14252, 14283, 14298,\n  14303, 14307, 14328, 14331, 14336, 14337, 14347, 14349, 14368, 14376,\n  14417, 14447, 14459, 14476, 14477, 14501, 14505, 14510, 14516, 14518,\n  14519, 14530, 14532, 14538, 14543, 14544, 14545, 14557, 14562, 14568,\n  14576, 14579, 14583, 14587, 14595, 14602, 14610, 14621, 14638, 14645,\n  14648, 14652, 14660, 14661, 14669, 14672, 14683, 14694, 14716, 14719,\n  14743, 14767, 14783, 14784, 14785, 14793, 14796, 14797, 14801, 14803,\n  14805, 14807, 14811, 14815, 14821, 14822, 14824, 14828, 14831, 14833,\n  14835, 14838, 14856, 14863, 14865, 14866, 14868, 14869, 14871, 14872,\n  14879, 14889, 14893, 14898, 14914.\n\n* Optimization of memcpy for MIPS.\n\n* CVE-2011-4609 svc_run() produces high cpu usage when accept fails with\n  EMFILE has been fixed (Bugzilla #14889).\n\n* The add-on ports collection is now distributed in the \"ports\" subdirectory\n  of the main GNU C Library distribution, rather than separately.\n\n* Port to ARM AArch64 contributed by Linaro.\n\n* Support for STT_GNU_IFUNC symbols added for s390 and s390x.\n  Optimized versions of memcpy, memset, and memcmp added for System z10 and\n  zEnterprise z196.\n  Implemented by Andreas Krebbel.\n\n* The new function secure_getenv allows secure access to the environment,\n  returning NULL if running in a SUID/SGID process.  This function replaces\n  the internal function __secure_getenv.\n\n* SystemTap static probes have been added into the dynamic linker.\n  Implemented by Gary Benson.\n\n* Optimizations of string functions strstr, strcasestr and memmem.\n  Implemented by Maxim Kuvyrkov.\n\n* The minimum Linux kernel version that this version of the GNU C Library\n  can be used with is 2.6.16.\n\n* Optimizations of string functions memchr, wcschr, wcscpy, and wcsrchr for\n  powerpc POWER7.  Implemented by Will Schmidt.\n\n* New configure option --disable-nscd builds the C library such that it\n  never attempts to contact the Name Service Caching Daemon (nscd).\n  New configure option --disable-build-nscd avoids building nscd itself;\n  this is the default if --disable-nscd is used.\n\n* Improved support for cross-compilation, including cross-testing and\n  bootstrap builds without a previously built glibc.\n\n* Several testsuite tests are now able to test multiple IFUNC variants of an\n  interface, rather than just testing the one that would be chooen by\n  default.\n\n* New configure options --with-bugurl and --with-pkgversion, for\n  distributors to use to embed their bug-reporting and package version\n  information in --help and --version output.\n\n* The ttyname and ttyname_r functions on Linux now fall back to searching for\n  the tty file descriptor in /dev/pts or /dev if /proc is not available.  This\n  allows creation of chroots without the procfs mounted on /proc.\n\n* The `crypt' function now fails if passed salt bytes that violate the\n  specification for those values.  On Linux, the `crypt' function will\n  consult /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled to determine if \"FIPS mode\" is\n  enabled, and fail on encrypted strings using the MD5 or DES algorithm\n  when the mode is enabled.\n\n* The `clock_*' suite of functions (declared in <time.h>) is now available\n  directly in the main C library.  Previously it was necessary to link with\n  -lrt to use these functions.  This change has the effect that a\n  single-threaded program that uses a function such as `clock_gettime' (and\n  is not linked with -lrt) will no longer implicitly load the pthreads\n  library at runtime and so will not suffer the overheads associated with\n  multi-thread support in other code such as the C++ runtime library.\n\n* New locales: ayc_PE, doi_IN, ia_FR, mni_IN, nhn_MX, niu_NU, niu_NZ,\n  sat_IN, and szl_PL.\n\f\nVersion 2.16\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  174, 208, 350, 369, 411, 706, 766, 2074, 2541, 2547, 2548, 2550, 2551,\n  2552, 2553, 2554, 2562, 2563, 2565, 2566, 2570, 2576, 2636, 2678, 3335,\n  3440, 3748, 3768, 3866, 3868, 3906, 3976, 3992, 4026, 4108, 4596, 4822,\n  5077, 5461, 5805, 5993, 6471, 6486, 6578, 6649, 6730, 6770, 6794, 6884,\n  6890, 6894, 6895, 6907, 6911, 6959, 7064, 9739, 9902, 10110, 10135, 10140,\n  10153, 10210, 10254, 10346, 10375, 10545, 10716, 10846, 10882, 11174,\n  11261, 11322, 11365, 11451, 11494, 11521, 11677, 11837, 11959, 12047,\n  12097, 12193, 12194, 12297, 12298, 12301, 12340, 12354, 12416, 12495,\n  13058, 13223, 13361, 13525, 13526, 13527, 13528, 13529, 13530, 13531,\n  13532, 13533, 13547, 13551, 13552, 13553, 13555, 13556, 13559, 13563,\n  13566, 13576, 13579, 13583, 13592, 13594, 13613, 13618, 13637, 13656,\n  13658, 13673, 13691, 13695, 13704, 13705, 13706, 13718, 13726, 13738,\n  13739, 13743, 13750, 13758, 13760, 13761, 13775, 13786, 13787, 13792,\n  13806, 13824, 13840, 13841, 13844, 13846, 13848, 13851, 13852, 13854,\n  13871, 13872, 13873, 13879, 13882, 13883, 13884, 13885, 13886, 13892,\n  13895, 13908, 13910, 13911, 13912, 13913, 13914, 13915, 13916, 13917,\n  13918, 13919, 13920, 13921, 13922, 13923, 13924, 13926, 13927, 13928,\n  13938, 13941, 13942, 13954, 13955, 13956, 13963, 13967, 13968, 13970,\n  13973, 13979, 13983, 13986, 13996, 14012, 14027, 14033, 14034, 14036,\n  14040, 14043, 14044, 14048, 14049, 14050, 14053, 14055, 14059, 14064,\n  14075, 14080, 14083, 14103, 14104, 14109, 14112, 14117, 14122, 14123,\n  14134, 14153, 14183, 14188, 14199, 14210, 14218, 14229, 14241, 14273,\n  14277, 14278.\n\n* Support for the x32 ABI on x86-64 added.  The x32 target is selected by\n  configuring glibc with:\n\tBUILD_CC='gcc' CC='gcc -mx32' CXX='g++ -mx32'\n  Visit <http://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/> for more x32 ABI info.\n  Implemented by H.J. Lu.\n\n* ISO C11 support:\n\n  + define static_assert\n\n  + do not declare gets\n\n  + declare at_quick_exit and quick_exit also for ISO C11\n\n  + aligned_alloc.  NB: The code is deliberately allows the size parameter\n    to not be a multiple of the alignment.  This is a moronic requirement\n    in the standard but it is only a requirement on the caller, not the\n    implementation.\n\n  + timespec_get added\n\n  + uchar.h support added\n\n  + CMPLX, CMPLXF, CMPLXL added\n\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Support for the IA-64 has been moved to ports.\n\n* Remove support for anything but ELF binary format\n\n* Checking versions of poll, ppoll added.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* More generic and 64-bit performance optimizations to math functions.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* New configure option --enable-obsolete-rpc makes the deprecated RPC\n  headers and functions available at compile time as they were before\n  version 2.14.  This option will be removed at some time in the future\n  after the TI-RPC library becomes fully sufficient for the needs of\n  existing applications.\n\n* Compatibility code for Linux kernel versions before 2.4 has been removed.\n  Note that glibc is not expected to work with any Linux kernel version\n  before 2.6.\n\n* New header <sys/auxv.h> and function getauxval allowing easy access to\n  the AT_* key-value pairs passed from the Linux kernel.  The header also\n  defines the HWCAP_* bits associated with the AT_HWCAP key.\n\n* New locales: mag_IN\n\n* New configure option --enable-systemtap builds SystemTap static probes\n  into libc for setjmp and longjmp and into libpthread for various operations.\n  So far the setjmp/longjmp probes and some of the libpthread probes are\n  provided only for i*86 and x86_64.\n  Implemented by Roland McGrath and Rayson Ho.\n\n* Optimized expf for x86-32 and x86-64.

Miller.\n\n* Improved support for cross-compilation, especially bootstrap builds\n  without a previously built glibc.\n\n* Ports for the TILE-Gx and TILEPro families of processors.  Contributed by\n  Chris Metcalf from Tilera.\n\n* Support for the old ARM ABI has been removed from ports.  Only the EABI is\n  now supported for ARM processors.\n\n* The hard-float variant of the ARM EABI now uses /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3\n  as the name of the dynamic linker, to distinguish it from the\n  /lib/ld-linux.so.3 dynamic linker used for the base EABI.\n\n* Support for CRIS has been removed from ports.\n\n* A new class of installed header has been documented for low-level\n  platform-specific functionality.  PowerPC added the first instance with a\n  function to provide time base register access.  Contributed by Tulio\n  Magno Quites Machado Filho.\n\n* ix86 configurations now install header files that are consistent with\n  what x86-64 configurations install.  These same header files can be used\n  for -m32, -m64, or -mx32 builds.\n  Contributed by H.J. Lu.\n\n* Math library bug fixes.  A thorough audit of all open math library bugs was\n  conducted by Joseph Myers.  Significant progress was made on many math\n  library bugs resulting in more accurate exceptions and function results.\n  Many thanks to all those that contributed including Andreas Jaeger for his\n  patch review and work on the x87 trigonometric instruction issues.\n\n* Timezone data is no longer installed.  Timezone-related binaries and scripts\n  will continue to be installed.

Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\f\nVersion 2.5\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  39, 68, 192, 352, 388, 531, 935, 1006, 1201, 1203, 1386, 1782, 1783, 1784,\n  1785, 1786, 1787, 1951, 1974, 1996, 2072, 2098, 2125, 2134, 2158, 2182,\n  2349, 2376, 2386, 2389, 2415, 2418, 2420, 2423, 2450, 2451, 2466, 2472,\n  2473, 2477, 2498, 2499, 2501, 2502, 2505, 2507, 2508, 2509, 2517, 2526,\n  2569, 2571, 2592, 2611, 2625, 2632, 2644, 2662, 2680, 2683, 2684, 2693,\n  2695, 2703, 2734, 2751, 2764, 2766, 2775, 2792, 2821, 2823, 2832, 2841,\n  2843, 2883, 2892, 2908, 2914, 2926, 2961, 2978, 2980, 2987, 2997, 2998,\n  3013, 3018, 3034, 3040, 3044, 3123, 3124, 3137, 3138, 3143, 3155, 3189,\n  3225, 3251, 3252, 3253, 3273\n\n* For Linux, the sorting of addresses returned by getaddrinfo now also\n  handles rules 3, 4, and 7 from RFC 3484.  I.e., all rules are handled.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Allow system admin to configure getaddrinfo with the /etc/gai.conf file.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* New Linux interfaces: splice, tee, sync_file_range, vmsplice.\n\n* New iconv module for MIK.  Contributed by Alexander Shopov.\n\n* For sites with broken group and/or passwd database, the auto-propagate\n  option of nscd can prevent creating ID lookup entries from the results\n  of a name lookup and vice versa.   This usually is no problem but some\n  site might have problems with the default behavior.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Iterating over entire database in NIS can be slow.  With the\n  SETENT_BATCH_READ option in /etc/default/nss a system admin can decide\n  to trade time for memory.  The entire database will be read at once.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* The interfaces introduced in RFC 3542 have been implemented by\n  Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Support for the new ELF hash table format was added by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Support for priority inheritance mutexes added by Jakub Jelinek and\n  Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Support for priority protected mutexes added by Jakub Jelinek.\n\n* New locales: nr_ZA, pa_PK, ca_AD, ca_FR, ca_IT, el_CY, tr_CY, as_IN,\n  or_IN, csb_PL, fy_NL, sr_ME.\n\f\nVersion 2.4\n\n* More overflow detection functions.\n\n* New iconv converters for IBM1025, IBM1122, IBM1137, IBM1153,\n  IBM1154, IBM1155, IBM1156, IBM1157, and IBM1158 contributed by Jiro Sekiba.\n\n  More converters for IBM803, IBM901, IBM902, IBM921, IBM1008, IBM1097,\n  IBM1112, IBM1123, IBM1130, IBM1140, IBM1141, IBM1142, IBM1143, IBM1144,\n  IBM1145, IBM1146, IBM1147, IBM1148, IBM1149, IBM1166, IBM1167, IBM4517,\n  IBM4899, IBM4909, IBM4971, IBM5347, IBM9030, IBM9066, IBM9448, IBM12712,\n  IBM16804, IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 contributed\n  by Masahide Washizawa.\n\n* It is now possible to install audit libraries for the dynamic linker using\n  LD_AUDIT.  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* The LinuxThreads add-on, providing pthreads on Linux 2.4 kernels, is no\n  longer supported.  The new NPTL implementation requires Linux 2.6 kernels.\n  For a libc and libpthread that works well on Linux 2.4 kernels, we\n  recommend using the stable 2.3 branch.\n\n* The new function open_wmemstream acts like open_memstream,\n  but uses a wchar_t wide character buffer.\n\n* The new function ppoll is an improved version of poll, similar to pselect.\n\n* New interfaces: fdopendir, openat, fstatat, fchmodat, fchownat,\n  futimesat, faccessat, mkdirat, mkfifoat, mknodat,\n  renameat, unlinkat, linkat, symlinkat, readlinkat.\n\n* New Linux kernel system calls: unshare,\n  inotify_init, inotify_add_watch, inotify_rm_watch.\n\n* The euidaccess function is now also known by the alias eaccess,\n  for compatibility with some other systems.\n\n* Timezone data updated to 2006b version.\n\f\nVersion 2.3.6\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  38, 253, 549, 622, 653, 721, 758, 851, 877, 915, 934, 955, 961,\n  1016, 1037, 1076, 1079, 1080, 1081, 1082, 1083, 1084, 1085, 1086,\n  1087, 1088, 1090, 1091, 1092, 1093, 1094, 1095, 1096, 1097, 1098,\n  1099, 1100, 1101, 1102, 1103, 1104, 1105, 1106, 1107, 1108, 1109,\n  1110, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1125, 1137, 1138, 1249, 1250, 1251, 1252,\n  1253, 1254, 1350, 1358, 1394, 1438, 1498, 1534\n\n  Visit <http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/> for the details of each bug.\n\n* As of this release, GCC 4 can be used to compile the C Library.\n\n* Timezone data updated to 2005m version.\n\f\nVersion 2.3.5\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  284, 592, 602, 626, 633, 640, 650, 661, 671, 681, 693, 700, 710, 719,\n  722, 723, 725, 726, 727, 728, 729, 730, 731, 732, 733, 734, 735, 736,\n  737, 738, 739, 740, 741, 742, 743, 744, 745, 765, 767, 768, 769, 776,\n  777, 787, 821, 822, 823, 825\n\n  Visit <http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/> for the details of each bug.\n\f\nVersion 2.3.4\n\n* Support for RFC 3678.  Real implementations exist only for Linux so far.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* nscd can now cache entries persistently.  Expiring entries are reloaded.\n  For speedups the cache can be shared in memory with client processes.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* nscd can now perform SELinux checks.\n  Implemented by Matthew Rickard <mjricka@epoch.ncsc.mil>.\n\n* getaddrinfo queries are now cached.  Canonical name lookup is performed\n  efficiently.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* The nothrow function attribute is used when headers are used by gcc when\n  compiling C code.  This can avoid significant amounts of exception\n  handling data.\n\n* The malloc functions perform more error checking and are stricter when\n  it comes to reacting on errors.  The default action is to terminate\n  the process after showing an error message.  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Reverse lookups of IPv6 addresses does not use bit string or .ip6.int\n  lookups anymore unless explicitly requested.  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Namespaces in ld.so are implemented.  DSOs can be loaded in separate\n  namespaces using the new function dlmopen().  This feature is of course,\n  like most other dynamic loading functionality, not available in statically\n  linked applications.  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Low-overhead boundary checking variants of string and some stdio functions\n  were added.  These are to be used in conjunction with a gcc patch by\n  Jakub Jelinek which adds calls to these functions if possible.\n  Implemented by Jakub Jelinek and Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Old code for several operating systems and machine architectures that\n  have not been in working condition in a long time have been removed from\n  the main source tree maintained by the GNU C Library's maintainers.\n  These files are now reside in the separate `ports' source module\n  that is usable as an add-on when building the library.\n\f\nVersion 2.3.3\n\n* New functions `dladdr1' and `dlinfo' in <dlfcn.h> provide more ways to\n  interrogate the dynamic linker, compatible with the Solaris interface.\n\n* ELF thread-local storage support (TLS) now works on PowerPC and PowerPC64;\n  implemented by Paul Mackerras, Steven Munroe, and Roland McGrath.\n\n* getifaddrs now uses the netlink interface on Linux to get its information.\n  Implemented by Thorsten Kukuk.\n\n* getaddrinfo now implements AI_V4MAPPED, AI_ALL, and AI_ADDRCONF.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* support for non-executable stacks on x86 has been added.  Changes mostly\n  by Roland McGrath.\n\n* regex is now much faster for multibyte locales.  Changes by Jakub Jelinek\n  and Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* getaddrinfo now performs destination address selection according to\n  RFC 3484.\n\f\nVersion 2.3.2\n\n* Thread-safe interfaces for many functions that access locale data\n  were added in version 2.3, but these features were omitted from NEWS.\n  Many functions have variants with an `_l' suffix that take a `locale_t'\n  object as a parameter rather than consulting the current locale.\n  The new functions `newlocale', `duplocale', and `freelocale' in <locale.h>\n  create and maintain `locale_t' objects.  Additionally, the new function\n  `uselocale' sets \"the current locale\" (as used by functions not so\n  parameterized) set for an individual thread.  These features were added\n  in version 2.3, implemented by Ulrich Drepper and Roland McGrath.\n\n* The functions getresuid, getresgid, setresuid, and setresgid, which\n  have long been available on Linux, are now declared in <unistd.h>\n  and are now also available on the Hurd.\n\n* ELF thread-local storage support (TLS) now works on x86-64.\n\n* The new dynamic string token $LIB is expanded in shared library names.\n  This normally expands to lib, but on some 64-bit platforms to lib64 instead.\n\n* Aldy Hernandez contributed complete software floating point support for\n  PowerPC machines with no FPU.\n\n* fexecve is implemented on Linux.\n\n* The `btowc' function should work at least twice as fast due to\n  specialized callbacks in the iconv modules.  Implemented by Bruno Haible.\n\n* With approriate thread add-ons cancelable functions are now implemented\n  in libc.so as well.  No need to call the function in libpthread.  This\n  change allowed to finally disable the incorrect and expensive handling\n  of weak definition in ld.so.\n\n* Yet more PLT entries in libc.so have been removed.  We finally arrived\n  at the bare minimum.  Startup times improved appropriately.\n\n* Support for the new Linux/x86 system call interface was added.  The\n  AT_SYSINFO auxiliary vector entry is recognized and handled.\n\f\nVersion 2.3\n\n* Masahide Washizawa contributed iconv modules for IBM1163 and IBM1164\n  charsets.\n\n* iconv (the program and the interface) now accepts empty names (excluding\n  options like //TRANSLIT) to mean \"use charset of current locale\".\n\n* localedef can now transliterate characters in strings which are not in\n  the provided charmap.  The information from the input locale is used.\n\n* Prelinking support was added for ELF targets.  This requires additional\n  tools and recent versions of the GNU binutils.  Contributed by Jakub Jelinek.\n\n* Read-only stdio streams now use mmap to speed up operation by eliminating\n  copying and buffer underflows.  To use add 'm' to the mode string of\n  the fopen/fdopen/freopen call.  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* The malloc functions were completely rewritten by Wolfram Gloger based\n  on Doug Lea's malloc-2.7.0.c.\n\n* Isamu Hasegawa contributed a completely new and POSIX-conformant\n  implementation of regex.\n\n* Bruno Haible upgraded the iconv and locale implementation to support\n  Unicode 3.2.\n\n* Contents of the LC_* and LANG environment variables in the CEN style are\n  not recognized anymore.   It never was used.  Change by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* The runtime (ld.so, libc, libpthread for Linux) now can handle the ELF\n  thread-local storage (TLS) ABI on some platforms.\n  Changes by Ulrich Drepper.  SH support by Kaz Kojima.\n\n* Bruno Haible contributed iconv converters for ISO-2022-JP-3, SHIFT JIS-X0213,\n  EUC-JISX0213, and TSCII.\n\n* New header <ifaddrs.h> with functions `getifaddrs' and `freeifaddrs':\n  BSD-compatible interface for getting all network interface addresses.\n  Implementation for IPv4 by Roland McGrath.\n\n* Loading of locale data is faster due to the introduction of a locale\n  archive.  Implemented by Roland McGrath and Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Startup times are significantly reduced by not using exported functions\n  inside the library itself.  Changes by Jakub Jelinek, Roland McGrath,\n  and Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Steven Munroe contributed a port to PowerPC64/Linux.\n\f\nVersion 2.2.6\n\n* The Hurd now uses the GNU libio implementation of stdio rather than the\n  old GNU stdio implementation, and uses a new ABI (libc.so.0.3).\n\n* The Hurd on x86 now has the `ioperm' function and <sys/io.h> header file\n  with the same behavior as the Linux system call of the same name.\n\f\nVersion 2.2.5\n\n* Stephen Moshier implemented log2, log10, powl and cbrtl for the\n  128-bit long double format.\n\n* Masahide Washizawa contributed iconv modules for IBM1132, IBM1133, IBM1160,\n  IBM1161, and IBM1162 charsets.\n\n* Andreas Jaeger contributed a port to x86-64/Linux.\n\n* Peter Bruin contributed a port to PowerPC/Hurd.\n\n* libc functions using I/O streams now can handle wide-oriented streams\n  as well.\n\n* optimizations in the dynamic linker.  Binaries created by recent binutils\n  versions start up quicker due to reduced time spent on relocations.\n\n* Support for use of gcc3 added by Jakub Jelinek and HJ Lu.\n\f\nVersion 2.2.4\n\n* Stephen Moshier implemented cosh, expm1, log1p, acos, sinh, tanh,\n  asinh, atanh, j0 for the 128-bit long double format.\n\n* Bruno Haible updated all the code handling Unicode in some form to\n  support Unicode 3.1.\n\n* Speed of regex for single-byte locales is back to previous levels.\n  Patch by Isamu Hasegawa.\n\n* Alpha, SPARC, and IA-64 now also using floating stacks.\n\n* Startup time of internationalized applications greatly improved through\n  iconv cache.  Use iconvconfig to generate the cache file.\n  Contributed by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* The IA-64 specific part of ld.so was rewritten to eliminate some pretty\n  severe performance problems.  Patch by David Mosberger.\n\n* The Hurd port got a lot more functionality like AIO, various stdio\n  extensions, etc.  Mainly done by Roland McGrath.\n\n* mtrace can now lookup symbols in shared libraries.\n\f\nVersion 2.2.3\n\n* Intel's IA-64 math library is largely integrated.  It provides fast and\n  accurate implementatations for most basic and standard math functions\n  in float, double, and long double format.\n\n* Stephen Moshier implemented j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn, lgamma, erf, erfc,\n  and asin for the 96-bit long double format and asin, log, tan for the\n  128-bit long double format.\n\n* The beginning of a last-bit accurate math library by IBM Haifa were added.\n  The basic double functions exist today.  Contributed by Abraham Ziv\n  <ziv@il.ibm.com>, Moshe Olshansky <olshansk@il.ibm.com>, Ealan Henis\n  <ealan@il.ibm.com>, and Anna Reitman <reitman@il.ibm.com>.\n\n* An asynchronous name lookup library was added.  The interface is designed\n  after POSIX AIO.  The proposal was circulated beforehand to get comments.\n  No negative ones came in.  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Port to S390/64bit contributed by Martin Schwidefsky\n  <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>.\n\n* David Mosberger <davidm@hpl.hp.com> implemented the setcontext family\n  of functions for Linux/IA-64.\n\n* The RPC code is now thread safe.  Threads can now use the same service\n  of different services at the same time.  Patch by Eric Norum\n  <eric.norum@usask.ca> with some help by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com> implemented the setcontext\n  family of functions for Linux/S390.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper <drepper@redhat.com> implemented the setcontext family\n  of functions for Linux/x86.\n\n* Port to Linux/CRIS contributed by Axis Communications.\n\f\nVersion 2.2.2\n\n* Lots of headers were cleaned up.  Using the tool in the conform/ subdir\n  we can now check for namespace violations and missing declarations.  The\n  result is that almost all headers are now Unix-compliant (as defined in\n  the upcoming XPG6).  The negative side is that some programs might need\n  corrections, too, if they depend on the incorrect form of the headers in\n  previous versions which defined too many symbols and included too many\n  other headers.\n\n* regex now handles multibyte character sets correctly.\n  Contributed by Isamu Hasegawa <isamu@yamato.ibm.com>.\n\n* iconv (the program) does now conform to the upcoming XPG6 and handles\n  charmaps.  Instead of the charset names the path of charmaps can be\n  provided and the conversion happens based on this data.\n  Contributed by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* The locale program now provides detailed information about the installed\n  locales.  While\n\n    locale -a\n\n  only lists the names of the supported locales\n\n    locale -a --verbose\n\n  provides details such as country, language, and codeset name.\n  Contributed by Ulrich Drepper.\n\f\nVersion 2.2.1\n\n* The gencat program now parses the input file according to the charset\n  selected by the LC_CTYPE category.  This is important for stateful\n  character sets.  To make generating catalogs easier there is a way\n  to overwrite the charset selected by the locale: before the first\n  message or $ quote line the catalog can contain a line like\n\n    $ codeset=ISO-8859-2\n\n  to select the charset (ISO-8859-2 in this case).\n\n  Implemented by Shinya Hanataka and Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* New codeset conversion modules: IBM-922  (Estonia PC codeset),\n  IBM-1124 (Ukraine PC codeset), IBM-1129 (Vietnamese PC codeset).\n  Contributed by Masahide Washizawa <washi@jp.ibm.com>.\n\n* Optimized string functions for Alpha ev6 and ev67 by Richard Henderson\n  <rth@redhat.com> and Rick Gorton <rick.gorton@alpha-processor.com>.\n\n* The LANGUAGE environment variable is now ignored unless the locale is\n  changed from the default \"C\" locale.\n\n* The usual bug fixes.\n\f\nVersion 2.2\n\n* Greg McGary added runtime support for bounds checking using gcc's\n  new -fbounded-pointers option.  ix86 target is complete.  PowerPC\n  is in progress.\n\n* Thorsten Kukuk added secure mode support to nscd.\n\n* The Berkeley db libraries have been removed.\n\n  Related, the nss_db module is now in a separate package since it\n  obviously requires a database library being available.\n\n* Wide character I/O streams implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Functions from the extended socket API added by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Functions feenableexcept and fedisableexcept to control the\n  behaviour of individual exceptions have been added by Andreas Jaeger.\n\n* ldconfig program added by Andreas Jaeger and Jakub Jelinek.\n\n* The resolver code has been updated from bind 8.2.3-T5B which supports\n  threads.  The integration was done by Andreas Jaeger, Adam D. Bradley,\n  and Mark Kettenis.\n\n  This change could in some situations effect backward compatibility.  Since\n  now `_res' is a thread-local instead of a global variable, modifying it\n  in one thread does not have any effect in other threads.\n\n  The resolver library was also extended to allow IPv6 as the transport\n  protocol for the requests.  This work was done by Stig Venaas.\n\n* Compatibility code for K&R C compilers has been removed from the\n  header files.  A ISO C compiler is needed to use the library\n  (conforming to either C89 or C99 standard).\n\n* Complete rewrite of the localedef program to support multibyte character\n  sets.  Implement handling of ISO 14651 and ISO 14652.  Rewrite strcoll,\n  strxfrm, wcscoll, and wcsxfrm functions.  Make isw*() functions work.\n  Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n  Bruno Haible significantly improved the generation and use of the data\n  structures for the wide character tables.\n\n* Plural handling in gettext implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* The utmp daemon has been removed.\n\n* The port to MIPS-Linux has been finished by Andreas Jaeger.\n\n* A port to Hitachi SH3 and SH4 has been contributed by Kazumoto Kojima\n  and Yutaka Niibe.\n\n* POSIX clocks and timers implemented by Kaz Kylheku and Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* POSIX barriers implemented by Kaz Kylheku.\n\n* POSIX spawn function family implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* POSIX spinlocks are now available.\n\n* Timed wait functions for mutex, rwlock, and semaphores are implemented.\n\n* the configure option --enable-kernel=X.Y.Z allows to strip out\n  compatibility for kernel versions before X.Y.Z.  This is currently only\n  implemented for Linux.\n\n* the sockaddr_in6 structure changed.  The IPv6 working group added a new\n  field sin6_scope_id.  This means that all programs using IPv6 should be\n  recompiled.  Don't expect binary compatibility with previous glibc\n  versions.\n\n* various conversion modules for IBM character sets contributed by\n  Masahide Washizawa.\n\n* IA-64 port by Jes Sorensen and HJ Lu.\n\f\nVersion 2.1.3\n\n* bug fixes\n\n\f\nVersion 2.1.2\n\n* bug fixes\n\n\f\nVersion 2.1.1\n\n* New ISO C 9x function _Exit, imaxabs, and imaxdiv are added.\n\n* New xdr functions are added; some rpc functions are now 64bit clean.\n\n* Fixed a number of bugs and memory leaks (especially in NIS+ code).\n\n* Fixed known incompatibilities with glibc 2.0.\n\n* New functions lock64, strchrnul, rawmemchr, getutmp and getutmpx.\n\n* Optimized a number of functions (especially the ELF dynamic loader).\n\n* Update timezone data files.\n\n* lots of charmaps corrections\n\n* some new locale definitions and charmaps\n\n\f\nVersion 2.1\n\n* Richard Henderson corrected size of struct timeval on Linux/Alpha to\n  conform to POSIX member type requirements.  Symbol versions have been\n  adjusted as needed within the library, and for direct use by applications,\n  but there is potential for problems if third-party libraries use\n  struct timeval as part of their interface.  This does not present\n  a problem for X and other \"essential\" system libraries.\n\n* An additional locale model to support C++ Standard Library locale\n  model and probably more was implemented by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Eric Youngdale and Ulrich Drepper implemented versioning of objects on\n  symbol level.\n\n* Miles Bader provided the `argp' function family to support hierachical\n  command line argument parsing, layered on top of getopt.\n\n* strtod accepts new hexadecimal floating-point format from ISO C 9X.\n\n* printf has two new specifiers %a and %A to print hexadecimal flaoting-point\n  numbers.\n\n* scanf recognizes the %a and %A format for scanning floating point numbers.\n\n* the new headers <stdint.h> and <inttypes.h> from ISO C 9X provides\n  information and interfaces for the available integer types.\n\n* about 130 new math functions were added to implement the ISO C9x math\n  library.\n\n* the new header <complex.h> contains definitions of the complex math\n  functions from ISO C 9X.\n\n* the new header <tgmath.h> defines generic macros to use complex or\n  real valued functions.\n\n* Thorsten Kukuk provided an implementation for NIS+, securelevel 0, 1 and 2.\n\n* Andreas Jaeger provided a test suite for the math library.\n\n* Mark Kettenis implemented the utmpx interface and an utmp daemon.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper added character set conversion functions (iconv).\n\n* Optimized string functions have been added.\n\n* The localedata addon is now part of glibc.\n\n* An implementation of profiling shared libraries was added by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* Thorsten Kukuk and Ulrich Drepper provided an implementation for a caching\n  daemon for NSS (nscd).\n\n  Missing a better place here are some numbers on improvements.  Under\n  Linux 2.1.125 un-tar-ing the kernel sources takes\n\n\t\t\t\t  user\tsystem\t   wall\n\n    using local files\t\t12.19s\t 6.88s\t 22.91s\n\n    using NIS\t\t\t13.92s\t 8.91s\t 26.34s\n\n

29.60s\n\n  Keep in mind that non-namelookup related operations dominate above times.\n  It was just a common complain that using NIS+ unpacking the kernel is\n  horribly slow.\n\n  [1] The old nscd implementation is not available anymore since it was\n  distributed with glibc up to version 2.0.98 and thus is now replaced.\n\n* Tim Waugh provided an implementation of the POSIX.2 wordexp function family.\n\n* Mark Kettenis provided a Hesiod NSS module.\n\n* The ELF dynamic loader knows how to process dynamic string tokens ($ORIGIN\n  and $PLATFORM) in RPATHs and similar strings (Ulrich Drepper).\n\n* rcmd can now handle netgroups (Dick Streefland).\n\n* A port to the ARM was contributed by Phil Blundell, Pat Beirne and Scott\n  Bambrough.\n\n* Support for the IPv6 protocol has been added to the socket API, as per the\n  latest draft standards.\n\n* Support for Linux 2.2 has been added.\n\n* Interface changes relative to the latest 2.0.x

functions\n\f\nVersion 2.0.1\n\n* fixed lots of header problems (especially Linux/GNU specific)\n\n* dynamic loader preserves all registers\n\n* Roland McGrath provided support for handling of auxiliary objects in\n  the ELF dynamic loader.\n\n* support for parallel builds is improved\n\f\nVersion 2.0\n\n* GNU extensions are no longer declared by default.  To enable them you\n  must define the macro `_GNU_SOURCE' in your program or compile with\n  `-D_GNU_SOURCE'.\n\n* The library has changed from using GNU ld symbol aliases to using weak\n  symbols where available.  The ELF object file format supports weak\n  symbols; GNU ld also supports weak symbols in the a.out format.  (There\n  is also now support for other GNU ld extensions in ELF.  Use the\n  `--with-elf' option to configure to indicate you have ELF, and\n  `--with-gnu-ld' if using GNU ld.)  This change resulted in the deletion\n  of many files which contained only symbol aliases, reducing the size of\n  the source and the compiled library; many other files were renamed to\n  less cryptic names previously occupied by the symbol alias files.\n  There is a new header file <elf.h> for programs which operate on\n  files in the ELF format.\n\n* Converted to Autoconf version 2, so `configure' has more options.\n  Run `configure --help' to see the details.\n\n* The library can now be configured to build profiling, highly-optimized\n  (but undebuggable), and/or shared libraries (ELF with GNU ld only).  The\n  `--enable-profile', `--enable-omitfp', and `--enable-shared' options to\n  `configure' enable building these extra libraries.  The shared library is\n  built by default when using both ELF and GNU ld.  When shared libraries\n  are enabled, the new library `-ldl' is available for arbitrary run-time\n  loading of shared objects; its interface is defined in <dlfcn.h>.  The\n  new header file <link.h> gives access to the internals of the run-time\n  dynamic linker, `ld.so'.  The shell script `ldd' is similar to the\n  application of same name on other systems and it provides information\n  about dynamically linked binaries.\n\n* The C library now provides the run-time support code for profiling\n  executables compiled with `-pg'.  Programs can control the profiling code\n  through the interface in <sys/gmon.h>.  The `gmon.out' files written by\n  the GNU C library can be read only by GNU `gprof' (from GNU binutils);\n  the support for this file format was contributed by David Mosberger-Tang.\n\n* The math code has been replaced with a math library based on fdlibm from\n  Sun, and modified by JT Conklin and Ulrich Drepper with i387 support, by\n  Ian Taylor with `float' functions and by Ulrich Drepper with `long double'\n  functions.  The math functions now reside in a separate library,  so\n  programs using them will need to use `-lm' their linking commands.\n\n* John C. Bowman contributed optimized ix87 assembler inline functions.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper has contributed support for an `/etc/nsswitch.conf'\n  mechanism similar to that found in Solaris 2.  This is now used for the\n  group, passwd, hosts, networks, services, protocols, rpc, ethers,\n  shadow, netgroup, publickey, and alias databases.  The `nsswitch.conf'\n  file controls what services are used for each individual database.  This\n  works by loading shared libraries with names specified in `nsswitch.conf',\n  so service modules can be changed or added at any time without even\n  relinking any program.  Currently there are the file, db, and NIS based\n  NSS services available.\n\n* The new functions `strtoq' and `strtouq' parse integer values from\n  strings, like `strtol' and `strtoul', but they return `long long int' and\n  `unsigned long long int' values, respectively (64-bit quantities).\n\n* The new functions `strtof' and `strtold' parse floating-point values from\n  strings, like `strtod', but they return `float' and `long double' values,\n  respectively (on some machines `double' and `long double' are the same).\n\n* Ulrich Drepper has contributed new implementations of the floating-point\n  printing and reading code used in the `printf' family of functions and\n  `strtod', `strtof', and `strtold'.  These new functions are perfectly\n  accurate, and much faster than the old ones.\n\n* The implementation of the POSIX locale model was completely rewritten by\n  Ulrich Drepper.  This includes the new programs `localedef' and `locale'\n  to compile the POSIX locale definition.\n\n* The former dummy implementations of the strcoll and strxfrm function are\n  now replaced by fully functional code contributed by Ulrich Drepper.  The\n  collation information comes from the POSIX locale definitions.\n\n* The new header <langinfo.h> defines an interface for accessing\n  various locale-dependent data (using the locale chosen with `setlocale').\n\n* Ulrich Drepper has contributed a new suite of functions for operation on\n  wide-character and multibyte-character strings, in <wchar.h>;\n  and classification and case conversion of wide characters, in <wctype.h>.\n  These new functions are conforming to the ISO C, Amendement 1 specification.\n\n* There is now a second implementation of the standard I/O library available.\n  It comes from GNU libg++ as was written by Per Bothner, heavily modified\n  by Hongjiu Lu and made thread safe by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* You can now use positional parameter specifications in format strings\n  for the `printf' and `scanf' families of functions.  For example,\n  `printf (\"Number %2$d, Mr %1$s\\n\", \"Jones\", 6);'' prints\n  ``Number 6, Mr Jones''.  This is mainly useful when providing different\n  format strings for different languages, whose grammars may dictate\n  different orderings of the values being printed.  To support this\n  feature, the interface for `register_printf_handler' has changed; see\n  the header file <printf.h> for details.\n\n* The `printf' and `scanf' families of functions now understand a new\n  formatting flag for numeric conversions: the ' flag (e.g. %'d or %'f) says\n  to group numbers as indicated by the locale; for `scanf' and friends, this\n  says to accept as valid only a number with all the proper grouping\n  separators in the right places.  In the default \"C\" locale, numbers are\n  not grouped; but locales for specific countries will define the usual\n  conventions (i.e. separate thousands with `,' in the US locale).\n\n* The pgrp functions have been regularized, slightly incompatibly but much\n  less confusingly.  The core functions are now `getpgid' and `setpgid',\n  which take arguments for the PID to operate on; the POSIX.1 `getpgrp' (no\n  argument) and BSD `setpgrp' (identical to `setpgid') functions are\n  provided for compatibility.  There is no longer an incompatible `getpgrp'\n  with an argument declared under _BSD_SOURCE; no BSD code uses it.\n\n* The new header file <fts.h> and suite of functions simplify programs that\n  operate on directory trees.  This code comes from 4.4 BSD.\n\n* The resolver code has been updated from the BIND 4.9.5-P1 release.\n  Parts of the code were heavily modified by Ulrich Drepper to fit in the\n  NSS scheme used in glibc.\n\n* There is a new malloc debugging hook `__memalign_hook'.\n\n* There are new typedefs `ushort' for `unsigned short int' and `uint' for\n  `unsigned int' in <sys/types.h>.  These are for compatibility only and\n  their use is discouraged.\n\n* The `-lmcheck' library to enable standard malloc debugging hooks is now\n  done differently, so that it works even without GNU ld.\n\n* New function `euidaccess' checks allowed access to a file like `access',\n  but using the effective IDs instead of the real IDs.\n\n* The time zone data files have been updated for the latest and greatest\n  local time conventions of the countries of the world.\n\n* The new function `dirfd' extracts the file descriptor used by a DIR stream;\n  see <dirent.h>.\n\n* The new functions `ecvt', `fcvt', and `gcvt' provide an obsolete interface\n  for formatting floating-point numbers.  They are provided only for\n  compatibility; new programs should use `sprintf' instead.  There are\n  also equivalent function for the `long double' floating-point type and\n  all functions also exist in a reentrant form.\n\n* The new auxiliary library `-lutil' from 4.4 BSD contains various\n  functions for maintaining the login-record files (primarily of use to\n  system programs such as `login'), and convenient functions for\n  allocating and initializing a pseudo-terminal (pty) device.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper has contributed new support for System V style\n  shared memory and IPC on systems that support it.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper has contributed several miscellaneous new functions found\n  in System V: The `hsearch' family of functions provide an effective\n  implementation of hash tables; `a64l' and `l64a' provide a very simple\n  binary to ASCII mapping; `drand48' and friends provide a 48-bit random\n  number generator.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper has contributed new reentrant counterparts for the\n  `random' and `hsearch' families of functions; `random_r', `hsearch_r', etc.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper has contributed new, highly-optimized versions of several\n  string functions for the i486/Pentium family of processors.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper has updated the Linux-specific code, based largely\n  on work done in Hongjiu Lu's version of GNU libc for Linux.\n  The GNU library now supports Linux versions 2.0.10 and later,\n  using the ELF object file format (i[3456]86-*-linux).\n\n* Andreas Schwab has ported the C library to Linux/m68k (m68k-*-linux).\n\n* David Mosberger-Tang and Richard Henderson have ported the C library\n  to Linux/Alpha (alpha-*-linux).  Richard Henderson contributed the\n  dynamic linking support for ELF/Alpha.\n\n* Richard Henderson contributed several Alpha optimized assembler function\n  for arithmetic and string handling.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper has contributed a new set of message catalog functions to\n  support multiple languages using the <libintl.h> interface, for use with\n  his new package GNU gettext.  Translation volunteers have contributed\n  catalogs of the library's messages in Spanish, German, and Korean.\n\n* For compatibility with XPG4, Ulrich Drepper has contributed the `gencat'\n  program and the `catgets' function for reading the catalog files it\n  creates.  (The <libintl.h> interface is preferred; we include the\n  <nl_types.h> interface using `catgets' only for source compatibility with\n  programs already written to use it.)\n\n* New header file <values.h> gives SVID-compatible names for <limits.h>\n  constants.\n\n* Various new macros, declarations, and small header files for compatibility\n  with 4.4 BSD.\n\n* New function `group_member' is a convenient way to check if a process has\n  a given effective group ID.\n\n* When using GCC 2.7 and later, the socket functions are now declared in a\n  special way so that passing an argument of type `struct sockaddr_in *',\n  `struct sockaddr_ns *', or `struct sockaddr_un *' instead of the generic\n  `struct sockaddr *' type, does not generate a type-clash warning.\n\n* New function `error' declared in header file <error.h> is a convenient\n  function for printing error messages and optionally exiting; this is the\n  canonical function used in GNU programs.  The new functions `err', `warn',\n  and friends in header file <err.h> are the canonical 4.4 BSD interface for\n  doing the same thing.\n\n* The <glob.h> interface has several new flags from 4.4 BSD that extend the\n  POSIX.2 `glob' function to do ~ and {...} expansion.\n\n* New function `unsetenv' complements `setenv' for compatibility with 4.4 BSD.\n  `clearenv' which is used in POSIX.9 is also available.\n\n* New function `getsid' returns session ID number on systems that support it.\n\n* We have incorporated the 4.4 BSD `db' library (version 1.85).  New header\n  files <db.h> and <mpool.h> provide a rich set of functions for several\n  types of simple databases stored in memory and in files, and <ndbm.h> is\n  an old `ndbm'-compatible interface using the `db' functions.  Link with\n  `-ldb' to get these functions.\n\n* New macro `strdupa' copies a string like `strdup', but uses local stack\n  space from `alloca' instead of dynamic heap space from `malloc'.\n\n* New function `strnlen' is like `strlen' but searches only a given maximum\n  number of characters for the null terminator.  `stpncpy', `strndup' and\n  `strndupa' are similar variants for the `stpcpy', `strdup' and `strdupa'\n  function.\n\n* New function `statfs' in header <sys/statfs.h>.\n\n* The new <argz.h> and <envz.h> interfaces contributed by Miles Bader\n  provide convenient functions for operating on blocks of null-terminated\n  strings.\n\n* A new suite of functions in <utmp.h> handle all the details of reading\n  and writing the utmp file.\n\n* An implementation of the NIS/YP(tm) based NSS service was contributed by\n  Thorsten Kukuk.\n\n* Paul Eggert and Ulrich Drepper modified the `strftime' function to be\n  completely POSIX compliant and also implemented the extended functionality\n  to handle alternate digit representation and alternate era date formats.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper provided an implementation of the `strptime' function\n  defined in XPG4.2 which transforms a string into a `struct tm' value.\n\n* Paul Eggert provided the tzselect shell script as part of the timezone\n  code.  The shell script makes it easy to select the correct timezone\n  specification.\n\n* The implementation of the malloc family of functions is completely replaced\n  by a new implementation by Doug Lea with many improvements by Wolfram Gloger.\n  The implementation uses the mmap function (if available) and it is\n  optimized for the use in multi threaded programs.\n\n* Ulrich Drepper contributed a MD5 \"encryption\" for the crypt family of\n  functions.  This new functionality is usable by specifying a special\n  salt string and it is compatible with implementation on *BSD systems.\n\n* Lots of functions from the XPG4.2 standard were added by Ulrich Drepper:\n  `getsubopt' to handle second level command line options, `bsd_signal'\n  to access BSD style `signal' functionality, the obsolete `regexp' style\n  expression matcher.\n\n* the `lchown' function is available on system which support this\n  functionality.\n\n* The implementation of the shadow password handling function was contributed\n  by Ulrich Drepper.\n\n* David Mosberger-Tang changed the SunRPC implementation to be 64bit safe.\n\n* POSIX.1g support was added.  The <sys/select.h> header is available,\n  `isfdtype' and `pselect' are implemented.  Craig Metz contributed an\n  implementation of `getaddrinfo'.\n\f\nVersion 1.09\n\n* For cross-compilation you should now set `BUILD_CC' instead of `HOST_CC'.\n\n* New header file <fstab.h> and new functions `getfsspec', `getfsent' and\n  friends, for parsing /etc/fstab.  This code comes from 4.4 BSD.\n\n* The new function `daemon' from 4.4 BSD is useful for server programs that\n  want to put themselves in the background.\n\n* Joel Sherrill has contributed support for several standalone boards that\n  run without an operating system.\n\n* `printf', `scanf' and friends now accept a `q' type modifier for long\n  long int as well as `ll'.  Formats using these might be `%qu' or `%lld'.\n\n* All of the code taken from BSD (notably most of the math and networking\n  routines) has been updated from the BSD 4.4-Lite release.\n\n* The resolver code has been updated from the BIND-4.9.3-BETA9 release.\n\n* The new functions `getdomainname' and `setdomainname' fetch or change the\n  YP/NIS domain name.  These are system calls which exist on systems which\n  have YP (aka NIS).\n\n* The time zone data files have been updated for the latest international\n  conventions.\n\n* The SunRPC programs `portmap' and `rpcinfo' are now installed in\n  $(sbindir) (usually /usr/local/sbin) instead of $(bindir).\n\f\nVersion 1.08\n\n* The C library now includes support for Sun RPC, from Sun's free\n  RPCSRC-4.0 distribution.  The `portmap', `rpcinfo', and `rpcgen' programs\n  are included.  (There is still no support for YP.)\n\n* Tom Quinn has contributed a port of the C library to SGI machines running\n  Irix 4 (mips-sgi-irix4).\n\n* The new `lockf' function is a simplified interface to the locking\n  facilities of `fcntl', included for compatibility.\n\n* New time functions `timegm', `timelocal', and `dysize' for compatibility.\n\n* New header file <sys/timeb.h> and new function `ftime' for compatibility.\n\n* New header files <poll.h> and <sys/poll.h> and new function `poll' for\n  compatibility.\n\n* The error message printed by `assert' for a failed assertion now includes\n  the name of the program (if using GNU ld) and the name of the calling\n  function (with versions of GCC that support this).\n\n* The `psignal' function is now declared in <signal.h>, not <stdio.h>.\n\n* The library now includes the <sys/mman.h> header file and memory\n  management functions `mmap', `munmap', `mprotect', `msync', and\n  `madvise', on systems that support those facilities.\n\n* The interface for `mcheck' has changed slightly: the function called to\n  abort the program when an allocation inconsistency is detected now takes\n  an argument that indicates the type of failure.  The new function\n  `mprobe' lets you request a consistency check for a particular block at\n  any time (checks are normally done only when you call `free' or `realloc'\n  on a block).\n\n* It is now possible to easily cross-compile the C library, building on one\n  system a library to run on another machine and/or operating system.  All\n  you need to do is set the variable `HOST_CC' in `configparms' to the\n  native compiler for programs to run on the machine you are building on (a\n  few generator programs are used on Unix systems); set `CC' to the\n  cross-compiler.\n\n* The new function `fexecve' (only implemented on the GNU system) executes\n  a program file given a file descriptor already open on the file.\n\f\nVersion 1.07\n\n* Brendan Kehoe has contributed most of a port to the DEC Alpha\n  running OSF/1 (alpha-dec-osf1).  He says it is 75% complete.\n\n* You can set the variable `libprefix' in `configparms' to specify a prefix\n  to be prepended to installed library files; this makes it easy to install\n  the GNU C library to be linked as `-lgnuc' or whatever.\n\n* The new `stpncpy' is a cross between `stpcpy' and `strncpy': It\n  copies a limited number of characters from a string, and returns the\n  address of the last character written.\n\n* You no longer need to check for whether the installed `stddef.h' is\n  compatible with the GNU C library.  configure now checks for you.\n\n* You can now define a per-stream `fileno' function to convert the\n  stream's cookie into an integral file descriptor.\n\n* ``malloc (0)'' no longer returns a null pointer.  Instead, it\n  allocates zero bytes of storage, and returns a unique pointer which\n  you can pass to `realloc' or `free'.  The behavior is undefined if\n  you dereference this pointer.\n\n* The C library now runs on Sony NEWS m68k machines running either\n  NewsOS 3 or NewsOS 4.\n\n* The new `syscall' function is a system-dependent primitive function\n  for invoking system calls.  It has the canonical behavior on Unix\n  systems, including unreliable return values for some calls (such as\n  `pipe', `fork' and `getppid').\n\n* The error code `EWOULDBLOCK' is now obsolete; it is always defined\n  to `EAGAIN', which is the preferred name.  On systems whose kernels\n  use two distinct codes, the C library now translates EWOULDBLOCK to\n  EAGAIN in every system call function.\n\f\nVersion 1.06\n\n* The GNU C Library Reference Manual is now distributed with the library.\n  `make dvi' will produce a DVI file of the printed manual.\n  `make info' will produce Info files that you can read on line using C-h i\n  in Emacs or the `info' program.\n  Please send comments on the manual to bug-glibc-manual@gnu.org.\n\n* The library now supports SVR4 on i386s (i386-unknown-sysv4).\n\n* Brendan Kehoe has contributed a port to Sun SPARCs running Solaris 2.\n\n* Jason Merrill has contributed a port to the Sequent Symmetry running\n  Dynix version 3 (i386-sequent-dynix).\n\n* The library has been ported to i386s running SCO 3.2.4 (also known as SCO\n  ODT 2.0; i386-unknown-sco3.2.4) or SCO 3.2 (i386-unknown-sco3.2).\n\n* New function `memory_warnings' lets you arrange to get warnings when\n  malloc is running out of memory to allocate, like Emacs gives you.\n\n* The C library now contains the relocating allocator used in Emacs 19 for\n  its editing buffers.  This allocator (ralloc) minimizes allocation\n  overhead and fragmentation by moving allocated regions around whenever it\n  needs to.  You always refer to a ralloc'd region with a \"handle\" (a\n  pointer to a pointer--an object of type `void **').\n\n* There is a new `printf' format: `%m' gives you the string corresponding\n  to the error code in `errno'.\n\n* In `scanf' formats, you can now use `%as' or `%a[' to do the normal `%s'\n  or `%[' conversion, but instead of filling in a fixed-sized buffer you\n  pass, the `a' modifier says to fill in a `char **' you pass with a\n  malloc'd string.\n\n* The `fnmatch' function supports the new flag bits `FNM_LEADING_DIR' and\n  `FNM_CASEFOLD'.  `FNM_LEADING_DIR' lets a pattern like `foo*' match a\n  name like `foo/bar'.  `FNM_CASEFOLD' says to ignore case in matching.\n\n* `mkstemp' is a traditional Unix function to atomically create and open a\n  uniquely-named temporary file.\n\f\nVersion 1.05\n\n* The standard location for the file that says what the local timezone is\n  has changed again.  It is now `/usr/local/etc/localtime' (or more\n  precisely, `${prefix}/etc/localtime') rather than `/etc/localtime'.\n\n* The distribution no longer contains any files with names longer than 14\n  characters.\n\n* `struct ttyent' has two new flag bits: TTY_TRUSTED and TTY_CONSOLE.\n  These are set by the new `trusted' and `console' keywords in `/etc/ttys'.\n\n* New functions `ttyslot' and `syslog' from 4.4 BSD.\n\f\nVersion 1.04\n\n* The configuration process has changed quite a bit.  The `configure'\n  script is now used just like the configuration scripts for other GNU\n  packages.  The `sysdeps' directory hierarchy is much rearranged.\n  The file `INSTALL' explains the new scheme in detail.\n\n* The header files no longer need to be processed into ANSI C and\n  traditional C versions.  There is just one set of files to install, and\n  it will work with ANSI or old C compilers (including `gcc -traditional').\n\n* Brendan Kehoe and Ian Lance Taylor have ported the library to the\n  MIPS DECStation running Ultrix 4.\n\n* The Sun 4 startup code (crt0) can now properly load SunOS 4 shared libraries.\n  Tom Quinn contributed the initial code.  The GNU C library can NOT yet be\n  made itself into a shared library.\n\n* Yet further improved support for the i386, running 4.3 BSD-like systems\n  (such as Mach 3 with the Unix single-server), or System V.\n\n* New function `strncasecmp' to do case-insensitive string comparison\n  with limited length.\n\n* New function `strsep' is a reentrant alternative to `strtok'.\n\n* New functions `scandir' and `alphasort' for searching directories.\n\n* New function `setenv' is a better interface to `putenv'.\n\n* Ian Lance Taylor has contributed an implementation of the SVID `ftw'\n  function for traversing a directory tree.\n\n* The GNU obstack package is now also part of the C library.\n  The new function `open_obstack_stream' creates a stdio stream that\n  writes onto an obstack; `obstack_printf' and `obstack_vprintf' do\n  formatted output directly to an obstack.\n\n* Miscellaneous new functions: reboot, nice, sigaltstack (4.4 BSD only),\n  cfmakeraw, getusershell, getpass, swab, getttyent, seteuid, setegid.\n\n* `FNM_FILE_NAME' is another name for `FNM_PATHNAME', used with `fnmatch'.\n\n* The new functions `strfry' and `memfrob' do mysterious and wonderful\n  things to your strings.\n\n* There are some new test programs: test-fseek, testmb, and testrand.\n\n* Some work has been done to begin porting the library to 4.4 BSD and Linux.\n  These ports are not finished, but are a good starting place for really\n  supporting those systems.\n\n* `/etc/localtime' is now the standard location for the file that says what\n  the local timezone is, rather than `/usr/local/lib/zoneinfo/localtime'.\n  This follows the general principle that `/etc' is the place for all local\n  configuration files.\n\n* The C library header files now use `extern \"C\"' when used by the C++\n  compiler, so the C library should now work with C++ code.\n\n* The header file <bstring.h> is gone.  <string.h> now declares bcopy,\n  bcmp, bzero, and ffs.  (Update: nowadays these functions are declared\n  in <strings.h>.)\n\n* Mike Haertel (of GNU e?grep and malloc fame) has written a new sorting\n  function which uses the `merge sort' algorithm, and is said to be\n  significantly faster than the old GNU `qsort' function.  Merge sort is\n  now the standard `qsort' function.  The new algorithm can require a lot\n  of temporary storage; so, the old sorting function is called when the\n  required storage is not available.\n\n* The C library now includes Michael Glad's Ultra Fast Crypt, which\n  provides the Unix `crypt' function, plus some other entry points.\n\n* The code and header files taken from 4.4 BSD have been updated with the\n  latest files released from Berkeley.\n\f\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCopyright information:\n\nCopyright (C) 1992-2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n   Permission is granted to anyone to make or distribute verbatim copies\n   of this document as received, in any medium, provided that the\n   copyright notice and this permission notice are preserved,\n   thus giving the recipient permission to redistribute in turn.\n\n   Permission is granted to distribute modified versions\n   of this document, or of portions of it,\n   under the above conditions, provided also that they\n   carry prominent notices stating who last changed them.\n\f\nLocal variables:\nversion-control: never\nfill-column: 76\nEnd:\n"
