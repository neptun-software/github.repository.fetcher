Our goal is to deprecate Sundown altogether before the end of the year.\r\n\r\nThe new parser will be smaller, faster, safer and most importantly, more consistent.\r\n\r\nPlease stay tuned."

A fully functional (X)HTML renderer is included.\n\n*\t**Optimized for speed**\n\n\t`Sundown` is written in C, with a special emphasis on performance. When wrapped\n\ton a dynamic language such as Python or Ruby, it has shown to be up to 40\n\ttimes faster than other native alternatives.\n\n*\t**Zero-dependency**\n\n\t`Sundown` is a zero-dependency library composed of 3 `.c` files and their headers.\n\tNo dependencies, no bullshit. Only standard C99 that builds everywhere.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\n`Sundown` is based on the original Upskirt parser by Natacha Porté, with many additions\nby Vicent Marti (@vmg) and contributions from the following authors:\n\n\tBen Noordhuis, Bruno Michel, Joseph Koshy, Krzysztof Kowalczyk, Samuel Bronson,\n\tShuhei Tanuma\n\nBindings\n--------\n\n`Sundown` is available from other programming languages thanks to these bindings developed\nby our awesome contributors.\n\n- [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) (Ruby)\n- [RobotSkirt](https://github.com/benmills/robotskirt) (Node.js)\n- [Misaka](https://github.com/FSX/misaka) (Python)\n- [ffi-sundown](https://github.com/postmodern/ffi-sundown) (Ruby FFI)\n- [Sundown HS](https://github.com/bitonic/sundown) (Haskell)\n- [Goskirt](https://github.com/madari/goskirt) (Go)\n- [Upskirt.go](https://github.com/buu700/upskirt.go) (Go)\n- [MoonShine](https://github.com/brandonc/moonshine) (.NET)\n- [PHP-Sundown](https://github.com/chobie/php-sundown) (PHP)\n- [Sundown.net](https://github.com/txdv/sundown.net) (.NET)\n\nHelp us\n-------\n\n`Sundown` is all about security. If you find a (potential) security vulnerability in the\nlibrary, or a way to make it crash through malicious input, please report it to us,\neither directly via email or by opening an Issue on GitHub, and help make the web safer\nfor everybody.\n\nUnicode character handling\n--------------------------\n\nGiven that the Markdown spec makes no provision for Unicode character handling, `Sundown`\ntakes a conservative approach towards deciding which extended characters trigger Markdown\nfeatures:\n\n*\tPunctuation characters outside of the U+007F codepoint are not handled as punctuation.\n\tThey are considered as normal, in-word characters for word-boundary checks.\n\n*\tWhitespace characters outside of the U+007F codepoint are not considered as\n\twhitespace. They are considered as normal, in-word characters for word-boundary checks.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nThere is nothing to install. `Sundown` is composed of 3 `.c` files (`markdown.c`,\n`buffer.c` and `array.c`), so just throw them in your project. Zero-dependency means\nzero-dependency. You might want to include `render/html.c` if you want to use the\nincluded XHTML renderer, or write your own renderer. Either way, it's all fun and joy.\n\nIf you are hardcore, you can use the included `Makefile` to build `Sundown` into a dynamic\nlibrary, or to build the sample `sundown` executable, which is just a commandline\nMarkdown to XHTML parser. (If gcc gives you grief about `-fPIC`, e.g. with MinGW, try\n`make MFLAGS=` instead of just `make`.)\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\ncopyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\nWITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.
