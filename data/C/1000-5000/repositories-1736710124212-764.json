The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the\ncopyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our\ncodebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also\nneed to be sure of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you\nknow that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign\nthe CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has\napproved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.\nBefore you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with\nus first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and\npossibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid\nfrustration later on.\n\n### Code reviews\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose.\n\n### The small print\nContributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than\nthe one above, the\n[Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).\n"

          "content": "All configuration data and state is kept in ~/.google_authenticator\nThe file is all ASCII, but is kept in a very simple-to-parse and rigid\nfile format.\n\nThe file size is currently limited to 1kB. This should be generous even\nwhen using a very large list of scratch codes.\n\nThe first line is the base32 encoded secret. It uses characters in the range\nA..Z2..7. The secret is used after first trying any one-time scratch codes.\nHOTP mode is used only if HOTP_COUNTER is present.\nTOTP mode is used only if TOTP_AUTH is present *and* HOTP_COUNTER is\nnot present.\n\nThe following lines are optional. They all start with a double quote character,\nfollowed by a space character. Followed by an option name. Option names are\nall upper-case and must include an underscore. This ensures that they cannot\naccidentally appear anywhere else in the file.\n\nOptions can be followed by option-specific parameters.\n\nCurrently, the following options are recognized:\n\n  DISALLOW_REUSE\n    if present, this signals that a time-based token can be used\n    at most once. Any attempt to log in using the same token will be denied.\n    This means that users can typically not log in faster than once every\n    ~30 seconds.\n\n    The option is followed by a space-separated list of time stamps that\n    have previously been used for login attempts.\n\n    This option has no effect when HOTP_COUNTER is present.\n\n  RATE_LIMIT n m ...\n    this optional parameter restricts the number of logins to at most \"n\"\n    within each \"m\" second interval. Additional parameters in this line are\n    undocumented; they are used internally to keep track of state.\n\n  TOTP_AUTH\n    the presence of this option indicates that the secret can be used to\n    authenticate users with a time-based token.\n\n  STEP_SIZE n\n    the number of seconds in each time step during which a TOTP code is valid.\n    The default is that a code is valid for 30 seconds.\n\n  HOTP_COUNTER n\n    the presence of this option indicates that the secret can be used to\n    authenticate users with a counter-based token.  The argument \"n\"\n    represents which counter value the token will accept next.  It should\n    be initialized to 1.\n\n  WINDOW_SIZE n\n    the default window size is 3, allowing up to one extra valid token\n    before and after the currently active one. This might be too restrictive\n    if the client and the server experience significant time skew.\n    You can provide a parameter to increase the login window size from 3 to \"n\"\n\n    In counter-based mode, this option is the number of valid tokens after\n    the currently active one.  The default is almost certainly too restrictive\n    for most users as invalid login attempts and generated-but-not-used\n    tokens both contribute to synchronization problems.\n\n\nAny all-numeric sequence of eight-digit numbers are randomly generated\none-time scratch code tokens. The user can enter any arbitrary\none-time code to log into his account. The code will then be removed\nfrom the file.\n"

          "content": "# Google Authenticator PAM module\n\nExample PAM module demonstrating two-factor authentication for logging\ninto servers via SSH, OpenVPN, etc…\n\nThis project is not about logging in to Google, Facebook, or other\nTOTP/HOTP second factor systems, even if they recommend using the\nGoogle Authenticator apps.\n\nHMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP) is specified in\n[RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and \nTime-based One-time Password (TOTP) is specified in\n[RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/google-authenticator-libpam.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/google-authenticator-libpam)\n\n## Build & install\n```shell\n./bootstrap.sh\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nIf you don't have access to \"sudo\", you have to manually become \"root\" prior\nto calling \"make install\".\n\n## Setting up the PAM module for your system\n\nFor highest security, make sure that both password and OTP are being requested\neven if password and/or OTP are incorrect. This means that *at least* the first\nof `pam_unix.so` (or whatever other module is used to verify passwords) and\n`pam_google_authenticator.so` should be set as `required`, not `requisite`. It\nprobably can't hurt to have both be `required`, but it could depend on the rest\nof your PAM config.\n\nIf you use HOTP (counter based as opposed to time based) then add the option\n`no_increment_hotp` to make sure the counter isn't incremented for failed\nattempts.\n\nAdd this line to your PAM configuration file:\n\n`  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so no_increment_hotp`\n\n## Setting up a user\n\nRun the `google-authenticator` binary to create a new secret key in your home\ndirectory. These settings will be stored in `~/.google_authenticator`.\n\nIf your system supports the \"libqrencode\" library, you will be shown a QRCode\nthat you can scan using the Android \"Google Authenticator\" application.\n\nIf your system does not have this library, you can either follow the URL that\n`google-authenticator` outputs, or you have to manually enter the alphanumeric\nsecret key into the Android \"Google Authenticator\" application.\n\nIn either case, after you have added the key, click-and-hold until the context\nmenu shows. Then check that the key's verification value matches (this feature\nmight not be available in all builds of the Android application).\n\nEach time you log into your system, you will now be prompted for your TOTP code\n(time based one-time-password) or HOTP (counter-based), depending on options\ngiven to `google-authenticator`, after having entered your normal user id and\nyour normal UNIX account password.\n\nDuring the initial roll-out process, you might find that not all users have\ncreated a secret key yet. If you would still like them to be able to log\nin, you can pass the \"nullok\" option on the module's command line:\n\n`  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok`\n\n## Encrypted home directories\n\nIf your system encrypts home directories until after your users entered their\npassword, you either have to re-arrange the entries in the PAM configuration\nfile to decrypt the home directory prior to asking for the OTP code, or\nyou have to store the secret file in a non-standard location:\n\n`  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so secret=/var/unencrypted-home/${USER}/.google_authenticator`\n\nwould be a possible choice. Make sure to set appropriate permissions. You also\nhave to tell your users to manually move their .google_authenticator file to\nthis location.\n\nIn addition to \"${USER}\", the `secret=` option also recognizes both \"~\" and\n`${HOME}` as short-hands for the user's home directory.\n\nWhen using the `secret=` option, you might want to also set the `user=`\noption. The latter forces the PAM module to switch to a dedicated hard-coded\nuser id prior to doing any file operations. When using the `user=` option, you\nmust not include \"~\" or \"${HOME}\" in the filename.\n\nThe `user=` option can also be useful if you want to authenticate users who do\nnot have traditional UNIX accounts on your system.\n\n## Module options\n\n### secret=/path/to/secret/file\n\nSee \"encrypted home directories\", above.\n\n### authtok_prompt=prompt\n\nOverrides default token prompt. If you want to include spaces in the prompt,\nwrap the whole argument in square brackets:\n\n`  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so [authtok_prompt=Your secret token: ]`\n\n### user=some-user\n\nForce the PAM module to switch to a hard-coded user id prior to doing any file\noperations. Commonly used with `secret=`.\n\n### no_strict_owner\n\nDANGEROUS OPTION!\n\nBy default the PAM module requires that the secrets file must be owned the user\nlogging in (or if `user=` is specified, owned by that user). This option\ndisables that check.\n\nThis option can be used to allow daemons not running as root to still handle\nconfiguration files not owned by that user, for example owned by the users\nthemselves.\n\n### allowed_perm=0nnn\n\nDANGEROUS OPTION!\n\nBy default, the PAM module requires the secrets file to be readable only by the\nowner of the file (mode 0600 by default). In situations where the module is used\nin a non-default configuration, an administrator may need more lenient file\npermissions, or a specific setting for their use case.\n\n### debug\n\nEnable more verbose log messages in syslog.\n\n### try_first_pass / use_first_pass / forward_pass\n\nSome PAM clients cannot prompt the user for more than just the password. To\nwork around this problem, this PAM module supports stacking. If you pass the\n`forward_pass` option, the `pam_google_authenticator` module queries the user\nfor both the system password and the verification code in a single prompt.\nIt then forwards the system password to the next PAM module, which will have\nto be configured with the `use_first_pass` option.\n\nIn turn, `pam_google_authenticator` module also supports both the standard\n`use_first_pass` and `try_first_pass` options. But most users would not need\nto set those on the `pam_google_authenticator`.\n\n### noskewadj\n\nIf you discover that your TOTP code never works, this is most commonly the\nresult of the clock on your server being different from the one on your Android\ndevice. The PAM module makes an attempt to compensate for time skew. You can\nteach it about the amount of skew that you are experiencing, by trying to log\nit three times in a row. Make sure you always wait 30s (but not longer), so\nthat you get three distinct TOTP codes.\n\nSome administrators prefer that time skew isn't adjusted automatically, as\ndoing so results in a slightly less secure system configuration. If you want\nto disable it, you can do so on the module command line:\n\n`  auth required pam_google_authenticator.so noskewadj`\n\n### no_increment_hotp\n\nDon't increment the counter for failed HOTP attempts.  Normally you should set\nthis so failed password attempts by an attacker without a token don't lock out\nthe authorized user.\n\n### nullok\n\nAllow users to log in without OTP, if they haven't set up OTP yet.\n\nPAM requires at least one `SUCCESS` answer from a module, and `nullok`\ncauses this module to say `IGNORE`. This means that if this option is\nused at least one other module must have said `SUCCESS`. One way to do\nthis is to add `auth required pam_permit.so` to the end of the PAM\nconfig.\n\n### echo_verification_code\n\nBy default, the PAM module does not echo the verification code when it is\nentered by the user. In some situations, the administrator might prefer a\ndifferent behavior. Pass the `echo_verification_code` option to the module\nin order to enable echoing.\n\nIf you would like verification codes that are counter based instead of\ntimebased, use the `google-authenticator` binary to generate a secret key in\nyour home directory with the proper option.  In this mode, clock skew is\nirrelevant and the window size option now applies to how many codes beyond the\ncurrent one that would be accepted, to reduce synchronization problems.\n\n### grace_period=seconds\n\nIf present and non-zero, provide a grace period during which a second\nverification code will not be requested. Try setting seconds to 86400\nto allow a full-day between requesting codes; or 3600 for an hour.\n\nThis works by adding an (IP address, timestamp) pair to the security\nfile after a successful one-time-password login;\nonly the last ten distinct IP addresses are tracked.\n\n### allow_readonly\n\nDANGEROUS OPTION!\n\nWith this option an attacker with ability to fill up the filesystem (flood\nserver with web requests, or if they have an account just fill the disk up) can\nforce a situation where one-time-passwords can be reused, defeating the purpose\nof \"one time\".\n\nBy default, if the `grace_period` option is defined the PAM module requires\nsome free space to store the IP address and timestamp of the last login.\nIt could prevent access if a server has no free space or in case of an\nupdate config file error. With the `allow_readonly` option you can ignore\nany errors which could occur during config file update.\n"
