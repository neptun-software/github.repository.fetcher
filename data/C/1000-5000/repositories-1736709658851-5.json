A prior copy of the game is required to extract the needed assets.**\n\n**Website:** <https://zelda.deco.mp>\n\n**Discord:** <https://discord.zelda.deco.mp>\n\n## Installation\n\nWe recommend using WSL on Windows, or native Linux, which the rest of this readme describes. We currently have instructions for\n\n* [Windows](#Windows), with and without WSL\n* [macOS](docs/BUILDING_MACOS.md)\n* [Linux](#Linux-Native-or-under-WSL--VM), natively or using WSL / VM\n* [Docker](docs/BUILDING_DOCKER.md)\n\n(These will also depend on the Linux instructions.)\nSome of these may also be out of date or unmaintained; usually our contributors use WSL, Linux, and macOS, so these instructions should be up to date.\n\n### Windows\n\nFor Windows 10 or 11, install WSL and a distribution by following this\n[WSL Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\nWe recommend using Ubuntu 20.04 as the Linux distribution.\n\nFor older versions of Windows, install a Linux VM or refer to [Docker](docs/BUILDING_DOCKER.md) instructions.\n\n\n### Linux (Native or under WSL / VM)\n\n#### 1. Install build dependencies\n\nThe build process has the following package requirements:\n\n* git\n* build-essential\n* binutils-mips-linux-gnu\n* curl\n* python3\n* python3-pip\n* python3-venv\n* libpng-dev\n* libxml2-dev\n\nUnder Debian / Ubuntu (which we recommend using), you can install them with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install git build-essential binutils-mips-linux-gnu curl python3 python3-pip python3-venv libpng-dev libxml2-dev\n```\n\nIf you are using GCC as the compiler for Ocarina of Time, you will also need:\n\n* gcc-mips-linux-gnu\n\n#### 2. Clone the repository\n\n**N.B.** If using WSL, we strongly encourage you to clone into WSL's Linux filesystem using Linux's `git`.\nCloning into the Windows filesystem will result in much slower read/write speeds, and often causes issues when Windows copies the files with the wrong line endings, which the compiler IDO cannot handle correctly.\n\nClone `https://github.com/zeldaret/oot.git` where you wish to have the project, with a command such as:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/zeldaret/oot.git\n```\n\nThis will copy the GitHub repository contents into a new folder in the current directory called `oot`. Change into this directory before doing anything else:\n\n```bash\ncd oot\n```\n\n#### 3. Prepare a base ROM\n\nPlace a copy of the Master Quest (Debug) ROM inside the `baseroms/gc-eu-mq-dbg/` folder.\nIf you are under WSL, you can run the command `explorer.exe .` to open the current directory in the Windows file explorer.\n\nRename the file to `baserom.z64`, `baserom.n64` or `baserom.v64`, depending on the original extension.\n\n#### 4. Setup the ROM and build process\n\nSetup and extract everything from your ROM with the following command:\n\n```bash\nmake setup\n```\n\nThis downloads some dependencies (from pip), and compiles tools for the build process.\nThen it generates a new ROM `baseroms/gc-eu-mq-dbg/baserom-decompressed.z64` that will have the overdump removed and the header patched.\nIt will also extract the individual assets from the ROM.\n\n#### 5. Build the ROM\n\nRun make to build the ROM.\nMake sure your path to the project is not too long, otherwise this process may error.\n\n```bash\nmake\n```\n\nIf all goes well, a new ROM should be built at `build/gc-eu-mq-dbg/oot-gc-eu-mq-dbg.z64`, and the following text printed:\n\n```bash\nbuild/gc-eu-mq-dbg/oot-gc-eu-mq-dbg.z64: OK\n```\n\nIf you instead see the following:\n\n```bash\nbuild/gc-eu-mq-dbg/oot-gc-eu-mq-dbg.z64: FAILED\nmd5sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match\n```\n\nThis means that the built ROM isn't the same as the base one, so something went wrong or some part of the code doesn't match.\n\n**NOTE:** to speed up the build, you can either:\n\n* pass `-jN` to `make setup` and `make`, where N is the number of threads to use in the build. The generally-accepted wisdom is to use the number of virtual cores your computer has.\n* pass `-j` to `make setup` and `make`, to use as many threads as possible, but beware that this can use too much memory on lower-end systems.\n\nBoth of these have the disadvantage that the ordering of the terminal output is scrambled, so for debugging it is best to stick to one thread (i.e. not pass `-j` or `-jN`).\n\n## Changing build options\n\nThe project Makefile is fairly configurable and can be used to build other versions of the game or prepare the repo for modding.\nSee the options outlined at the top of the Makefile for more information.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAll contributions are welcome. This is a group effort, and even small contributions can make a difference.\nSome tasks also don't require much knowledge to get started.\n\nMost discussions happen on our [Discord Server][discord], where you are welcome to ask if you need help getting started, or if you have any questions regarding this project and other decompilation projects.\n"
