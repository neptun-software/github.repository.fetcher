Thanks to over 1700 backers from our [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1980078555/chameleonmini-a-versatile-nfc-card-emulator-and-mo), the current Revision G has been realized by Kasper & Oswald GmbH.\n\nThe ChameleonMini RevG is now also available via the Kasper & Oswald [Webshop](https://shop.kasper.it/). Thank you for supporting the project!\n\nIMPORTANT: Third-party Clones\n------------------\nWe are aware of various third-party ChameleonMini clones or modified variants that are available on the Internet. Warning: We have evidence that some of these devices are defective or suffer from reading problems et cetera. Please understand that we cannot give support for these non-official devices, as we have no schematics / layout or other information, nor do we know the manufacturers. In case of problems, please contact the manufacturers of your device directly.\n\nNote to the manufacturers: Some of the third-party ChameleonMini are violating the ChameleonMini license, please obey the license (see LICENSE.txt)!\n\nFirst Steps\n-----------\nTo upgrade the firmware of your ChameleonMini, please visit the [Getting Started page](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/emsec/ChameleonMini/master/Doc/Doxygen/html/Page_GettingStarted.html) from the [doxygen documentation](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/emsec/ChameleonMini/master/Doc/Doxygen/html/index.html).\n\nSupported Cards and Codecs\n--------------------------\nSee [here](https://github.com/emsec/ChameleonMini/wiki/Supported-Cards-and--Codecs). The linked wiki page also includes notes on DESFire emulation and certain cases of application specific emulation (Gallagher).\n\nQuestions\n---------\nIf you have any questions, please visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/emsec/ChameleonMini/issues) and ask your questions there so everyone benefits from the answer.\n\n**Please note that we cannot give any support if you have issues with the RevE-rebooted hardware or any GUI. Please use this issues page only for problems with the RevG hardware as distributed by Kasper & Oswald and for problems with the firmware from this page.** \n\nExternal Contributions\n----------------------\nWe appreciate every contribution to the project. Have a look at the [External Contributions page](https://github.com/emsec/ChameleonMini/wiki/External-Contributions).\n\nRepository Structure\n--------------------\nThe code repository contains\n* Doc: A doxygen documentation\n* Drivers: Chameleon drivers for Windows and Linux\n* Dumps: Dumps of different smartcards\n* Hardware: The layout and schematics of the PCB\n* Firmware: The complete firmware including a modified Atmel DFU bootloader and LUFA\n* Software: Contains a python tool for an easy configuration (and more) of the ChameleonMini, Note that this is currently under construction\n* RevE: Contains the whole contents of the discontinued RevE repository.\n* RevE-light: Contains our development files for the RevE-light - **WARNING:** currently not supported / not functional\n"
