Now `ALT + PAUSE` will be pressed when TX is triggered. \n\nThis key combo normally doesn't do anything, but you can capture it with a software and then perform your own actions. \n\n### Windows \n\nYou can use [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com). It is a powerful and free open-source keyboard automation program, where you can write a script to do anything you want when `ALT + PAUSE` is pressed by RX.\n\nCheck out the [official tutorials](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs_1.0/Tutorial.htm), and here's a [sample configuration file](resources/AutoHotkey.ahk) upon which you can tinker with. \n\n### macOS\n\nWhen you first plug RX into your mac, a window might pop up asking to identify keyboard layout, simply close it.\n\nGo to `System Preferences` -> `Keyboard` -> `Shortcuts` -> `App Shortcuts`:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/applescript.png)\n\nClick the box to the right of `Keyboard Shortcut`, trigger the TX, and it will fill in the box for you.\n\nYou can then add a shortcut to launch an application, or execute an applescript.\n\nFor more advanced scripting needs, you can try [bettertouchtool](https://folivora.ai), which can be considered macOS equivalent of autohotkey.\n\n### Android\n\nBelieve it or not Daytripper also works on Android!\n\nYou can use [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com) with [Autoinput plugin](https://joaoapps.com/autoinput/).\n\nHere is a tutorial: https://forum.joaoapps.com/index.php?resources/react-to-keys-from-a-real-keyboard.79/\n\n### Linux\n\nOh I'm sure you'll figure it out ðŸ˜‰\n\n## Adjusting Advanced Parameters\n\nThe default settings of Daytripper demonstrates a good balance between accuracy, sensitivity, and battery life. \n\nHowever, you can also adjust them to suit your particular needs.\n\n### Update the Firmware\n\nIf you purchased your Daytripper before **`Sept 2020`**, you will need to update your TX to the latest firmware. Please do so by following the [USB Firmware Update](#usb-firmware-updates) section below.\n\n### Find the COM Port\n\n**`Right click`** on the start button, then select `Device Manager`:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/app/start.png)\n\nMake sure the TX is **`TURNED OFF`**, then plug it into your computer with a USB-C cable.\n\nIn the `Ports (COM & LPT)` section, A new `USB Serial Device` should appear.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/app/devmgr.png)\n\nRemember the number! **`COM5`** in this case. Yours might be different.\n\n### Download the Application\n\n[Head here to download the latest release](https://github.com/dekuNukem/daytripper/releases/latest) for Windows and macOS.\n\n* The software is in early stages of development. If you run into any problems, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/dekuNukem/daytripper/issues), ask in the [official Daytripper discord](https://discord.gg/VM4kbnf), DM me on discord `dekuNukem#6998`, or contact me through `dekuNukem`@`gmail`.`com`.\n\n### \"Untrusted App\" Warnings\n\nWhen trying to run the app, your system might complain about this software being untrusted. This is because I haven't had the code digitally signed, which costs hundreds of dollars a year.\n\nPlease feel free to [review the code](https://github.com/dekuNukem/daytripper/tree/master/pc_software). If you don't trust the app, you can run the `duckypad_config.py` script itself with Python3.\n\nFor Windows 10, click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/app/defender.png)\n\nFor macOS, **`RIGHT CLICK`** on the app and select `Open`. You might have to do it twice.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/app/warning_mac.png)\n\nAfter the app has launched, press `Refresh` button, select the COM port with the correct number, and press `Connect`.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/app/sercon.png)\n\nOn macOS or Linux, the serial port will have different names, and mostly likely will have the word `usb` in it.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/app/macser.png)\n\nAnyway, if connection is successful, a number of options is presented:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/app/mainapp.png)\n\n* Drag the slider to adjust values.\n\n* Click **`What's this?`** to learn about a particular setting.\n\n* To return to default, click **`Reset to Default`** in a section, or **`Reset all`** on top right corner.\n\n* Click **`Save Changes`** to save the current configuration to your Daytripper.\n\n* You can make a backup of your settings with the buttons on lower left corner.\n\n* A description of parameters follows.\n\n### Refresh Rate\n\nHow many times per second TX takes a reading **`while on battery`**. Turn it up to make TX more sensitive to faster motions, at the expense of battery life.\n\nHere is a table of approximate Battery Life vs Refresh Rate:\n\n| Refresh Rate (Hz) | Battery Life (Hours) |\n|-------------------|----------------------|\n| 2                 | 100                  |\n| 6 (Default)       | 50                   |\n| 10                | 30                   |\n| 15                | 20                   |\n| 30                | 12                   |\n\nPlease note that your battery life might be more or less depending on your lighting conditions and number of triggers.\n\nTX will always run at fastest refresh rate (30Hz) when plugged in.\n\n### Noise Reduction\n\nBy default TX will take additional readings to prevent false triggers from sensor noise.\n\nIf turned off, TX will become **`much more`** sensitive to motion, but might also produce false triggers from time to time.\n\nTurn it off if motion sensitivity is absolutely critical and occasional false triggers is acceptable.\n\n### Timing Budget\n\nAmount of time allocated to the laser sensor to produce a reading.\n\nA larger value gives more accurate measurements, at the expense of reduced battery life and refresh rate.\n\nI suggest leaving it at default for normal operations.\n\n### Detection Range\n\nAdjust the values here if you want Daytripper to only monitor motions within a certain distance range.\n\n### LED Indicator\n\nThe blue LED comes on when TX is triggered. You can disable it to make your Daytripper less noticeable.\n\n### Print Debug Info\n\nTX prints some debug messages through its hardware UART. Turning it off might save a tiny bit of battery life.\n\n### Save It!!\n\nAgain, don't forget to press **`Save Changes`** button to save the current configuration to your Daytripper.\n\n## On-air Packet Format\n\nDaytripper uses a nRF24L01-compatible chip called Si24R1. It is less expensive, and actually has a higher TX power output, resulting in longer communication range.\n\nDaytripper operates at `channel 115`, `address 0xDA 0xBB 0xED 0xC0 0x0C`.\n\nData rate is `250kbps`, TX power is `+7dBm`, `Auto Acknowledgment` is used.\n\nDaytripper TX sends 6-byte packets, details below:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/packets.png)\n\n* The first byte (byte 0) is a unique identifier calculated from the microcontroller serial number. \n\n* Second byte (byte 1) denotes what this packet is about. It can be either a test packet, trigger packet, or status update packet.\n\n* The rest 4 bytes are payloads, their meaning depending on the command type (byte 1).\n\n* For a `Test` packet, the 4 bytes are the same incrementing sequence number repeated 4 times. \n\n* For a `Trigger` packet, the first two bytes are the baseline reading of the power-up calibration. And the last two bytes are the actual distance reading. Unit in mm.\n\n* For a `status` packet, the first two bytes are the latest battery voltage reading in mV. The last two bytes are the time-since-power-on count, multiply it by 5 to get the number of seconds elapsed since TX power-on.\n\n* The `vbat_mV` is about 300mV lower than the actual battery voltage, due to the diode drop. \n\n## Debug Modes\n\nThere is a user button on both TX and RX board. Usually they are unused:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/buttons.jpg)\n\nFor RX, a press on the button types out some debug messages. Make sure you open a text editor first. If the RX has not received any messages from the TX, the debug values will all be zero.\n\n## USB Firmware Updates\n\nYou can update Daytripper's firmware via USB, for bug fixes and and/or new features. \n\nFirst, [click me](https://github.com/dekuNukem/daytripper/raw/master/resources/en.stsw-stm32080_stm32_DfuSe.zip) to download and install the `STM32 DfuSe tool` from this repo.\n\n(You can also get it from [the official website](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html), but it requires creating an account.)\n\nLocate the user button on the board:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/buttons.jpg)\n\nTo update firmware:\n\n* Make sure the board is **`TURNED OFF`** and unplugged.\n\n* **Press and hold down the user button** while plugging it into a computer.\n\n* Once it is plugged in, you can release the button.\n\n* If all goes well, the blue LED should stay off.\n\nNow launch the `DfuSeDemo` software:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/dfu_start.png)\n\nYou should see a `STM Device in DFU Mode` in the `Available DUF Devices` section at top left corner.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/dfu_available.png)\n\n* If nothing shows up, you might need to install a driver. [Click me for details](dfu_driver_install.md)  \n\nPress the `Choose...` button and select a firmware file in `.dfu` format. Make sure it's the correct file!\n\n* [Click me](https://github.com/dekuNukem/daytripper/raw/master/firmware/TX_1.1.2.dfu) for latest TX firmware (1.1.2)\n\n* [Click me](https://github.com/dekuNukem/daytripper/raw/master/firmware/RX_1.0.1.dfu) for latest RX firmware (1.0.1)\n\n* [Click me](/firmware_version_history.md) for older firmwares.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/dfu_choose.png)\n\nPress `Upgrade` button to start uploading the new firmware into the microcontroller.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/dfu_upgrade.png)\n\nAnd now the firmware is being updated!\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/dfu_uploading.png)\n\nIt could take anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes. Try using different USB ports if it is particularly slow. \n\nAfter uploading is complete, unplug and turn it back on to start using the new firmware. \n\n* Your custom settings will be lost after flashing a new firmware, so make sure to set it up again!\n\n-----\n\nIf you generated a `.hex` file yourself, you can convert it to a `.dfu` file with the `Dfu file manager` and then upload this way. \n\nThis method is nice for occasional firmware updates, but quite cumbersome if you want to do extensive reprogramming. It's faster to get a ST-Link programmer and use the Keil uVision IDE. [See this guide](https://github.com/dekuNukem/STM32_tutorials) for more information on STM32 developments.\n\n## Trigger Output\n\nThere is an **`active-high`** trigger output on RX. This pin will go from GND to 3.3V for **`around 200ms`** when a trigger from TX is received.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/rx_trig_out.jpg)\n\nOn earlier production runs, the pin is on a testpad. On the later runs, the pin has its own header hole.\n\nMake sure **everything is on the same GND** when connecting external circuits!\n\nUnfortunately, TX does not have a dedicated trigger out pin due to limited microcontroller pins. However, there is a debug output that prints out some serial data upon triggering at 115200bps, which you can parse.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/tx_trig_out.jpg)\n\n## Using Multiple Modules\n\nDaytripper wasn't really designed with multiple TX/RX boards in mind. I haven't done any extensive testings on this subject, however most of the time it does seem to work.\n\n### Single RX Multiple TX\n\nIn this scenario RX will react when ANY of the multiple TX fires.\n\n### Single TX Multiple RX\n\nHere ALL of RX will react when TX fires.\n\n### Multiple TX Multiple RX\n\nUntested, probably a mess. \n\n## Questions or Comments?\n\nPlease feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckypad/issues), ask in the [official Daytripper discord](https://discord.gg/VM4kbnf), DM me on discord `dekuNukem#6998`, or email `dekuNukem`@`gmail`.`com` for inquires.\n\n------\n\n[Main Page](/README.md) | [Buy Daytripper](https://www.tindie.com/products/dekuNukem/daytripper)\n"

Here is a short guide on how to put everything together.\n\nIf yours is already assembled, please move on to the [Quick Start Guide](/quick_start_guide.md).\n\n## Recommended Tools\n\nA pliers and a small Phillips-head screwdriver would make tightening the fasteners easier.\n\nHowever this assembly is perfectly doable with your bare hands, so don't sweat if you don't have them.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/tools.jpg)\n\n## Handling Bare Circuit Boards\n\nWhen handling the bare circuit board, remember to:\n\n* Wash your hands first\n\n* Always hold the circuit board by its edge\n\n* Don't touch the components\n\nThe reason for hand-washing is to reduce the risk of static electricity(SE) on your body zapping the board and damage it, especially in dry weather.\n\nBy washing your hands, you release the existing SE through the metal water pipe, your hands are moist to prevent further SE build-up, and your clean hands won't leave greasy fingerprints all over the place, win-win-win!\n\nOf course, your hands can't be dripping wet either, but that's just common sense.\n\n## Mind the Switches!\n\nDuring assembly, be careful not to accidentally break off the handles of the switches on the two circuit boards:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/switches.jpg)\n\n## Assembly Steps\n\nYou should have the following parts, keep a note of their names as I'm going to refer to them later. \n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/components.jpg)\n\nFirst off peel off the protective film on the `Acrylic Front and Back plate`. You don't have to do it if you like the unpeeled look. \n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/film.jpg)\n\nGather the `Acrylic Back Plate`, `4x M2 Standoffs 6mm`, and `4x M2 Screws 18mm`.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/back.jpg)\n\nThread the screw through the hole, then screw on the standoffs.\n\nDo not overtighten the standoff! Doing so might crack the acrylic plate. Finger-tight is OK, just make sure they're not loose and doesn't rattle.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/back_in.jpg)\n\nWash your hands, grab the circuit board by its edge, and install the `TX board` as shown:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/tx_in.jpg)\n\nScrew on the `4x M2 Standoff 4mm`. Moderately tighten.\n\n* If you're using pilers, make sure it doesn't bump into circuit board components while turning!\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/tx_m2.jpg)\n\nInstall the `Acrylic Front Plate` as shown. \n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/tx_plate.jpg)\n\nPut on the nuts. Again don't overtighten. Might be easier with pilers. \n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/tx_nut.jpg)\n\nFlip it over. Clean the backplate with a dry cloth if dirty.\n\nPeel the metal plate from the white side to expose the adhesives.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/metal_peel.jpg)\n\nStick the metal plate to the back plate, preferably where the battery is. \n\nPeel off the blue protective film, and we're done!\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/done.jpg)\n\nNow your Daytripper is ready to use! Head over to the [Quick Start Guide](/quick_start_guide.md) to get going.\n\n## Questions or Comments?\n\nPlease feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckypad/issues), ask in the [official Daytripper discord](https://discord.gg/VM4kbnf), DM me on discord `dekuNukem#6998`, or email `dekuNukem`@`gmail`.`com` for inquires.\n\n------\n\n[Main Page](/README.md) | [Buy Daytripper](https://www.tindie.com/products/dekuNukem/daytripper)\n"

          "content": "# The Baffling Intermittent Glitch\r\n\r\n## Discovery\r\n\r\nRecently a few of my customer told me that the daytripper they received didn't work properly after assembled. Once turned on, the LED on the TX unit would breath for a few seconds, then go completely dead and not responding to objects in front of the sensors. \r\n\r\nI initially provided them with free replacements right away, however it did make me wonder how did it happen, since I personally test every single board before mailing them out.\r\n\r\nOne of the customers told me that the affected TX would work fine on its own as a bare circuit board, but go bad once assembled with front and back plates, which was even more baffling. How could some screws and two acrylic plates affect the functionality of the circuit board?\r\n\r\n## Investigation\r\n\r\nI put together a handful of TX boards trying to replicate the problem, testing to make sure they work both before and after. I assembled about 20 of them before finally got one that's misbehaving. The board would work fine on its own, but stop working once the upper standoffs were tightened to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nI hooked up a debugger to see where it was stuck in the firmware. It appeared to be waiting forever at [checking if a packet transmission is complete](https://github.com/dekuNukem/daytripper/blob/865081e2ba3adbdf7ebfdae3229aa89da2c86ae7/firmware/tx_bss/Src/helpers.c#L200). Looking deeper into that, the data received from SPI are all `0x0` instead of usual `0x13`.\r\n\r\nI didn't think much of it and kept on messing around. At one point I desoldered the battery to see if it would help, and miraculously it did! The TX would work no matter how much the standoffs were tightened. \r\n\r\nThings became clear once I looked at the circuit board more closely. Here is the back of the affected TX board, you can just barely see a scratch mark near the center:\r\n\r\n![Alt text](resources/photos/glitch1.jpeg)\r\n\r\nWhat happened was that, on certain batteries, the negative terminal tab sticks out more than others:\r\n\r\n![Alt text](resources/photos/glitch2.jpeg)\r\n\r\nAs a result, for the majority of the boards, there is an air gap between the bottom of the battery and the circuit board, all is well:\r\n\r\n![Alt text](resources/photos/glitch3.jpeg)\r\n\r\nBut on the affected boards, the protruding battery terminal is very nearly touching the circuit board:\r\n\r\n![Alt text](resources/photos/glitch4.jpeg)\r\n\r\nSince they were not *actually* touching, everything would work fine when I test the bare circuit board myself. But when installed with fasteners, the back plate would push the terminal into the circuit board, scratching it, and grounding the SPI MISO data line. As a result, the firmware would get `0x0` from SPI, and stuck on waiting for a response.\r\n\r\n## Remedy\r\n\r\nFrom now on...\r\n\r\n* Insulating materials will be added between the battery and circuit board\r\n\r\n* Washers will be used so the back plate is less likely to push against the battery\r\n\r\n* Visual inspection will be carried out to spot problem boards before shipping\r\n\r\n* Traces will be rerouted away from potentially scratch-prone area in the future production run\r\n\r\n## Existing Customers\r\n\r\nThis problem only affects a very small number of TX boards. If your daytripper is working fine, you don't have to do anything.\r\n\r\nIf you do encounter a similar problem, there are a number of ways to sort this out:\r\n\r\n### Try Fixing It Yourself\r\n\r\n* [Follow this guide in reverse](https://github.com/dekuNukem/daytripper/blob/master/assembly_guide.md) and disassemble the TX to bare circuit board.\r\n\r\n* Hold it like the above photos, check the gap and see if battery is touching the board\r\n\r\n* Try inserting a piece of paper between the two to prevent them from touching. Gently pull the battery up slightly to widen the gap, then slide the paper in.\r\n\r\n* If it works, congrats! Feel free to contact me for a partial refund for the trouble.\r\n\r\n* If not...\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\n\r\nIf you weren't able to fix it yourself, do feel free to contact me with your Tindie order number. I'll be happy to offer you a full refund or mail you another set for free.\r\n"

          "content": "# Daytripper Quick Start Guide\n\n[Buy on Tindie!](https://www.tindie.com/products/dekuNukem/daytripper-hide-my-windows-laser-tripwire/) | [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/VM4kbnf) | [Getting Started](quick_start_guide.md) | [Main Page](/README.md)\n\n------\n\nThis guide shows you how to use the Daytripper.\n\nIf yours hasn't been assembled yet, please [see this guide to put it together](/assembly_guide.md)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBy now, you should have the assembled transmitter(TX) and receiver(RX) boards.\n\nPlease observe the various names that will be referred to later:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/face.jpg)\n\nYour RX board should have a translucent protective cover, don't remove it!\n\nPlug the RX into your computer. Its blue LED should start breathing then go dim, and your PC should recognize it as an USB keyboard.\n\nSometimes the system will install a driver, wait for it to finish.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/rxplug.jpg)\n\nPut the TX flat on the table. Turn it on (gently!) using the power switch.\n\nThe blue LED should start breathing, as the laser sensor gets a baseline distance reading.\n\nDaytripper is triggered when further readings deviate too much from this initial baseline.\n\nThe blue LED should eventually go out, that means TX is armed and ready. \n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/txon.gif)\n\nNow put your hand in front of the sensor window, all your windows should be instantly minimized.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/rick.gif)\n\nThat's pretty much the gist of it! However please do keep reading for more important information.\n\n## Mounting options\n\nNow you know how Daytripper works, time to mount it at a desired location.\n\nIf you're trying to detect someone walking by, you can mount it to a wall using the included magnet.\n\n* Simply tape the magnet to the wall, then you can attach and detach the TX with ease.\n\nIf you can find a metal surface, it's even easier:\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/mount.gif)\n\nTo detect a door opening, simply put it on the ground so the door opens into it.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/door.jpg)\n\nThose are just two suggestions, you can get as creative as you want!\n\n## Test It Out!\n\nIt is very important that you **`TEST YOUR SETUP THOROUGHLY BEFORE USING IT FOR REAL!`**\n\nA couple of key areas to note:\n\n### Mounting Location\n\n* Make sure the location provide adequate coverage for potential threats.\n\n* You can conceal the TX if you want, just leave the sensor window clear, and don't touch the components on the circuit board.\n\n### Power-On Order\n\n* Always turn on the TX **`AFTER`** you finish mounting it, so the initial calibration won't get messed up by your hand.\n\n### Motion Sensitivity\n\n* Approach the TX like your potential threats would, does TX trigger consistently?\n\n* If yes, congrats! You're all set.\n\n* If not, you can turn up the refresh rate to make TX more sensitive to motion, at the cost of battery life.\n\n* You can also leave TX plugged in at all times, in which case it will operate at the fastest refresh rate.\n\n* To see how, **`finish reading this guide first`**, then head to the [Advanced Usage Guide](/advanced_usage.md).\n\n### Your Applications\n\n* Try it out with the application you're trying to hide!\n\n* By default, RX will press `WIN + M` when triggered. This works with almost all desktop apps.\n\n* However, it might not work with certain fullscreen games.\n\n* If so, try switching your game to `borderless fullscreen` in graphic settings, if available.\n\n* If all else fails, move the `Mode Select` switch to `LOCK` so RX will lock your computer instead.\n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/rxback.jpg)\n\n* There is also a `Custom` option for executing custom commands, but that's for [advanced usages](/advanced_usage.md).\n\n## Good to Know\n\nDaytripper works by monitoring distance changes with an eye-safe laser sensor. As a result, there are some important information to keep in mind: \n\n* The laser works between 2cm to 120cm (0.8 to 47 inches), so make sure the motion happens within this range. \n\n* Daytripper works best in indoor conditions. Harsh ambient lighting such as direct sunlight might overwhelm the laser and affect detection range and sensitivity. \n\n* By default, the laser sensor scans at 6 times per second (Hz) while on battery power. It is automatically increased to 30Hz (fastest) when powered by USB.\n\n* You can adjust a number of advanced parameters to suit your particular needs. Please see [this guide](/advanced_usage.md) for details.\n\n* The transmission range between TX and RX is around 100 meters (330 feet) in open air. Although it is likely to be shorter in indoor environments with walls and other wireless interferences.\n\n* The battery on TX should last around 50 hours with default configuration. You can recharge it using a USB Type-C cable.\n\n* Don't touch the components on the circuit board with your bare hands, especially the laser sensor!\n\n* Daytripper is most sensitive if the laser can be bounced straight back from the subject instead of at an angle.\n\n* Certain materials might absorb the laser instead of reflecting it back, affecting performance. Those materials tends to be very deep black in color with a soft texture. \n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nBoth TX and RX have a blue status LED. The meanings are detailed in tables below. \n\n![Alt text](resources/photos/lights_meaning.png)\n\nTX boards also have a yellow LED, which comes on when the battery is charging.\n\n## Advanced Usages\n\nOnce you're familiar with how Daytripper works, you can take a look at the [Advanced Usage Guide](/advanced_usage.md) for some additional features that might be of interest.\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nAlthough I have spent a lot of time on this project, I cannot guarantee its functionality in every condition.\n\nThis is not a safety device, do not use it for safety critical situations. \n\nI am not responsible for the consequences of using this device. Use it at your own risk. \n\n## Questions or Comments?\n\nPlease feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckypad/issues), ask in the [official Daytripper discord](https://discord.gg/VM4kbnf), DM me on discord `dekuNukem#6998`, or email `dekuNukem`@`gmail`.`com` for inquires.\n\n------\n\n[Main Page](/README.md) | [Buy Daytripper](https://www.tindie.com/products/dekuNukem/daytripper)\n"
