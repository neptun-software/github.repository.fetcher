By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.

This file is offered as-is,\nwithout warranty of any kind.\n\nBasic Installation\n==================\n\n   Briefly, the shell command './configure && make && make install'\nshould configure, build, and install this package.  The following\nmore-detailed instructions are generic; see the 'README' file for\ninstructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this\n'INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented\nbelow.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not\nnecessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found\nin *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.\n\n   The 'configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for\nvarious system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses\nthose values to create a 'Makefile' in each directory of the package.\nIt may also create one or more '.h' files containing system-dependent\ndefinitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script 'config.status' that\nyou can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a\nfile 'config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for\ndebugging 'configure').\n\n   It can also use an optional file (typically called 'config.cache' and\nenabled with '--cache-file=config.cache' or simply '-C') that saves the\nresults of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is disabled by\ndefault to prevent problems with accidental use of stale cache files.\n\n   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try\nto figure out how 'configure' could check whether to do them, and mail\ndiffs or instructions to the address given in the 'README' so they can\nbe considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at\nsome point 'config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you\nmay remove or edit it.\n\n   The file 'configure.ac' (or 'configure.in') is used to create\n'configure' by a program called 'autoconf'.  You need 'configure.ac' if\nyou want to change it or regenerate 'configure' using a newer version of\n'autoconf'.\n\n   The simplest way to compile this package is:\n\n  1. 'cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type\n     './configure' to configure the package for your system.\n\n     Running 'configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints\n     some messages telling which features it is checking for.\n\n  2. Type 'make' to compile the package.\n\n  3. Optionally, type 'make check' to run any self-tests that come with\n     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.\n\n  4. Type 'make install' to install the programs and any data files and\n     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is\n     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular\n     user, and only the 'make install' phase executed with root\n     privileges.\n\n  5. Optionally, type 'make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but\n     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.\n     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a\n     regular user, particularly if the prior 'make install' required\n     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed\n     correctly.\n\n  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the\n     source code directory by typing 'make clean'.  To also remove the\n     files that 'configure' created (so you can compile the package for\n     a different kind of computer), type 'make distclean'.  There is\n     also a 'make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly\n     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get\n     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came\n     with the distribution.\n\n  7. Often, you can also type 'make uninstall' to remove the installed\n     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that\n     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the\n     GNU Coding Standards.\n\n  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide 'make\n     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other\n     targets like 'make install' and 'make uninstall' work correctly.\n     This target is generally not run by end users.\n\nCompilers and Options\n=====================\n\n   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that\nthe 'configure' script does not know about.  Run './configure --help'\nfor details on some of the pertinent environment variables.\n\n   You can give 'configure' initial values for configuration parameters\nby setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here is\nan example:\n\n     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix\n\n   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.\n\nCompiling For Multiple Architectures\n====================================\n\n   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the\nsame time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their\nown directory.  To do this, you can use GNU 'make'.  'cd' to the\ndirectory where you want the object files and executables to go and run\nthe 'configure' script.  'configure' automatically checks for the source\ncode in the directory that 'configure' is in and in '..'.  This is known\nas a \"VPATH\" build.\n\n   With a non-GNU 'make', it is safer to compile the package for one\narchitecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have\ninstalled the package for one architecture, use 'make distclean' before\nreconfiguring for another architecture.\n\n   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and\nexecutables that work on multiple system types--known as \"fat\" or\n\"universal\" binaries--by specifying multiple '-arch' options to the\ncompiler but only a single '-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like\nthis:\n\n     ./configure CC=\"gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64\" \\\n                 CXX=\"g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64\" \\\n                 CPP=\"gcc -E\" CXXCPP=\"g++ -E\"\n\n   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you\nmay have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results\nusing the 'lipo' tool if you have problems.\n\nInstallation Names\n==================\n\n   By default, 'make install' installs the package's commands under\n'/usr/local/bin', include files under '/usr/local/include', etc.  You\ncan specify an installation prefix other than '/usr/local' by giving\n'configure' the option '--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an\nabsolute file name.\n\n   You can specify separate installation prefixes for\narchitecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you\npass the option '--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to 'configure', the package uses\nPREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.\nDocumentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.\n\n   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give\noptions like '--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular\nkinds of files.  Run 'configure --help' for a list of the directories\nyou can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the default\nfor these options is expressed in terms of '${prefix}', so that\nspecifying just '--prefix' will affect all of the other directory\nspecifications that were not explicitly provided.\n\n   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the\ncorrect locations to 'configure'; however, many packages provide one or\nboth of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the\n'make install' command line to change installation locations without\nhaving to reconfigure or recompile.\n\n   The first method involves providing an override variable for each\naffected directory.  For example, 'make install\nprefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all\ndirectory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of\n'${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during 'configure',\nbut not in terms of '${prefix}', must each be overridden at install time\nfor the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of makefile\nvariable overrides for each directory variable is required by the GNU\nCoding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.  However, some\nplatforms have known limitations with the semantics of shared libraries\nthat end up requiring recompilation when using this method, particularly\nnoticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.\n\n   The second method involves providing the 'DESTDIR' variable.  For\nexample, 'make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend\n'/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of\n'DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and\ndoes not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,\nit does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even\nwhen some directory options were not specified in terms of '${prefix}'\nat 'configure' time.\n\nOptional Features\n=================\n\n   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed\nwith an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving 'configure' the\noption '--program-prefix=PREFIX' or '--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.\n\n   Some packages pay attention to '--enable-FEATURE' options to\n'configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.\nThey may also pay attention to '--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE\nis something like 'gnu-as' or 'x' (for the X Window System).  The\n'README' should mention any '--enable-' and '--with-' options that the\npackage recognizes.\n\n   For packages that use the X Window System, 'configure' can usually\nfind the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,\nyou can use the 'configure' options '--x-includes=DIR' and\n'--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.\n\n   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the\nexecution of 'make' will be.  For these packages, running './configure\n--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be\noverridden with 'make V=1'; while running './configure\n--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be\noverridden with 'make V=0'.\n\nParticular systems\n==================\n\n   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU CC\nis not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in\norder to use an ANSI C compiler:\n\n     ./configure CC=\"cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500\"\n\nand if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.\n\n   HP-UX 'make' updates targets which have the same timestamps as their\nprerequisites, which makes it generally unusable when shipped generated\nfiles such as 'configure' are involved.  Use GNU 'make' instead.\n\n   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot\nparse its '<wchar.h>' header file.  The option '-nodtk' can be used as a\nworkaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended to\ntry\n\n     ./configure CC=\"cc\"\n\nand if that doesn't work, try\n\n     ./configure CC=\"cc -nodtk\"\n\n   On Solaris, don't put '/usr/ucb' early in your 'PATH'.  This\ndirectory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of\nthese programs are available in '/usr/bin'.  So, if you need '/usr/ucb'\nin your 'PATH', put it _after_ '/usr/bin'.\n\n   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in '/boot/common',\nnot '/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:\n\n     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common\n\nSpecifying the System Type\n==========================\n\n   There may be some features 'configure' cannot figure out\nautomatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package\nwill run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the\n_same_ architectures, 'configure' can figure that out, but if it prints\na message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the\n'--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system\ntype, such as 'sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:\n\n     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM\n\nwhere SYSTEM can have one of these forms:\n\n     OS\n     KERNEL-OS\n\n   See the file 'config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If\n'config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't\nneed to know the machine type.\n\n   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should\nuse the option '--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will\nproduce code for.\n\n   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a\nplatform different from the build platform, you should specify the\n\"host\" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will\neventually be run) with '--host=TYPE'.\n\nSharing Defaults\n================\n\n   If you want to set default values for 'configure' scripts to share,\nyou can create a site shell script called 'config.site' that gives\ndefault values for variables like 'CC', 'cache_file', and 'prefix'.\n'configure' looks for 'PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then\n'PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the\n'CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.\nA warning: not all 'configure' scripts look for a site script.\n\nDefining Variables\n==================\n\n   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the\nenvironment passed to 'configure'.  However, some packages may run\nconfigure again during the build, and the customized values of these\nvariables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set\nthem in the 'configure' command line, using 'VAR=value'.  For example:\n\n     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc\n\ncauses the specified 'gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is\noverridden in the site shell script).\n\nUnfortunately, this technique does not work for 'CONFIG_SHELL' due to an\nAutoconf limitation.  Until the limitation is lifted, you can use this\nworkaround:\n\n     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash\n\n'configure' Invocation\n======================\n\n   'configure' recognizes the following options to control how it\noperates.\n\n'--help'\n'-h'\n     Print a summary of all of the options to 'configure', and exit.\n\n'--help=short'\n'--help=recursive'\n     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's\n     'configure', and exit.  The 'short' variant lists options used only\n     in the top level, while the 'recursive' variant lists options also\n     present in any nested packages.\n\n'--version'\n'-V'\n     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the 'configure'\n     script, and exit.\n\n'--cache-file=FILE'\n     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,\n     traditionally 'config.cache'.  FILE defaults to '/dev/null' to\n     disable caching.\n\n'--config-cache'\n'-C'\n     Alias for '--cache-file=config.cache'.\n\n'--quiet'\n'--silent'\n'-q'\n     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To\n     suppress all normal output, redirect it to '/dev/null' (any error\n     messages will still be shown).\n\n'--srcdir=DIR'\n     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually\n     'configure' can determine that directory automatically.\n\n'--prefix=DIR'\n     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names:: for\n     more details, including other options available for fine-tuning the\n     installation locations.\n\n'--no-create'\n'-n'\n     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output\n     files.\n\n'configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run\n'configure --help' for more details.\n"

Note that we did not heard about any other utility\nthat would have solved them.\n\n- Several scripts generating complex filenames may not find them (ex: img.src='image'+a+Mobj.dst+'.gif')\n- Some java classes may not find some files on them (class included)\n- Cgi-bin links may not work properly in some cases (parameters needed). To avoid them: use filters like -*cgi-bin*\n\n\nAdvanced options:\n\nThese options may not be necessary for a normal usage. But they can solve several problems.\n\n- If you need more than 100,000 links: -#L1000000 (1,000,000 links)\n- If you need more than 500 filters: -#F1000 (1,000 filters)\n- If you need transfer rate statistics every minutes: -#Z\n- If you need transfer operations statistics every minutes: -#T\n- If you want log files to be refreshed after every line: -#f\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nHave fun with HTTrack Website Copier!\nThe authors\n\n"

We avoid this by adding\n## dummy dependencies for each header file.  Too bad gcc doesn't do\n## this for us directly.\n## Some versions of gcc put a space before the ':'.  On the theory\n## that the space means something, we add a space to the output as\n## well.  hp depmode also adds that space, but also prefixes the VPATH\n## to the object.

This translation is distributed in the hope that it will\nfacilitate understanding, but it is not an official or legally approved\ntranslation.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation (FSF) is not the publisher of this\ntranslation and has not approved it as a legal substitute for the\nauthentic GNU General Public License. The translation has not been\nreviewed carefully by lawyers, and therefore the translator cannot be\nsure that it exactly represents the legal meaning of the authentic GNU\nGeneral Public License published in English. This translation does not\nlegally state the terms and conditions of use of any Program licenced\nunder GNU GPL  only the original English text of the GNU LGPL does\nthat. If you wish to be sure whether your planned activities are\npermitted by the GNU General Public License, please refer to its sole\nauthentic English version.\n\nThe FSF strongly urges you not to use this translation as the official\ndistribution terms for your programs; instead, please use the authentic\nEnglish version published by the FSF. If you choose to convey this\ntranslation along with a Program covered by the GPL Licence, this does\nnot remove your obligation to convey at the same time a copy of the\nauthentic GNU GPL License in English, and you must keep in this\ntranslation this important warning in English and its equivalent in\nFrench above.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPréambule\n\nLa Licence Publique Générale GNU (GNU General Public License) est une\nlicence libre, en copyleft, destinée aux uvres logicielles et\ndautres types de travaux.\n\nLes licences de la plupart des uvres logicielles et autres travaux de\npratique sont conçues pour ôter votre liberté de partager et modifier\nces travaux. En contraste, la Licence Publique Générale GNU a pour but\nde garantir votre liberté de partager et changer toutes les versions\ndun programme  afin dassurer quil restera libre pour tous les\nutilisateurs. Nous, la Free Software Foundation, utilisons la Licence\nPublique Générale GNU pour la plupart de nos logiciels ; cela\nsapplique aussi à tout autre travail édité de cette façon par ses\nauteurs. Vous pouvez, vous aussi, lappliquer à vos propres programmes.\n\nQuand nous parlons de logiciel libre (free), nous nous référons à la\nliberté (freedom), pas au prix. Nos Licences Publiques Générales sont\nconçues pour assurer que vous ayez la liberté de distribuer des copies\nde logiciel libre (et le facturer si vous le souhaitez), que vous\nreceviez le code source ou pouviez lobtenir si vous le voulez, que\nvous pouviez modifier le logiciel ou en utiliser toute partie dans de\nnouveaux logiciels libres, et que vous sachiez que vous avez le droit\nde faire tout ceci.\n\nPour protéger vos droits, nous avons besoin dempêcher que dautres\nvous restreignent ces droits ou vous demande de leur abandonner ces\ndroits. En conséquence, vous avez certaines responsabilités si vous\ndistribuez des copies dun tel programme ou si vous le modifiez :\nles responsabilités de respecter la liberté des autres.\n\nPar exemple, si vous distribuez des copies dun tel programme, que ce\nsoit gratuit ou contre un paiement, vous devez accorder aux\nDestinataires les mêmes libertés que vous avez reçues. Vous devez aussi\nvous assurer queux aussi reçoivent ou peuvent recevoir son code\nsource. Et vous devez leur montrer les termes de cette licence afin\nquils connaissent leurs droits.\n\nLes développeurs qui utilisent la GPL GNU protègent vos droits en deux\nétapes : (1) ils affirment leur droits dauteur (copyright) sur le\nlogiciel, et (2) vous accordent cette Licence qui vous donne la\npermission légale de le copier, le distribuer et/ou le modifier.\n\nPour la protection des développeurs et auteurs, la GPL stipule\nclairement quil ny a pas de garantie pour ce logiciel libre. Aux fins\nà la fois des utilisateurs et auteurs, la GPL requière que les versions\nmodifiées soient marquées comme changées, afin que leurs problèmes ne\nsoient pas attribués de façon erronée aux auteurs des versions\nprécédentes.\n\nCertains dispositifs sont conçus pour empêcher laccès des utilisateurs\nà linstallation ou lexécution de versions modifiées du logiciel à\nlintérieur de ces dispositifs, alors que les fabricants le peuvent.\nCeci est fondamentalement incompatible avec le but de protéger la\nliberté des utilisateurs de modifier le logiciel. Laspect systématique\nde tels abus se produit dans le secteur des produits destinés aux\nutilisateurs individuels, ce qui est précidément ce qui est le plus\ninacceptable. Aussi, nous avons conçu cette version de la GPL pour\nprohiber cette pratique pour ces produits. Si de tels problèmes\nsurviennent dans dautres domaines, nous nous tenons prêt à étendre\ncette restriction à ces domaines dans de futures versions de la GPL,\nautant quil sera nécessaire pour protéger la liberté des utilisateurs.\n\nFinalement, chaque programme est constamment menacé par les brevets\nlogiciels. Les États ne devraient pas autoriser de tels brevets à\nrestreindre le développement et lutilisation de logiciels libres sur\ndes ordinateurs dusage général ; mais dans ceux qui le font, nous\nvoulons spécialement éviter le danger que les brevets appliqués à un\nprogramme libre puisse le rendre effectivement propriétaire. Pour\nempêcher ceci, la GPL assure que les brevets ne peuvent être utilisés\npour rendre le programme non-libre.\n\nLes termes précis et conditions concernant la copie, la distribution\net la modification suivent.\n\n\nTERMES ET CONDITIONS\n\n\nArticle 0. Définitions.\n\n« Cette Licence » se réfère à la version 3 de la GNU General Public\nLicense (le texte original en anglais).\n\n« Droit dAuteur » signifie aussi les droits du copyright ou voisins\nqui sappliquent à dautres types de travaux, tels que ceux sur les\nmasques de semi-conducteurs.\n\n« Le Programme » se réfère à tout travail qui peut être sujet au Droit\ndAuteur (copyright) et dont les droits dutilisation sont concédés\nen vertu de cette Licence. Chacun des Licenciés, à qui cette Licence\nest concédée, est désigné par « vous. » Les « Licenciés » et les\n« Destinataires » peuvent être des personnes physiques ou morales\n(individus ou organisations).\n\n« Modifier » un travail signifie en obtenir une copie et adapter tout\nou partie du travail dune façon nécessitant une autorisation dun\ntitulaire de Droit dAuteur, autre que celle permettant den produire\nune copie conforme. Le travail résultant est appelé une « version\nmodifiée » du précédent travail, ou un travail « basé sur » le\nprécédent travail.\n\nUn « Travail Couvert » signifie soit le Programme non modifié soit un\ntravail basé sur le Programme.\n\n« Propager » un travail signifie faire quoi que ce soit avec lui qui,\nsans permission, vous rendrait directement ou indirectement responsable\ndun délit de contrefaçon suivant les lois relatives au Droit dAuteur,\nà lexception de son exécution sur un ordinateur ou de la modification\ndune copie privée. La propagation inclue la copie, la distribution\n(avec ou sans modification), la mise à disposition envers le public, et\naussi d'autres activités dans certains pays.\n\n« Acheminer » un travail signifie tout moyen de propagation de celui-ci\nqui permet à dautres parties de réaliser ou recevoir des copies. La\nsimple interaction dun utilisateur à travers un réseau informatique,\nsans transfert effectif dune copie, ne constitue pas un acheminement.\n\nUne interface utilisateur interactive affiche des « Notices Légales\nAppropriées » quand elle comprend un dispositif convenable, bien\nvisible et évident qui (1) affiche une notice appropriée sur les droits\ndauteur et (2) informe lutilisateur quil ny a pas de garantie pour\nle travail (sauf si des garanties ont été fournies hors du cadre de\ncette Licence), que les licenciés peuvent acheminer le travail sous\ncette Licence, et comment voir une copie de cette Licence. Si\nlinterface présente une liste de commandes utilisateur ou doptions,\ntel quun menu, un élément évident dans la liste présentée remplit ce\ncritère.\n\n\nArticle 1. Code source.\n\nLe « code source » dun travail signifie la forme préférée du travail\npermettant ou facilitant les modifications de celui-ci. Le « code\nobjet » dun travail signifie toute forme du travail qui nen est pas\nle code source.\n\nUne « Interface Standard » signifie une interface qui est soit celle\ndune norme officielle définie par un organisme de normalisation\nreconnu ou, dans le cas des interfaces spécifiées pour un langage de\nprogrammation particulier, une interface largement utilisée parmi les\ndéveloppeurs travaillant dans ce langage.\n\nLes « Bibliothèques Système » dun travail exécutable incluent tout ce\nqui, en dehors du travail dans son ensemble, (a) est inclus dans la\nforme usuelle de paquetage dun Composant Majeur mais ne fait pas\npartie de ce Composant Majeur et (b) sert seulement à permettre\nlutilisation du travail avec ce Composant Majeur ou à implémenter une\nInterface Standard pour laquelle une implémentation est disponible au\npublic sous forme de code source ; un « Composant Majeur » signifie,\ndans ce contexte, un composant majeur essentiel (noyau, système de\nfenêtrage, etc.) du système dexploitation (le cas échéant) dun\nsystème sur lequel le travail exécutable fonctionne, ou bien un\ncompilateur utilisé pour produire le code objet du travail, ou un\ninterprète de code objet utilisé pour exécuter celui-ci.\n\nLe « Source Correspondant » dun travail sous forme de code objet\nsignifie lensemble des codes sources nécessaires pour générer,\ninstaller et (dans le cas dun travail exécutable) exécuter le code\nobjet et modifier le travail, y compris les scripts pour contrôler ces\nactivités. Cependant, cela ninclue pas les Bibliothèques Système du\ntravail, ni les outils dusage général ou les programmes libres\ngénéralement disponibles qui peuvent être utilisés sans modification\npour achever ces activités mais ne sont pas partie de ce travail. Par\nexemple le Source Correspondant inclut les fichiers de définition\ndinterfaces associés aux fichiers sources du travail, et le code\nsource des bibliothèques partagées et des sous-routines liées\ndynamiquement, pour lesquelles le travail est spécifiquement conçu pour\nles requérir via, par exemple, des communications de données ou\ncontrôles de flux internes entre ces sous-programmes et dautres\nparties du travail.\n\nLe Source Correspondant na pas besoin dinclure tout ce que les\nutilisateurs peuvent regénérer automatiquement à partir dautres\nparties du Source Correspondant.\n\nLe Source Correspondant pour un travail sous forme de code source est\nce même travail.\n\n\nArticle 2. Permissions de base.\n\nTous les droits accordés suivant cette Licence le sont jusquau terme\ndes Droits dAuteur (copyright) sur le Programme, et sont\nirrévocables pourvu que les conditions établies soient remplies. Cette\nLicence affirme explicitement votre permission illimitée dexécuter le\nProgramme non modifié. La sortie produite par lexécution dun Travail\nCouvert nest couverte par cette Licence que si cette sortie, étant\ndonné leur contenu, constitue un Travail Couvert. Cette Licence\nreconnait vos propres droits dusage raisonnable (fair use en\nlégislation des États-Unis dAmérique) ou autres équivalents, tels\nquils sont pourvus par la loi applicable sur le Droit dAuteur\n(copyright).\n\nVous pouvez créer, exécuter et propager sans condition des Travaux\nCouverts que vous nacheminez pas, aussi longtemps que votre licence\ndemeure en vigueur. Vous pouvez acheminer des Travaux Couverts à\ndautres personnes dans le seul but de leur faire réaliser des\nmodifications à votre usage exclusif, ou pour quils vous fournissent\ndes facilités vous permettant dexécuter ces travaux, pourvu que vous\nvous conformiez aux termes de cette Licence lors de lacheminement de\ntout matériel dont vous ne contrôlez pas le Droit dAuteur\n(copyright). Ceux qui, dès lors, réalisent ou exécutent pour vous les\nTravaux Couverts ne doivent alors le faire quexclusivement pour votre\npropre compte, sous votre direction et votre contrôle, suivant des\ntermes qui leur interdisent de réaliser, en dehors de leurs relations\navec vous, toute copie de votre matériel soumis au Droit dAuteur.\n\nLacheminement dans toutes les autres circonstances nest permis que\nselon les conditions établies ci-dessous. La concession de\nsous-licences nest pas autorisé ; larticle 10 rend cet usage non\nnécessaire.\n\n\nArticle 3. Protection des droits légaux des utilisateurs envers les\nlois anti-contournement.\n\nAucun Travail Couvert ne doit être vu comme faisant partie dune mesure\ntechnologique effective selon toute loi applicable remplissant les\nobligations prévues à larticle 11 du traité international sur le droit\ndauteur adopté à lOMPI le 20 décembre 1996, ou toutes lois similaires\nqui prohibent ou restreignent le contournement de telles mesures.\n\nSi vous acheminez un Travail Couvert, vous renoncez à tout pouvoir légal\ndinterdire le contournement des mesures technologiques dans tous les\ncas où un tel contournement serait effectué en exerçant les droits\nprévus dans cette Licence pour ce Travail Couvert, et vous déclarez\nrejeter toute intention de limiter lopération ou la modification du\nTravail, en tant que moyens de renforcer, à lencontre des utilisateurs\nde ce Travail, vos droits légaux ou ceux de tierces parties dinterdire\nle contournement des mesures technologiques.\n\n\nArticle 4. Acheminement des copies conformes.\n\nVous pouvez acheminer des copies conformes du code source du Programme\ntel que vous lavez reçu, sur nimporte quel support, pourvu que vous\npubliiez scrupuleusement et de façon appropriée sur chaque copie une\nnotice de Droit dAuteur appropriée ; gardez intactes toutes les\nnotices établissant que cette Licence et tous les termes additionnels non\npermissifs ajoutés en accord avec larticle 7 sappliquent à ce code ;\net donnez à chacun des Destinataires une copie de cette Licence en même\ntemps que le Programme.\n\nVous pouvez facturer à un prix quelconque, y compris gratuit, chacune\ndes copies que vous acheminez, et vous pouvez offrir une protection\nadditionnelle de support ou de garantie en échange dun paiement.\n\n\nArticle 5. Acheminement des versions sources modifiées.\n\nVous pouvez acheminer un travail basé sur le Programme, ou bien les\nmodifications pour le produire à partir du Programme, sous la forme de\ncode source suivant les termes de larticle 4, pourvu que vous\nsatisfassiez aussi à chacune des conditions requises suivantes :\n\n  a) Le travail doit comporter des notices évidentes établissant que\n     vous lavez modifié et donnant la date correspondante.\n\n  b) Le travail doit comporter des notices évidentes établissant quil\n     est édité selon cette Licence et les conditions ajoutées daprès\n     larticle 7. Cette obligation vient modifier lobligation de\n     larticle 4 de « garder intactes toutes les notices. »\n\n  c) Vous devez licencier le travail entier, comme un tout, suivant\n     cette Licence à quiconque entre en possession dune copie. Cette\n     Licence sappliquera en conséquence, avec les termes additionnels\n     applicables prévus par larticle 7, à la totalité du travail et\n     chacune de ses parties, indépendamment de la façon dont ils sont\n     empaquetés. Cette licence ne donne aucune permission de licencier\n     le travail dune autre façon, mais elle ninvalide pas une telle\n     permission si vous lavez reçue séparément. \n\n  d) Si le travail a des interfaces utilisateurs interactives, chacune\n     doit afficher les Notices Légales Appropriées ; cependant si le\n     Programme a des interfaces qui naffichent pas les Notices Légales\n     Appropriées, votre travail na pas à les modifier pour quelles\n     les affichent. \n\nUne compilation dun Travail Couvert avec dautres travaux séparés et\nindépendants, qui ne sont pas par leur nature des extensions du Travail\nCouvert, et qui ne sont pas combinés avec lui de façon à former un\nprogramme plus large, dans ou sur un volume de stockage ou un support\nde distribution, est appelé un « aggrégat » si la compilation et son\nDroit dAuteur résultant ne sont pas utilisés pour limiter laccès ou\nles droits légaux des utilisateurs de la compilation en deça de ce que\npermettent les travaux individuels. Linclusion dun Travail Couvert\ndans un aggrégat ne cause pas lapplication de cette Licence aux\nautres parties de laggrégat.\n\n\nArticle 6. Acheminement des formes non sources.\n\nVous pouvez acheminer sous forme de code objet un Travail Couvert\nsuivant les termes des articles 4 et 5, pourvu que vous acheminiez\négalement suivant les termes de cette Licence le Source Correspondant\nlisible par une machine, dune des façons suivantes :\n\n  a) Acheminer le code objet sur, ou inclus dans, un produit physique\n     (y compris un support de distribution physique), accompagné par le\n     Source Correspondant fixé sur un support physique durable\n     habituellement utilisé pour les échanges de logiciels.\n\n  b) Acheminer le code objet sur, ou inclus dans, un produit physique\n     (y compris un support de distribution physique), accompagné dune\n     offre écrite, valide pour au moins trois années et valide pour\n     aussi longtemps que vous fournissez des pièces de rechange ou un\n     support client pour ce modèle de produit, afin de donner à\n     quiconque possède le code objet soit (1) une copie du Source\n     Correspondant à tout logiciel dans ce produit qui est couvert par\n     cette Licence, sur un support physique durable habituellement\n     utilisé pour les échanges de logiciels, pour un prix non supérieur\n     au coût raisonnable de la réalisation physique de lacheminement\n     de la source, ou soit (2) un accès permettant de copier le Source\n     Correspondant depuis un serveur réseau sans frais.\n\n  c) Acheminer des copies individuelles du code objet avec une copie de\n     loffre écrite de fournir le Source Correspondant. Cette\n     alternative est permise seulement occasionellement et non\n     commercialement, et seulement si vous avez reçu le code objet avec\n     une telle offre, en accord avec larticle 6 alinéa b.\n\n  d) Acheminer le code objet en offrant un accès depuis un emplacement\n     désigné (gratuit ou contre facturation) et offrir un accès\n     équivalent au Source Correspondant de la même façon via le même\n     emplacement et sans facturation supplémentaire. Vous navez pas\n     besoin dobliger les Destinataires à copier le Source\n     Correspondant en même temps que le code objet. Si lemplacement\n     pour copier le code objet est un serveur réseau, le Source\n     Correspondant peut être sur un serveur différent (opéré par vous\n     ou par un tiers) qui supporte des facilités équivalentes de\n     copie, pourvu que vous mainteniez des directions claires à\n     proximité du code objet indiquant où trouver le Source\n     Correspondant. Indépendamment de quel serveur héberge le Source\n     Correspondant, vous restez obligé de vous assurer quil reste\n     disponible aussi longtemps que nécessaire pour satisfaire à ces\n     obligations.\n\n  e) Acheminer le code objet en utilisant une transmission\n     dégal-à-égal, pourvu que vous informiez les autres participants\n     sur où le code objet et le Source Correspondant du travail sont\n     offerts sans frais au public général suivant larticle 6 alinéa d.\n     Une portion séparable du code objet, dont le code source est exclu\n     du Source Correspondant en tant que Bibliothèque Système, na pas\n     besoin dêtre inclu dans lacheminement du travail sous forme de\n     code objet.\n\nUn « Produit Utilisateur » est soit (1) un « Produit de Consommation, »\nce qui signifie toute propriété personnelle tangible normalement\nutilisée à des fins personnelles, familiales ou relatives au foyer,\nsoit (2) toute chose conçue ou vendue pour lincorporation dans un lieu\ndhabitation. Pour déterminer si un produit constitue un Produit de\nConsommation, les cas ambigus sont résolus en fonction de la\ncouverture. Pour un produit particulier reçu par un utilisateur\nparticulier, lexpression « normalement utilisée » ci-avant se réfère\nà une utilisation typique ou lusage commun de produits de même\ncatégorie, indépendamment du statut de cet utilisateur particulier ou\nde la façon spécifique dont cet utilisateur particulier utilise\neffectivement ou sattend lui-même ou est attendu à utiliser ce\nproduit. Un produit est un Produit de Consommation indépendamment du\nfait que ce produit a ou na pas dutilisations substantielles\ncommerciales, industrielles ou hors Consommation, à moins que de telles\nutilisations représentent le seul mode significatif dutilisation du\nproduit.\n\nLes « Informations dInstallation » dun Produit Utilisateur signifient\ntoutes les méthodes, procédures, clés dautorisation ou autres\ninformations requises pour installer et exécuter des versions modifiées\ndun Travail Couvert dans ce Produit Utilisateur à partir dune version\nmodifiée de son Source Correspondant. Les informations qui suffisent à\nassurer la continuité de fonctionnement du code objet modifié ne\ndoivent en aucun cas être empêchées ou interférées du seul fait quune\nmodification a été effectuée.\n\nSi vous acheminez le code objet dun Travail Couvert dans, ou avec, ou\nspécifiquement pour lutilisation dans, un Produit Utilisateur et\nlacheminement se produit en tant quélément dune transaction dans\nlaquelle le droit de possession et dutilisation du Produit\nUtilisateur est transféré au Destinataire définitivement ou pour un\nterme fixé (indépendamment de la façon dont la transaction est\ncaractérisée), le Source Correspondant acheminé selon cet article-ci\ndoit être accompagné des Informations dInstallation. Mais cette\nobligation ne sapplique pas si ni vous ni aucune tierce partie ne\ndétient la possibilité dintaller un code objet modifié sur le Produit\nUtilisateur (par exemple, le travail a été installé en mémoire morte).\n\nLobligation de fournir les Informations dInstallation ninclue pas\ncelle de continuer à fournir un service de support, une garantie ou des\nmises à jour pour un travail qui a été modifié ou installé par le\nDestinataire, ou pour le Produit Utilisateur dans lequel il a été\nmodifié ou installé. Laccès à un réseau peut être rejeté quand la\nmodification elle-même affecte matériellement et défavorablement les\nopérations du réseau ou viole les règles et protocoles de communication\nau travers du réseau.\n\nLe Source Correspondant acheminé et les Informations dInstallation\nfournies, en accord avec cet article, doivent être dans un format\npubliquement documenté (et dont une implémentation est disponible\nauprès du public sous forme de code source) et ne doit nécessiter\naucune clé ou mot de passe spécial pour le dépaquetage, la lecture ou\nla copie.\n\n\nArticle 7. Termes additionnels.\n\nLes « permissions additionelles » désignent les termes qui\nsupplémentent ceux de cette Licence en émettant des exceptions à lune\nou plusieurs de ses conditions. Les permissions additionnelles qui\nsont applicables au Programme entier doivent être traitées comme si\nelles étaient incluent dans cette Licence, dans les limites de leur\nvalidité suivant la loi applicable. Si des permissions additionnelles\nsappliquent seulement à une partie du Programme, cette partie peut\nêtre utilisée séparément suivant ces permissions, mais le Programme\ntout entier reste gouverné par cette Licence sans regard aux\npermissions additionelles.\n\nQuand vous acheminez une copie dun Travail Couvert, vous pouvez à\nvotre convenance ôter toute permission additionelle de cette copie, ou\nde nimporte quelle partie de celui-ci. (Des permissions\nadditionnelles peuvent être rédigées de façon à requérir leur propre\nsuppression dans certains cas où vous modifiez le travail.) Vous\npouvez placer les permissions additionnelles sur le matériel acheminé,\najoutées par vous à un Travail Couvert pour lequel vous avez ou pouvez\ndonner les permissions de Droit dAuteur (copyright) appropriées.\n\nNonobstant toute autre clause de cette Licence, pour tout constituant\nque vous ajoutez à un Travail Couvert, vous pouvez (si autorisé par les\ntitulaires de Droit dAuteur pour ce constituant) supplémenter les\ntermes de cette Licence avec des termes :\n\n  a) qui rejettent la garantie ou limitent la responsabilité de façon\n     différente des termes des articles 15 et 16 de cette Licence ; ou\n\n  b) qui requièrent la préservation de notices légales raisonnables\n     spécifiées ou les attributions dauteur dans ce constituant ou\n     dans les Notices Légales Appropriées affichées par les travaux qui\n     le contiennent ; ou\n\n  c) qui prohibent la représentation incorrecte de lorigine de ce\n     constituant, ou qui requièrent que les versions modifiées dun tel\n     constituant soit marquées par des moyens raisonnables comme\n     différentes de la version originale ; ou\n\n  d) qui limitent lusage à but publicitaire des noms des concédants de\n     licence et des auteurs du constituant ; ou\n\n  e) qui refusent à accorder des droits selon la législation relative\n     aux marques commerciales, pour lutilisation dans des noms\n     commerciaux, marques commerciales ou marques de services ; ou\n\n  f) qui requièrent lindemnisation des concédants de licences et\n     auteurs du constituant par quiconque achemine ce constituant (ou\n     des versions modifiées de celui-ci) en assumant contractuellement\n     la responsabilité envers le Destinataire, pour toute\n     responsabilité que ces engagements contractuels imposent\n     directement à ces octroyants de licences et auteurs.\n\nTous les autres termes additionnels non permissifs sont considérés\ncomme des « restrictions avancées » dans le sens de larticle 10. Si le\nProgramme tel que vous lavez reçu, ou toute partie de celui-ci,\ncontient une notice établissant quil est gouverné par cette Licence en\nmême temps quun terme qui est une restriction avancée, vous pouvez\nôter ce terme. Si un document de licence contient une restriction\navancée mais permet la reconcession de licence ou lacheminement\nsuivant cette Licence, vous pouvez ajouter un Travail Couvert\nconstituant gouverné par les termes de ce document de licence, pourvu\nque la restriction avancée ne survit pas à un telle cession de licence\nou acheminement.\n\nSi vous ajoutez des termes à un Travail Couvert en accord avec cet\narticle, vous devez placer, dans les fichiers sources appropriés, une\ndéclaration des termes additionnels qui sappliquent à ces fichiers, ou\nune notice indiquant où trouver les termes applicables.\n\nLes termes additionnels, quils soient permissifs ou non permissifs,\npeuvent être établis sous la forme dune licence écrite séparément, ou\nétablis comme des exceptions ; les obligations ci-dessus sappliquent\ndans chacun de ces cas.\n\n\nArticle 8. Terminaison.\n\nVous ne pouvez ni propager ni modifier un Travail Couvert autrement que\nsuivant les termes de cette Licence. Toute autre tentative de le\npropager ou le modifier est nulle et terminera automatiquement vos\ndroits selon cette Licence (y compris toute licence de brevet accordée\nselon le troisième paragraphe de larticle 11).\n\nCependant, si vous cessez toute violation de cette Licence, alors votre\nlicence depuis un titulaire de Droit dAuteur (copyright) est\nréinstaurée (a) à titre provisoire à moins que et jusquà ce que le\ntitulaire de Droit dAuteur termine finalement et explicitement votre\nlicence, et (b) de façon permanente si le titulaire de Droit dAuteur\nne parvient pas à vous notifier de la violation par quelque moyen\nraisonnable dans les soixante (60) jours après la cessation.\n\nDe plus, votre licence depuis un titulaire particulier de Droit\ndAuteur est réinstaurée de façon permanente si ce titulaire vous\nnotifie de la violation par quelque moyen raisonnable, cest la\npremière fois que vous avez reçu une notification deviolation de cette\nLicence (pour un travail quelconque) depuis ce titulaire de Droit\ndAuteur, et vous résolvez la violation dans les trente (30) jours qui\nsuivent votre réception de la notification.\n\nLa terminaison de vos droits suivant cette section ne terminera pas les\nlicences des parties qui ont reçu des copies ou droits de votre part\nsuivant cette Licence. Si vos droits ont été terminés et non\nréinstaurés de façon permanente, vous nêtes plus qualifié à recevoir\nde nouvelles licences pour les mêmes constituants selon larticle 10.\n\n\nArticle 9. Acceptation non requise pour obtenir des copies.\n\nVous nêtes pas obligé daccepter cette licence afin de recevoir ou\nexécuter une copie du Programme. La propagation asservie dun Travail\nCouvert qui se produit simplement en conséquence dune transmission\ndégal-à-égal pour recevoir une copie ne nécessite pas lacceptation.\nCependant, rien dautre que cette Licence ne vous accorde la\npermission de propager ou modifier un quelconque Travail Couvert. Ces\nactions enfreignent le Droit dAuteur si vous nacceptez pas cette\nLicence. Par conséquent, en modifiant ou propageant un Travail Couvert,\nvous indiquez votre acceptation de cette Licence pour agir ainsi.\n\n\nArticle 10. Cession automatique de Licence aux Destinataires et\nintermédiaires.\n\nChaque fois que vous acheminez un Travail Couvert, le Destinataire\nreçoit automatiquement une licence depuis les concédants originaux,\npour exécuter, modifier et propager ce travail, suivant les termes de\ncette Licence. Vous nêtes pas responsable du renforcement de la\nconformation des tierces parties avec cette Licence.\n\nUne « transaction dentité » désigne une transaction qui transfère le\ncontrôle dune organisation, ou de substantiellement tous ses actifs,\nou la subdivision dune organisation, ou la fusion de plusieurs\norganisations. Si la propagation dun Travail Couvert résulte dune\ntransaction dentité, chaque partie à cette transaction qui reçoit une\ncopie du travail reçoit aussi les licences pour le travail que le\nprédécesseur intéressé à cette partie avait ou pourrait donner selon le\nparagraphe précédent, plus un droit de possession du Source\nCorrespondant de ce travail depuis le prédécesseur intéressé si ce\nprédécesseur en dispose ou peut lobtenir par des efforts raisonnables.\n\nVous ne pouvez imposer aucune restriction avancée dans lexercice des\ndroits accordés ou affirmés selon cette Licence. Par exemple, vous ne\npouvez imposer aucun paiement pour la licence, aucune royaltie, ni\naucune autre charge pour lexercice des droits accordés selon cette\nLicence ; et vous ne pouvez amorcer aucun litige judiciaire (y compris\nune réclamation croisée ou contre-réclamation dans un procès) sur\nlallégation quune revendication de brevet est enfreinte par la\nréalisation, lutilisation, la vente, loffre de vente, ou\nlimportation du Programme ou dune quelconque portion de celui-ci.\n\n\nArticle 11. Brevets.\n\nUn « contributeur » est un titulaire de Droit dAuteur (copyright)\nqui autorise lutilisation selon cette Licence du Programme ou du\ntravail sur lequel le Programme est basé. Le travail ainsi soumis à\nlicence est appelé la « version contributive » de ce contributeur.\n\nLes « revendications de brevet essentielles » sont toutes les\nrevendications de brevets détenues ou contrôlées par le contributeur,\nquelles soient déjà acquises par lui ou acquises subséquemment, qui\npourraient être enfreintes de quelque manière, permises par cette\nLicence, sur la réalisation, lutilisation ou la vente de la version\ncontributive de celui-ci. Aux fins de cette définition, le « contrôle »\ninclue le droit de concéder des sous-licences de brevets dune manière\nconsistante, nécessaire et suffisante, avec les obligations de cette\nLicence.\n\nChaque contributeur vous accorde une licence de brevet non exclusive,\nmondiale et libre de toute royaltie, selon les revendications de brevet\nessentielles, pour réaliser, utiliser, vendre, offrir à la vente,\nimporter et autrement exécuter, modifier et propager les contenus de sa\nversion contributive.\n\nDans les trois paragraphes suivants, une « licence de brevet » désigne\ntous les accords ou engagements exprimés, quel que soit le nom que vous\nlui donnez, de ne pas mettre en vigueur un brevet (telle quune\npermission explicite pour mettre en pratique un brevet, ou un accord\npour ne pas poursuivre un Destinataire pour cause de violation de\nbrevet). « Accorder » une telle licence de brevet à une partie signifie\nconclure un tel accord ou engagement à ne pas faire appliquer le brevet\nà cette partie.\n\nSi vous acheminez un Travail Couvert, dépendant en connaissance dune\nlicence de brevet, et si le Source Correspondant du travail nest pas\ndisponible à quiconque copie, sans frais et suivant les termes de cette\nLicence, à travers un serveur réseau publiquement acessible ou tout\nautre moyen immédiatement accessible, alors vous devez soit (1) rendre\nla Source Correspondante ainsi disponible, soit (2) vous engager à vous\npriver pour vous-même du bénéfice de la licence de brevet pour ce\ntravail particulier, soit (3) vous engager, dune façon consistante\navec les obligations de cette Licence, à étendre la licence de brevet\naux Destinataires de ce travail. « Dépendant en connaissance » signifie\nque vous avez effectivement connaissance que, selon la licence de\nbrevet, votre acheminement du Travail Couvert dans un pays, ou\nlutilisation du Travail Couvert par votre Destinataire dans un pays,\ninfreindrait un ou plusieurs brevets identifiables dans ce pays où vous\navez des raisons de penser quils sont valides.\n\nSi, conformément à ou en liaison avec une même transaction ou un même\narrangement, vous acheminez, ou propagez en procurant un acheminement\nde, un Travail Couvert et accordez une licence de brevet à lune des\nparties recevant le Travail Couvert pour lui permettre dutiliser,\npropager, modifier ou acheminer une copie spécifique du Travail\nCouvert, alors votre accord est automatiquement étendu à tous les\nDestinataires du Travail Couvert et des travaux basés sur celui-ci.\n\nUne licence de brevet est « discriminatoire » si, dans le champ de sa\ncouverture, elle ninclut pas un ou plusieurs des droits qui sont\nspécifiquement accordés selon cette Licence, ou en prohibe lexercice,\nou est conditionnée par le non-exercice dun ou plusieurs de ces\ndroits. Vous ne pouvez pas acheminer un Travail Couvert si vous êtes\npartie à un arrangement selon lequel une partie tierce exerçant son\nactivité dans la distribution de logiciels et à laquelle vous effectuez\nun paiement fondé sur létendue de votre activité dacheminement du\ntravail, et selon lequel la partie tierce accorde, à une quelconque\npartie qui recevrait depuis vous le Travail Couvert, une licence de\nbrevet discriminatoire (a) en relation avec les copies du Travail\nCouvert acheminées par vous (ou les copies réalisées à partir de ces\ncopies), ou (b) avant tout destinée et en relation avec des produits\nspécifiques ou compilations contenant le Travail Couvert, à moins que\nvous ayez conclu cet arrangement ou que la licence de brevet ait été\naccordée avant le 28 mars 2007.\n\nRien dans cette Licence ne devrait être interprété comme devant exclure\nou limiter toute licence implicite ou dautres moyens de défense à une\ninfraction qui vous seraient autrement disponible selon la loi\napplicable relative aux brevets.\n\n\nArticle 12. Non abandon de la liberté des autres.\n\nSi des conditions vous sont imposées (que ce soit par décision\njudiciaire, par un accord ou autrement) qui contredisent les conditions\nde cette Licence, elles ne vous excusent pas des conditions de cette\nLicence. Si vous ne pouvez pas acheminer un Travail Couvert de façon à\nsatisfaire simulténément vos obligations suivant cette Licence et\ntoutes autres obligations pertinentes, alors en conséquence vous ne\npouvez pas du tout lacheminer. Par exemple, si vous avez un accord sur\ndes termes qui vous obligent à collecter pour le réacheminement des\nroyalties depuis ceux à qui vous acheminez le Programme, la seule façon\nqui puisse vous permettre de satisfaire à la fois à ces termes et ceux\nde cette Licence sera de vous abstenir entièrement dacheminer le\nProgramme.\n\n\nArticle 13. Utilisation avec la Licence Générale Publique Affero GNU.\n\nNonobstant toute autre clause de cette Licence, vous avez la permission\nde lier ou combiner tout Travail Couvert avec un travail placé sous la\nversion 3 de la Licence Générale Publique GNU Affero (GNU Affero\nGeneral Public License) en un seul travail combiné, et dacheminer le\ntravail résultant. Les termes de cette Licence continueront à\nsappliquer à la partie formant un Travail Couvert, mais les\nobligations spéciales de la Licence Générale Publique GNU Affero,\narticle 13, concernant linteraction à travers un réseau sappliqueront\nà la combinaison en tant que telle.\n\n\nArticle 14. Versions révisées de cette License.\n\nLa Free Software Foundation peut publier des versions révisées et/ou\nnouvelles de la Licence Publique Générale GNU (GNU General Public\nLicense) de temps en temps. De telles version nouvelles resteront\nsimilaires dans lesprit avec la présente version, mais peuvent\ndifférer dans le détail afin de traiter de nouveaux problèmes ou\npréoccupations.\n\nChaque version reçoit un numéro de version distinctif. Si le Programme\nindique quune version spécifique de la Licence Publique Générale GNU\n« ou toute version ultérieure » (or any later version) sapplique à\ncelui-ci, vous avez le choix de suivre soit les termes et conditions de\ncette version numérotée, soit ceux de nimporte quelle version publiée\nultérieurement par la Free Software Foundation. Si le Programme\nnindique pas une version spécifique de la Licence Publique Générale\nGNU, vous pouvez choisir lune quelconque des versions qui ont été\npubliées par la Free Software Foundation.\n\nSi le Programme spécifie quun intermédiaire peut décider quelles\nversions futures de la Licence Générale Publique GNU peut être\nutilisée, la déclaration publique dacceptation dune version par cet\nintermédiaire vous autorise à choisir cette version pour le Programme.\n\nDes versions ultérieures de la licence peuvent vous donner des\npermissions additionelles ou différentes. Cependant aucune obligation\nadditionelle nest imposée à lun des auteurs ou titulaires de Droit\ndAuteur du fait de votre choix de suivre une version ultérieure.\n\n\nArticle 15. Déclaration dabsence de garantie.\n\nIL NY A AUCUNE GARANTIE POUR LE PROGRAMME, DANS LES LIMITES PERMISES\nPAR LA LOI APPLICABLE. À MOINS QUE CELA NE SOIT ÉTABLI DIFFÉREMMENT PAR\nÉCRIT, LES PROPRIÉTAIRES DE DROITS ET/OU LES AUTRES PARTIES FOURNISSENT\nLE PROGRAMME « EN LÉTAT » SANS GARANTIE DAUCUNE SORTE, QUELLE SOIT\nEXPRIMÉE OU IMPLICITE, CECI COMPRENANT, SANS SE LIMITER À CELLES-CI,\nLES GARANTIES IMPLICITES DE COMMERCIALISABILITÉ ET DADÉQUATION À UN\nOBJECTIF PARTICULIER. VOUS ASSUMEZ LE RISQUE ENTIER CONCERNANT LA\nQUALITÉ ET LES PERFORMANCES DU PROGRAMME. DANS LÉVENTUALITÉ OÙ LE\nPROGRAMME SAVÉRERAIT DÉFECTUEUX, VOUS ASSUMEZ LES COÛTS DE TOUS LES\nSERVICES, RÉPARATIONS OU CORRECTIONS NÉCESSAIRES.\n\n\nArticle 16. Limitation de responsabilité.\n\nEN AUCUNE AUTRE CIRCONSTANCE QUE CELLES REQUISES PAR LA LOI APPLICABLE\nOU ACCORDÉES PAR ÉCRIT, UN TITULAIRE DE DROITS SUR LE PROGRAMME, OU\nTOUT AUTRE PARTIE QUI MODIFIE OU ACHEMINE LE PROGRAMME COMME PERMIS\nCI-DESSUS, NE PEUT ÊTRE TENU POUR RESPONSABLE ENVERS VOUS POUR LES\nDOMMAGES, INCLUANT TOUT DOMMAGE GÉNÉRAL, SPÉCIAL, ACCIDENTEL OU INDUIT\nSURVENANT PAR SUITE DE LUTILISATION OU DE LINCAPACITÉ DUTILISER LE\nPROGRAMME (Y COMPRIS, SANS SE LIMITER À CELLES-CI, LA PERTE DE DONNÉES\nOU LINEXACTITUDE DES DONNÉES RETOURNÉES OU LES PERTES SUBIES PAR VOUS\nOU DES PARTIES TIERCES OU LINCAPACITÉ DU PROGRAMME À FONCTIONNER AVEC\nTOUT AUTRE PROGRAMME), MÊME SI UN TEL TITULAIRE OU TOUTE AUTRE PARTIE\nA ÉTÉ AVISÉ DE LA POSSIBILITÉ DE TELS DOMMAGES.\n\n\nArticle 17. Interprétation des sections 15 et 16.\n\nSi la déclaration dabsence de garantie et la limitation de\nresponsabilité fournies ci-dessus ne peuvent prendre effet localement\nselon leurs termes, les cours de justice qui les examinent doivent\nappliquer la législation locale qui approche au plus près possible une\nlevée absolue de toute responsabilité civile liée au Programme, à moins\nquune garantie ou assumation de responsabilité accompagne une copie du\nProgramme en échange dun paiement.\n\n\nFIN DES TERMES ET CONDITIONS.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n\nComment appliquer ces termes à vos nouveaux programmes\n\nSi vous développez un nouveau programme et voulez quil soit le plus\npossible utilisable par le public, la meilleure façon dy parvenir et\nden faire un logiciel libre que chacun peut redistribuer et changer\nsuivant ces termes-ci.\n\nPour appliquer ces termes, attachez les notices suivantes au programme.\nIl est plus sûr de les attacher au début de chacun des fichiers sources\nafin de transporter de façon la plus effective possible lexclusion de\ngarantie ; et chaque fichier devrait comporter au moins la ligne de\nréservation de droit (copyright) et une indication permettant de savoir\noù la notice complète peut être trouvée :\n\n  <une ligne donnant le nom du programme et une brève idée de ce quil fait.>\n  Copyright (C) <année> <nom de lauteur>  Tous droits réservés.\n  \n  Ce programme est un logiciel libre ; vous pouvez le redistribuer ou le\n  modifier suivant les termes de la GNU General Public License telle que\n  publiée par la Free Software Foundation : soit la version 3 de cette\n  licence, soit (à votre gré) toute version ultérieure.\n  \n  Ce programme est distribué dans lespoir quil vous sera utile, mais SANS\n  AUCUNE GARANTIE : sans même la garantie implicite de COMMERCIALISABILITÉ\n  ni dADÉQUATION À UN OBJECTIF PARTICULIER. Consultez la Licence Générale\n  Publique GNU pour plus de détails.\n  \n  Vous devriez avoir reçu une copie de la Licence Générale Publique GNU avec\n  ce programme ; si ce nest pas le cas, consultez :\n  <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAjoutez également les informations permettant de vous contacter par\ncourrier électronique ou postal.\n\nSi le programme produit une interaction sur un terminal, faites lui\nafficher une courte notice comme celle-ci lors de son démarrage en mode\ninteractif :\n\n  <programme> Copyright (C) <année> <nom de lauteur>\n  Ce programme vient SANS ABSOLUMENT AUCUNE GARANTIE ; taper affiche g pour\n  les détails. Ceci est un logiciel libre et vous êtes invité à le redistribuer\n  suivant certaines conditions ; taper affiche c pour les détails.\n\nLes commandes hypothétiques affiche g and affiche c devrait\nafficher les parties appropriées de la Licence Générale Publique. Bien\nsûr, les commandes de votre programme peuvent être différentes ; pour\nune interface graphique, vous pourriez utiliser une « boîte À propos. »\n\nVous devriez également obtenir de votre employeur (si vous travaillez\nen tant que programmeur) ou de votre école un « renoncement aux droits\nde propriété » pour ce programme, si nécessaire. Pour plus\ndinformations à ce sujet, et comment appliquer la GPL GNU, consultez\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nLa Licence Générale Publique GNU ne permet pas dincorporer votre\nprogramme dans des programmes propriétaires. Si votre programme est une\nbibliothèque de sous-routines, vous pourriez considérer quil serait\nplus utile de permettre de lier des applications propriétaires avec la\nbibliothèque. Si cest ce que vous voulez faire, utilisez la Licence\nGénérale Publique Limitée GNU au lieu de cette Licence ; mais dabord,\nveuillez lire <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n"
