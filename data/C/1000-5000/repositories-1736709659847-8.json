There are only just a few left. I want to still maintain and develop sc-im, but I am the only income in my family and its becoming difficult to work as much as I would want.\nIf you can make a donation (see at the bottom), please do. Your help would be really appreciated!!\nThanks.\n\n# sc-im\nSpreadsheet Calculator Improvised, aka sc-im, is an ncurses based, vim-like spreadsheet calculator.\n\nsc-im is based on [sc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc_(spreadsheet_calculator)), whose original authors are James Gosling and Mark Weiser, and mods were later added by Chuck Martin.\n\n## Some of the features of sc-im\n\n- Vim movements commands for editing cell content.\n- UNDO / REDO.\n- 65.536 rows and 702 columns supported. (The number of rows can be expanded to 1.048.576 if wished).\n- CSV / TAB delimited / XLSX file import and export. ODS import. Markdown export.\n- Key-mappings.\n- Autobackup.\n- Direct color support - specifing the RGB values, screen colors can be customized by user, even at runtime.\n- Colorize cells or give them format such as bold, italic or underline.\n- Wide character support.

The file should be placed in the `~/.config/sc-im` directory.\n\nHere is an example `~/.config/sc-im/scimrc` :\n\n    set autocalc\n    set numeric\n    set numeric_decimal=0\n    set overlap\n    set xlsx_readformulas\n\nOther configuration variables are listed in the [help file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/freeze/src/doc).\n\n### Issues and questions\nPlease open an issue if you find a bug.\nIf you are now sure if its a bug, please take a look at the discussions and/or ask there.\nIf you have a question please check out current discussions and if you still are in doubt, open a discussion as well.\nIf you want to ask for a feature request, the same, check out current discussions.\nThank you!\n\n### Tutorial\n\n[sc-im tutorial](https://github.com/jonnieey/Sc-im-Tutorial)\n\n### Related projects\n\n- [vim-scimark](https://github.com/mipmip/vim-scimark) - Vim plugin, edit embedded markdown tables with sc-im in vim terminal.\n\n### Helping us\n\nWant to help?  You can help us with one or more of the following:\n\n* giving sc-im a star on GitHub\n* taking screenshots / creating screencasts showing sc-im\n* making a donation (see below).\n* telling if you use it / like it. I really don't have a clue if this app is used by someone.\n\n### Donations\n\nIf you like sc-im please support its development by making a DONATION with Patreon or PayPal.\nIt would really help a lot.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=U537V8SNQQ45J\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif\" />\n</a>\n\nIf you wish to make a donation, please click the above button or just send money to scim.spreadsheet@gmail.com via PayPal, choosing \"Goods and Services\".\nor with Patreon.\n\nThank you!\n"
