OpenMV cameras are programmable in Python3 and come with an extensive set of machine learning and image processing functions such as face detection, keypoints descriptors, color tracking, QR and Bar code decoding, AprilTags, GIF and MJPEG recording, and more.\n\nThe OpenMV Cam comes with a cross-platform IDE (based on Qt Creator) designed specifically to support programmable cameras. The IDE allows viewing the camera's frame buffer, accessing sensor controls, uploading scripts to the camera via serial over USB (or WiFi/BLE if available) and includes a set of image processing tools to generate tags, thresholds, keypoints, and etc...\n<p align=\"center\"><img width=\"320\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openmv/openmv-media/master/boards/openmv-cam/v3/web-new-cam-v3-angle.jpg\"></p>\n\nThe first generation of OpenMV cameras is based on STM32 ARM Cortex-M Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and OmniVision sensors. The boards have built-in RGB and IR LEDs, USB FS support for programming and video streaming, a uSD socket, and I/O headers breaking out PWM, UARTs, SPI, I2C, CAN, and more. Additionally, the OpenMV Cam supports extension modules (shields) using the I/O headers for adding a WiFi adapter, a LCD Display, a Thermal Vision Sensor, a Motor Driver, and more.\nThe OpenMV project was successfully funded via Kickstarter back in 2015 and has come a long way since then. For more information, please visit [https://openmv.io](https://openmv.io)\n\n## TensorFlow support\nThe OpenMV firmware supports loading quantized TensorFlow Lite models. The firmware supports loading external models that reside on the filesystem to memory (on boards with SDRAM), and internal models (embedded into the firmware) in place. To load an external TensorFlow model from the filesystem from Python use [`tf`](https://docs.openmv.io/library/omv.tf.html) Python module. For information on embedding TensorFlow models into the firmware, and loading them, please see [TensorFlow Support](https://github.com/openmv/openmv/blob/master/src/lib/libtf/README.md).\n\n## Interface library\n\nThe OpenMV Cam comes built-in with an RPC (Remote Python/Procedure Call) library which makes it easy to connect the OpenMV Cam to your computer, a SBC (single board computer) like the RaspberryPi or Beaglebone, or a microcontroller like the Arduino or ESP8266/32. The RPC Interface Library works over:\n\n* Async Serial (UART) - at up **7.5 Mb/s** on the OpenMV Cam H7.\n* I2C Bus - at up to **1 Mb/s** on the OpenMV Cam H7.\n  * Using 1K pull up resistors.\n* SPI Bus - at up to **20 Mb/s** on the OpenMV Cam H7.\n  * Up to **80 Mb/s** or **40 Mb/s** is achievable with short enough wires.\n* CAN Bus - at up to **1 Mb/s** on the OpenMV Cam H7.\n* USB Virtual COM Port (VCP) - at up to **12 Mb/s** on the OpenMV Cam M4/M7/H7.\n* WiFi using the [WiFi Shield](https://openmv.io/collections/shields/products/wifi-shield-1) - at up to **12 Mb/s** on the OpenMV Cam M4/M7/H7.\n\nWith the RPC Library you can easily get image processing results, stream RAW or JPG image data, or have the OpenMV Cam control another Microcontroller for lower-level hardware control like driving motors.\n\nYou can find examples that run on the OpenMV Cam under `File->Examples->Remote Control` in OpenMV IDE and online [here](scripts/examples/34-Remote-Control). Finally, OpenMV provides the following libraries for interfacing your OpenMV Cam to other systems below:\n\n* [Generic Python Interface Library for USB VCP, Ethernet/WiFi, UART, Kvarser CAN, and I2C/SPI Comms](tools/rpc/README.md)\n  * Provides Python code for connecting your OpenMV Cam to a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer (or RaspberryPi/Beaglebone, etc.).\n    * Supports USB VCP on all systems. E.g. direct USB connection to the OpenMV Cam.\n    * Supports Ethernet/WiFi on all systems.\n    * Supports RS232/RS422/RS485/TTL UARTs on all systems. E.g. the old school DB9 port on the back of a PC, USB to serial RS232/RS422/RS485/TTL adapters, and TTL serial on I/O pins on SBCs like the RaspberryPi/Beaglebone.\n    * Supports Kvarser CAN on Windows and Linux (Kvarser does not support Mac).\n    * Supports I2C/SPI on Linux SBCs like the RaspberryPi/Beaglebone, etc. (coming soon)\n* [Arduino Interface Library for CAN, I2C, SPI, UART Comms](https://github.com/openmv/openmv-arduino-rpc)\n  * Works on all Arduino variants.\n  * CAN support via the MCP2515 over SPI or via the CAN peripheral on the ESP32.\n\n#### Note on serial port\n\nIf you only need to read `print()` output from a script running on an OpenMV camera over USB, then you only need to open the OpenMV camera Virtual COM Port and read lines of text from the serial port. For example (using [pyserial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/index.html)):\n\n```Python\nimport serial\nser = serial.Serial(\"COM3\", timeout=1, dsrdtr=False)\nwhile True:\n    line = ser.readline().strip()\n    if line: print(line)\n```\nThe above code works for Windows, Mac, or Linux. You just need to change the above port name to the same name of the USB VCP port the OpenMV Cam shows up as (it will be under `/dev/` on Mac or Linux). Note that if you are opening the USB VCP port using another serial library and/or language make sure to set the DTR line to false - otherwise the OpenMV Cam will suppress printed output.\n\n## Building the firmware from source\n\nThe easiest way to patch the firmware and rebuild it, is to fork this repository, enable Actions (from the Actions tab) in the forked repository, and pushing the changes. Our GitHub workflow rebuilds the firmware on pushes to the master branch and/or merging pull requests and generates a development release with attached separate firmware packages per supported board. For more complex changes, and building the OpenMV firmware from source locally, see [Building the Firmware From Source](https://github.com/openmv/openmv/blob/master/src/README.md).\n\n## Contributing to the project\n\nContributions are most welcome. If you are interested in contributing to the project, start by creating a fork of each of the following repositories:\n\n* https://github.com/openmv/openmv.git\n* https://github.com/openmv/micropython.git\n\nClone the forked openmv repository, and add a remote to the main openmv repository:\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/<username>/openmv.git\ngit -C openmv remote add upstream https://github.com/openmv/openmv.git\n```\n\nSet the `origin` remote of the micropython submodule to the forked micropython repo:\n```bash\ngit -C openmv/src/micropython remote set-url origin https://github.com/<username>/micropython.git\n```\n\nFinally add a remote to openmv's micropython fork:\n```bash\ngit -C openmv/src/micropython remote add upstream https://github.com/openmv/micropython.git\n```\n\nNow the repositories are ready for pull requests. To send a pull request, create a new feature branch and push it to origin, and use Github to create the pull request from the forked repository to the upstream openmv/micropython repository. For example:\n```bash\ngit checkout -b <some_branch_name>\n<commit changes>\ngit push origin -u <some_branch_name>\n```\n\n### Contribution guidelines\nPlease follow the [best practices](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/modify/contribute/write_a_good_pr) when sending pull requests upstream. In general, the pull request should:\n* Fix one problem. Don't try to tackle multiple issues at once.\n* Split the changes into logical groups using git commits.\n* Pull request title should be less than 78 characters, and match this pattern:\n  * `<scope>:<1 space><description><.>`\n* Commit subject line should be less than 78 characters, and match this pattern:\n  * `<scope>:<1 space><description><.>`\n\nExample PR titles or commit subject lines:\n```\ngithub: Update workflows.\nLibtf: Add support for built-in models.\nRPC library: Remove CAN bit timing function.\nOPENMV4: Add readme template file.\nports/stm32/main.c: Fix storage label.\n```\n\n### Licensing\n\nMost of the code in the repository is licensed under the MIT license, with the following exceptions:\n\n* Some image library code is licensed under the GPL. This includes AGAST, LSD, and ZBAR. GPL code can be completely disabled in a build by defining `OMV_NO_GPL` in the `imlib_config.h` files.\n* Third-party libraries and drivers in `src/lib` and `src/drivers` are licensed under various permissive licenses. Please consult the LICENSE file in each driver/library subdirectory for more details.\n* Some drivers, modules, and libraries in OpenMV are proprietary and available for non-commercial use only.
