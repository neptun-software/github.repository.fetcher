          "content": "                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

Thus, you are free of:\n  * manually instrumenting your code (Ctrl-C a long running command line script is even supported).\n  * using a dedicated browser extension or command line launcher.\n* [multi metrics](#available-metrics) capable: 22 are currently supported (various time & memory metrics, included files, objects in use, I/O...).\n* able to collect data without losing context. For example Xhprof (and potentially its forks) aggregates data per caller / callee pairs, which implies the loss of the full call stack and forbids timeline or Flamegraph based analysis.\n* shipped with its [web UI](#web-ui) which allows to:\n  * enable / configure profiling for the current browser session\n  * list profiled script reports\n  * select a report for in-depth analysis, featuring these interactive visualizations:\n    * timeline (scale to millions of function calls)\n    * flat profile\n    * Flamegraph\n\n## Requirements\n\nPlatforms support is currently quite limited. Feel free to open an issue if your platform is not supported.\nCurrent requirements are:\n\n* x86-64 or ARM64\n* **GNU/Linux**, **macOS** or **FreeBSD**\n* zlib dev package (e.g. zlib1g-dev on Debian based distros)\n* PHP 5.4 to 8.4\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* PHP development package (corresponding to your installed PHP version).\n* zlib development package:\n  * For Debian based distros (including Ubuntu, Kubuntu...), just run: `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev`.\n  * For Fedora based distros (including CentOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux...), just run: `sudo dnf install zlib-devel`.\n\n### Install the extension\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/php-spx.git\ncd php-spx\ngit checkout release/latest\nphpize\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nThen add `extension=spx.so` to your *php.ini*, or in a dedicated *spx.ini* file created within the include directory.\nYou may also want to override [default SPX configuration](#configuration) to be able to profile a web request, with [this one](#private-environment) for example for a local development environment.\n\n\n### ZTS PHP (multi-thread)\n\nZTS PHP is supported, with these extra limitations:\n- a little overhead (theorically unnoticeable in most cases) is added when SPX is loaded, even if it is not enabled.\n- Ctrl-C a CLI script will not make the possible profiling session to be properly finished.\n- segfaults are more likely than for NTS PHP. In this regard, avoid more than ever mixing SPX with other instrumenting extensions (debuggers, profilers...).\n\nAlso, consider ZTS PHP support as still being in beta.\n\n### Linux, PHP-FPM & I/O stats\n\nOn GNU/Linux, SPX uses procfs (i.e. by reading files under `/proc` directory) to get some stats for the current process or thread. This is what is done under the hood when you select at least one of these metrics: `mor`, `io`, `ior` or `iow`.\n\nBut, on most PHP-FPM setups, you will have a permission issue preventing SPX to open a file under `/proc/self` directory.\nThis is due to the fact that PHP-FPM master process runs as root when child processes run as another unprivileged user.\n\nWhen this is the case, the `process.dumpable = yes` line must be added to the FPM pool configuration so that child processes will be able to read any file under `/proc/self`.\n\n## Development status\n\nThis is still **experimental**. API might change, features might be added or dropped, or development could be frozen.\n\nYou can still safely use it in a **non-production** environment.\n\nContributions are welcome but be aware of the experimental status of this project and **please follow the contribution rules** described here: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Basic usage\n\n### web request\n\nAssuming a development environment with the configuration [described here](#private-environment) and your application is accessible via `http://localhost`.\n\nJust open with your browser the following URL: `http://localhost/?SPX_KEY=dev&SPX_UI_URI=/` to access to the web UI [control panel](#control-panel).\n\n_N.B.: `http://localhost/` must be served by a PHP script through standard web server feature like directory index or URL rewriting. The PHP script will however not be executed, SPX will intercept and disable its execution to serve its content in place._\n\n_If you see only a blank page then make sure to set `zlib.output_compression = 0` in your PHP configuration file_\n\nYou will then see the following form:\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/93baabbcba04223586d06756dbcecfbd6ec1293d/php-spx/doc/cp-form.png)\n\nThen switch on \"Enabled\". At this point profiling is enabled for the current domain and your current browser session through a set of dedicated cookies.\n\nProfiling can also be triggered with Curl as shown in this example:\n\n`curl --cookie \"SPX_ENABLED=1; SPX_KEY=dev\" http://localhost/`\n\n_N.B.: You can also enable the profiling at INI configuration level via the `spx.http_profiling_enabled` [setting](#configuration), and therefore for all HTTP requests. However, keep in mind that using this setting on a high-traffic environment could quickly exhaust the storage device's capacity of the SPX's data directory._\n\nThen refresh the web request you want to profile and refresh the control panel to see the generated report in the list below the control panel form.\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/d8a90827d6eb256f49d580de448b6b6fad4119ac/php-spx/doc/cp-list2.png)\n\nThen click on the report in the list and enjoy the [analysis screen](#analysis-screen).\n\n### Command line script\n\n#### Instant flat profile\n\nJust prepend your command line with `SPX_ENABLED=1` to trigger profiling. You will get the flat profile printed on STDERR at the end of the execution, even if you abort it by hitting Ctrl-C, as in the following example:\n\n```shell\n$ SPX_ENABLED=1 composer update\nLoading composer repositories with package information\nUpdating dependencies (including require-dev)\n^C\n*** SPX Report ***\n\nGlobal stats:\n\n  Called functions    :    27.5K\n  Distinct functions  :      714\n\n  Wall time           :    7.39s\n  ZE memory           :   62.6MB\n\nFlat profile:\n\n Wall time           | ZE memory           |\n Inc.     | *Exc.    | Inc.     | Exc.     | Called   | Function\n----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\n  101.6ms |  101.6ms |   41.8MB |   41.8MB |       12 | Composer\\Json\\JsonFile::parseJson\n   53.6ms |   53.6ms |     544B |     544B |        4 | Composer\\Cache::sha256\n    6.91s |   41.5ms |   41.5MB |   -7.5MB |        4 | Composer\\Repository\\ComposerRepository::fetchFile\n    6.85s |   32.3ms |   47.5MB |    5.4MB |        5 | 1@Composer\\Repository\\ComposerRepository::loadProviderListings\n    7.8ms |    7.8ms |       0B |       0B |        4 | Composer\\Cache::write\n    1.1ms |    1.1ms |     -72B |     -72B |        1 | Composer\\Console\\Application::Composer\\Console\\{closure}\n  828.5us |  828.5us |     976B |     976B |       12 | Composer\\Util\\RemoteFilesystem::findHeaderValue\n  497.6us |  491.0us |  710.2KB |  710.2KB |        1 | Composer\\Cache::read\n    2.4ms |  332.6us |   20.9KB | -378.8KB |       34 | 3@Symfony\\Component\\Finder\\Iterator\\FilterIterator::rewind\n  298.9us |  298.9us |    2.2KB |    2.2KB |       47 | Symfony\\Component\\Finder\\Iterator\\FileTypeFilterIterator::accept\n```\n\nN.B.: Just add `SPX_FP_LIVE=1` to enable the live refresh of the flat profile during script execution.\n\n#### Generate profiling report for the web UI\n\nYou just have to specify `SPX_REPORT=full` to generate a report available via the web UI:\n\n```shell\nSPX_ENABLED=1 SPX_REPORT=full ./bin/console cache:clear\n```\n\n\n#### Handle long-living / daemon processes\n\nIf your CLI script is long-living and/or daemonized (e.g. via supervisord), profiling its whole lifespan could be meaningless. This is especially true in case of a service waiting for tasks to process.  \nTo handle this case, SPX allows to disable the automatic start of profiling and exposes 2 userland functions, `spx_profiler_start(): void` & `spx_profiler_stop(): ?string`, in order to respectively control the start and the end of the profiled spans.  \n\nHere is how you can instrument your script:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nwhile ($task = get_next_ready_task()) {\n  spx_profiler_start();\n  try {\n    $task->process();\n  } finally {\n    spx_profiler_stop();\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd of course this script must be run at least with profiling enabled and the automatic start disabled as in the following command:\n\n```shell\nSPX_ENABLED=1 SPX_REPORT=full SPX_AUTO_START=0 my_script.php\n```\n\nAutomatic start can also be disabled for web requests via the `spx.http_profiling_auto_start` INI parameter or via the control panel.\n\n\nSide notes:\n- `spx_profiler_start()` and `spx_profiler_stop()` can safely be nested.\n- when profiling with the _full_ report type, `spx_profiler_stop()` returns the report key so that you will be able to store it somewhere, for instance among other information related to the profiled span. With the report key you can build the analysis screen URL which ends with this pattern `/?SPX_UI_URI=/report.html&key=<report key>`.  \n- in CLI context, when automatic start is disabled, no signal handlers (i.e. on SIGINT/SIGTERM) are registered by SPX.\n\n\n#### Add custom metadata to the current full report\n\nWhen profiling with _full_ report as output, it could be handy to add custom metadata to the current report so that you will be able to easily retrieve it or differentiate it from other similar reports.\n\nThis is especially true for the long-living process use case which otherwise would not allow to differentiate a report from other ones of the same process.\n\nTo do that SPX exposes the `spx_profiler_full_report_set_custom_metadata_str(string $customMetadataStr): void` function.\n\nAs you may have notificed, this function accepts a string as custom metadata, for the sake of flexibility and simplicity on SPX side. It is up to you to encode any structured data to a string, for instance using JSON format.\n\nThe metadata string is limited to 4KB, which is large enough for most use cases. If you pass a string exceeding this limit it will be discarded and a notice log will be emitted.\n\nThis string will be stored among other current report's metadata and you will retrieve it in the report list on web UI side.\n\n`spx_profiler_full_report_set_custom_metadata_str()` can be called at any moment as long as the profiler is already started and not finished yet, which means:\n- at any moment during the script execution when automatic start is enabled (default mode).\n- at any moment after the call of `spx_profiler_start()` and before the call of `spx_profiler_stop()` when automatic start is disabled.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nwhile ($task = get_next_ready_task()) {\n  spx_profiler_start();\n\n  spx_profiler_full_report_set_custom_metadata_str(json_encode(\n    [\n      'taskId' => $task->getId(),\n    ]\n  ));\n\n  try {\n    $task->process();\n  } finally {\n    spx_profiler_stop();\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Configuration\n\n| Name                  | Default  | Changeable  | Description  |\n| --------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ |\n| _spx.data_dir_     | `/tmp/spx` | _PHP_INI_SYSTEM_ | The directory where profiling reports will be stored. You may change it to point to a shared file system for example in case of multi-server architecture.  |\n| _spx.http_enabled_      | `0`  | _PHP_INI_SYSTEM_ | Whether to enable web UI and HTTP request profiling. |\n| _spx.http_key_          |  | _PHP_INI_SYSTEM_ | The secret key used for authentication (see [security concern](#security-concern) for more details). You can use the following command to generate a 16 bytes random key as an hex string: `openssl rand -hex 16`. |\n| _spx.http_ip_var_       | `REMOTE_ADDR` | _PHP_INI_SYSTEM_ | The `$_SERVER` key holding the client IP address used for authentication (see [security concern](#security-concern) for more details). Overriding the default value is required when your application is behind a reverse proxy. |\n| _spx.http_trusted_proxies_       | `127.0.0.1` | _PHP_INI_SYSTEM_ | The trusted proxy list as a comma separated list of IP addresses<b>*</b>. This setting is ignored when `spx.http_ip_var`'s value is `REMOTE_ADDR`. |\n| _spx.http_ip_whitelist_ |  | _PHP_INI_SYSTEM_ | The IP address white list used for authentication as a comma separated list of IP addresses<b>*</b>. |\n| _spx.http_ui_assets_dir_ | `/usr/local/share/misc/php-spx/assets/web-ui` | _PHP_INI_SYSTEM_ | The directory where the [web UI](#web-ui) files are installed. In most cases you do not have to change it. |\n| _spx.http_profiling_enabled_ | _NULL_ | _PHP_INI_SYSTEM_ | The INI level counterpart of the `SPX_ENABLED` parameter, for HTTP requests only. See [here for more details](#available-parameters). |\n| _spx.http_profiling_auto_start_ | _NULL_ | _PHP_INI_SYSTEM_ | The INI level counterpart of the `SPX_AUTO_START` parameter, for HTTP requests only.

See [here for more details](#available-parameters). |\n\n_\\*: `*` (match all) and subnet masks (e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`) are supported._\n\n#### Private environment\n\nFor your local & private development environment, since there is no need for authentication, you can use this configuration:\n\n```\nspx.http_enabled=1\nspx.http_key=\"dev\"\nspx.http_ip_whitelist=\"127.0.0.1\"\n```\n\nAnd then access to the web UI at `http(s)://<your application host>/?SPX_KEY=dev&SPX_UI_URI=/`.\n\n### Available metrics\n\nHere is the list of available metrics to collect. By default only _Wall time_ and _Zend Engine memory usage_ are collected.\n\n| Key (command line) | Name | Description |\n| ---- | ---------------- | ------ |\n| _wt_ | Wall time | The absolute elapsed time. |\n| _ct_ | CPU time | The time spent while running on CPU. |\n| _it_ | Idle time | The time spent off-CPU, that means waiting for CPU, I/O completion, a lock acquisition... or explicitly sleeping. |\n| _zm_ | Zend Engine memory usage | Equivalent to `memory_get_usage(false)`. |\n| _zmac_ | Zend Engine allocation count | Number of memory allocations (i.e. allocated blocks) performed. |\n| _zmab_ | Zend Engine allocated bytes<b>*</b> | Number of allocated bytes. |\n| _zmfc_ | Zend Engine free count | Number of memory releases (i.e. freed blocks) performed. |\n| _zmfb_ | Zend Engine freed bytes<b>*</b> | Number of freed bytes. |\n| _zgr_ | Zend Engine GC run count | Number of times the GC (cycle collector) have been triggered (either manually or automatically). |\n| _zgb_ | Zend Engine GC root buffer length | Root buffer length, see explanation [here](http://php.net/manual/en/features.gc.collecting-cycles.php). It could be helpful to track pressure on garbage collector. |\n| _zgc_ | Zend Engine GC collected cycle count | Total number of collected cycles through all GC runs. |\n| _zif_ | Zend Engine included file count | Number of included files. |\n| _zil_ | Zend Engine included line count | Number of included lines. |\n| _zuc_ | Zend Engine user class count | Number of userland classes. |\n| _zuf_ | Zend Engine user function count | Number of userland functions (including userland class/instance methods). |\n| _zuo_ | Zend Engine user opcode count | Number of included userland opcodes (sum of all userland file/function/method opcodes). |\n| _zo_ | Zend Engine object count | Number of objects currently held by user code. |\n| _ze_ | Zend Engine error count | Number of raised PHP errors. |\n| _mor_ | Process's own RSS<b>\\*\\*</b> | The part of the process's memory held in RAM. The shared (with other processes) memory blocks are not taken into account. This metric can be useful to highlight a memory leak within a PHP extension or deeper (e.g. a third-party C library). |\n| _io_ | I/O (reads + writes)**\\*\\*** | Bytes read or written while performing I/O. |\n| _ior_ | I/O (reads)**\\*\\*** | Bytes read while performing I/O. |\n| _iow_ | I/O (writes)**\\*\\*** | Bytes written while performing I/O. |\n\n_\\*: Allocated and freed byte counts will not be collected if you use a custom allocator or if you force the libc one through the `USE_ZEND_ALLOC` environment variable set to `0`._\n\n_\\*\\*: RSS & I/O metrics are not supported on macOS and FreeBSD. On GNU/Linux you should [read this if you use PHP-FPM](#linux-php-fpm--io-stats)._\n\n### Command line script\n\n#### Available report types\n\nContrary to web request profiling which only support _full_ report type (the one exploitable by the web UI), command line script profiling supports several types of report.\nHere is the list below:\n\n| Key  | Name  | Description  |\n| ---- | ----- | ------------ |\n| _fp_ | Flat profile | The flat profile provided by SPX. It is the **default report type** and is directly printed on STDERR. |\n| _full_ | Full report | This is the report type for web UI. Reports will be stored in SPX data directory and thus will be available for analysis on web UI side. |\n| _trace_ | Trace file | A custom format (human readable text) trace file. |\n\n#### Available parameters\n\n| Name  | Default  | Description  |\n| ----- | -------- | ------------ |\n| _SPX_ENABLED_ | `0` | Whether to enable SPX profiler (i.e. triggering profiling). When disabled there is no performance impact on your application (except for ZTS PHP where a disabled SPX still adds a little overhead). |\n| _SPX_AUTO_START_ | `1` | Whether to enable SPX profiler's automatic start. When automatic start is disabled, you have to start & stop profiling on your own at runtime via the `spx_profiler_start()` & `spx_profiler_stop()` functions. [See here](#handle-long-living--daemon-processes) for more details. |\n| _SPX_BUILTINS_ | `0` | Whether to profile internal functions, script compilations, GC runs and request shutdown. |\n| _SPX_DEPTH_ | `0` | The stack depth at which profiling must stop (i.e. aggregate measures of deeper calls). 0 (default value) means unlimited. |\n| _SPX_SAMPLING_PERIOD_ | `0` | Whether to collect data for the current call stack at regular intervals according to the specified sampling period (`0` means no sampling). The result will usually be less accurate but in some cases it could be far more accurate by not over-evaluating small functions called many times. It is recommended to try sampling (with different periods) if you want to accurately find a time bottleneck. When profiling a long running & CPU intensive script, this option will allow you to contain report size and thus keeping it small enough to be exploitable by the [web UI](#web-ui). See [here](#performance-report-size--sampling) for more details. |\n| _SPX_METRICS_ | `wt,zm` | Comma separated list of [available metric keys](#available-metrics) to collect. All report types take advantage of multi-metric profiling. |\n| _SPX_REPORT_ | `fp` | Selected [report key](#available-report-types). |\n| _SPX_FP_FOCUS_ | `wt` | [Metric key](#available-metrics) for flat profile sort. |\n| _SPX_FP_INC_ | `0` | Whether to sort functions by inclusive value instead of exclusive value in flat profile. |\n| _SPX_FP_REL_ | `0` | Whether to display metric values as relative (i.e. percentage) in flat profile. |\n| _SPX_FP_LIMIT_ | `10` | The flat profile size (i.e. top N shown functions). |\n| _SPX_FP_LIVE_ | `0` | Whether to enable flat profile live refresh. Since it plays with cursor position through ANSI escape sequences, it uses STDOUT as output, replacing script output (both STDOUT & STDERR). |\n| _SPX_FP_COLOR_ | `1` | Whether to enable flat profile color mode. |\n| _SPX_TRACE_SAFE_ | `0` | The trace file is by default written in a way to enforce accuracy, but in case of process crash (e.g. segfault) some logs could be lost. If you want to enforce durability (e.g. to find the last event before a crash) you just have to set this parameter to 1. |\n| _SPX_TRACE_FILE_ |  | Custom trace file name. If not specified it will be generated in `/tmp` and displayed on STDERR at the end of the script. |\n\n#### Setting parameters\n\nWell, as you might already noticed in corresponding [basic usage example](#command-line-script), setting a SPX parameter for a command line script simply means setting an environment variable with the same name.\n\n### Web UI\n\n#### Supported browsers\n\nSince the web UI uses advanced JavaScript features, only the following browsers are known to be supported:\n- most recent version of any Chromium-based browser.\n- most recent version of Firefox.\n\n#### Control panel & report list\n\nThis is the home page of the web UI, divided into 2 parts:\n- the control panel for setting the profiling setup for your current browser session.\n- the profile report list as a sortable table. A click on a row allows to go to the [analysis screen](#analysis-screen) for the corresponding report.\n\n#### Analysis screen\n\n[Click here for a live demo of the analysis screen](https://noisebynorthwest.github.io/php-spx/demo/report.html?key=spx-full-20180603_211110-dev-3540-294703905)\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/d8a90827d6eb256f49d580de448b6b6fad4119ac/php-spx/doc/as.th.png)\n\n##### Performance, report size & sampling\n\nThe analysis screen can nicely handle profile reports with up to several (5+) millions of recorded function calls with Chromium on my i5 @ 3.3GHz / 8GB desktop.\nIn case you want to profile a long running, CPU intensive, script which tends to generate giant reports, you can enable sampling mode with the suitable sampling period.\nSee _SPX_SAMPLING_PERIOD_ [parameter](#available-parameters) for command line script.\n\n##### Metric selector\n\nThis is simply a combo box for selecting the currently analyzed metric.\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/d8a90827d6eb256f49d580de448b6b6fad4119ac/php-spx/doc/as-ms.png)\n\n##### Color scheme selector\n\nBy default, function related blocks in the visualizations are colored according to their cost, with a color scale displayed at the top right of the screen.\n\nYou can also define a custom color scheme by clicking on the color scheme mode link, displayed at the top of the screen just after the metric selector.\nA drop-down window will then appear and allow you to switch between `default` and `category` mode and define (add/edit/delete) your categories (color, name, pattern list) for the `category` mode (see the screenshot below).\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/d8a90827d6eb256f49d580de448b6b6fad4119ac/php-spx/doc/as-csm.png)\n\n##### Timeline overview\n\nThis visualization is the timeline overview of all called functions.\nYou can change the selected time range by, represented by a transparent green rectangle, by simply dragging it horizontally.\n\nExcept for wall time, the current metric is also plotted (current value over time) on a foreground layer.\n\nSupported controls:\n- horizontal left click drag: shift the selected time range\n- resize click on selected time range rectangle: shift one of the selected time range boundary\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/d8a90827d6eb256f49d580de448b6b6fad4119ac/php-spx/doc/as-ov.png)\n\n##### Timeline focus\n\nThis visualization is an interactive timeline which is able to control and keep focus on the selected time range.\n\nSupported controls:\n- left click drag: time range shift (horizontal) or depth range shift (vertical)\n- middle click vertical drag: time range zoom in/out\n- mouse wheel: time range zoom in/out\n- hovering a function call to show more details\n- double click on a function call: set the current time range as the one of the selected function call\n\nExcept for wall time, the current metric is also plotted (current value over time) on a foreground layer.\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/d8a90827d6eb256f49d580de448b6b6fad4119ac/php-spx/doc/as-tl.png)\n\n##### Flat profile\n\nThis visualization is the flat profile for the selected time range and the selected metric, displayed as a sortable table.\n\nThe `Inc.` and `Exc.` sub-columns respectively correspond to:\n- the inclusive resource consumption of the function, including its called functions consumption\n- the exclusive resource consumption of the function, excluding its called functions consumption\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/d8a90827d6eb256f49d580de448b6b6fad4119ac/php-spx/doc/as-fp.png)\n\n##### Flame Graph\n\nThis visualization, designed by [Brendan Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html), allows to quickly find the hot code path for the selected time range and the selected metric.\nMetrics corresponding to releasable resources (memory, objects in use...) are not supported by this visualization.\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/d8a90827d6eb256f49d580de448b6b6fad4119ac/php-spx/doc/as-fg.png)\n\n\n##### Function highlighting\n\nYou can highlight a function by clicking on one of its spans within the timeline or Flamegraph widgets or its name within the flat profile widget.\n\n![Showcase](https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/NoiseByNorthwest.github.io/blob/47d8f8d93fad1e6659c46c47e5aa8f82822454a9/php-spx/doc/as-fh.png)\n\n\n## Security concern\n\n_The lack of review / feedback about this concern is the main reason **SPX cannot yet be considered as production ready**._\n\nSPX allows you to profile web request as well as command line scripts, and also to list and analyze profile reports through its embedded web UI.\nThis is why there is a huge security risk, since an attacker could:\n - access to web UI and get sensible information about your application.\n - to a lesser extent, make a DoS attack against your application with a costly profiling setup.\n\nSo, unless access to your application is already restricted at lower layer (i.e. before your application is hit, not by the application / PHP framework itself), a client triggering profiling or accessing to the web UI must be authenticated.\n\nSPX provides two-factor authentication with these 2 mandatory locks:\n* IP address white list (exact string representation matching).\n* Fixed secret random key (generated on your own) provided via a request header, cookie or query string parameter.\n\nThus a client can profile your application via a web request only if **its IP address is white listed and its provided key is valid**.\n\n## Notes on accuracy\n\nIn tracing mode (default), SPX is subject to accuracy issues for time related metrics when the measured function execution time is:\n- close or lower than the timer precision\n- close or lower than SPX's own per function overhead\n\nThe first issue is mitigated by using the highest resolution timer provided by the platform. On Linux, FreeBSD & recent macOS versions the timer resolution is 1ns; on macOS before 10.12/Sierra, the timer resolution is only 1us.\n\nThe second issue is mitigated by taking into account SPX's time (wall / cpu) overhead by subtracting it to measured function execution time. This is done by evaluating SPX constant per function overhead before starting profiling the script.\n\nHowever, whatever the platform, if you want to maximize accuracy to find a time bottleneck, you should also:\n- avoid profiling internal functions.\n- avoid collecting additional metrics.\n- try sampling mode with different sampling periods.\n- try to play with maximum depth parameter to stop profiling at a given depth.\n\n## Stubs\n\nStubs for SPX functions to be used with [Intelephense](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intelephense)\n\n    composer require --dev 8ctopus/php-spx-stubs\n\n## Credits\n\nI have found lot of inspiration and hints reading:\n - [XHProf](https://github.com/phacility/xhprof)\n - [Xdebug](https://github.com/xdebug/xdebug)\n - [PHP](https://github.com/php/php-src)\n\n## License\n\n**SPX** is open source software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL-3).\nSee the [LICENSE][:link-license:] file for more information.\n\n<!-- All external links should be here to avoid duplication and long lines with links -->\n[:badge-ci:]:           https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/php-spx/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg\n[:link-ci:]:            https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/php-spx/actions/workflows/main.yml\n\n[:badge-php-versions:]: https://img.shields.io/badge/php-5.4--8.4-blue.svg\n[:badge-supported-platforms:]: https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-GNU/Linux%20|%20macOS%20|%20FreeBSD%20-yellow\n[:badge-supported-arch:]: https://img.shields.io/badge/architecture-x86--64%20|%20ARM64%20-silver\n\n[:badge-license:]:      https://img.shields.io/github/license/NoiseByNorthwest/php-spx\n[:link-license:]:       https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest/php-spx/blob/master/LICENSE\n"
