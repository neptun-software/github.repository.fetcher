It also updates the `LC_SEGMENT` (or `LC_SEGMENT64`) load command for the `__LINKEDIT` segment from the new file size. If the binary is fat we also update the size and we might also move the slice and so the offset should also be updated.\n\nAfter removing the code signature from the `__LINKEDIT` segment, the last thing in that segment is typically the string table. As the code signature seems to be aligned by `0x10`, and so after removing the code signature, nothing points to the padding at the end of the segment, which `codesign_allocate` doesn't like either. To fix this we just increase the size of the string table in the `LC_SYMTAB` command so it also includes the padding.\n\nTodo\n----\n\n- Improved checking for free space to insert the new load command\n- Allow removal of `LC_CODE_SIGNATURE` if it isn't the last load command\n- Remove `__RESTRICT,__restrict` if not enough space (suggesion by dirkg)"
