Useful for devices with no VPN app support like TV or gaming consoles.\n* Share wifi via QR code\n* MAC filter\n* View connected devices\n* Includes Both command line and GUI.\n* Support both 2.4GHz and 5GHz (Need to be compatible with your wifi adapter). Ex: You have connected to the 5GHz network and share a connection with 2.4GHz.\n* Customise wifi Channel, Change MAC address, etc.\n* Hide SSID\n* customize gateway IP address\n* Enable IEEE 80211n, IEEE 80211ac and IEEE 80211ax modes\n\n![screenshot](docs/sc4.png)\n\n\n### Command line help and documentation\n\nRead [Command line help and documentation here](src/scripts/README.md).\n\nIf you only need the command line without GUI run `make install-cli-only` as the root user.\n\n### Notes\n\n- Sometimes there are troubles with **5Ghz bands** due to some vendor restrictions. If you cannot start the hotspot while you are connected to the 5Ghz band, Unselect **Auto** and select **2.4Ghz** in frequency selection.\n\n- If any problems with **RealTeK Wifi Adapters** see [this](docs/howto/realtek.md)\n\n- **Unable to allocate IP: firewalld issue:** Please check for potential fixes: [#209](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot/issues/209) [#166](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot/issues/166)\n\n## Installation\n\n#### Debian/Ubuntu\n\nDownload the Debian package from the latest [release](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot/releases/latest)\n\n**OR**\nGood news! I was able to restore keys, new versions will be available via the PPA\n```bash\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:lakinduakash/lwh\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install linux-wifi-hotspot\n\n```\n\n#### Arch based distributions\n\nLinux Wifi Hotspot is available as an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-wifi-hotspot/). You can install it manually or with your favorite AUR helper.\nFor example, if you use `yay` you can do:\n`yay -S linux-wifi-hotspot`\n\n### Fedora based distributions\ncopr based repo is available for Fedora \n```bash\nsudo dnf copr enable zinix01/linux-wifi-hotspot\nsudo dnf install linux-wifi-hotspot \n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n#### General\n* bash\n* util-linux (for getopt)\n* procps or procps-ng\n* hostapd\n* iproute2\n* iw\n* iwconfig (you only need this if 'iw' can not recognize your adapter)\n* haveged (optional)\n\n_Make sure you have those dependencies by typing them in terminal. If any of dependencies fail\ninstall it using your distro's package manager_\n\n#### For 'NATed' or 'None' Internet sharing method\n* dnsmasq\n* iptables\n\n#### To build from source\n\n* make\n* gcc and g++\n* build-essential\n* pkg-config\n* gtk\n* libgtk-3-dev\n* libqrencode-dev (for qr code generation)\n* libpng-dev (for qr code generation)\n\nOn Ubuntu or Debian install dependencies by,\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y libgtk-3-dev build-essential gcc g++ pkg-config make hostapd libqrencode-dev libpng-dev\n```\n\nOn Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux/Rocky Linux/Oracle Linux\n```bash\nsudo dnf install -y gtk3-devel gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel pkg-config make hostapd qrencode-devel libpng-devel\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n    git clone https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot\n    cd linux-wifi-hotspot\n\n    #build binaries\n    make\n\n    #install\n    sudo make install\n\n## Uninstallation\n    sudo make uninstall\n\n## Running\nYou can launch the GUI by searching for \"Wifi Hotspot\" in the Application Menu\nor using the terminal with:\n\n    wihotspot\n\n<h2 id=\"vpn-hotspot\">Create VPN Hotspot</h2>\n\nAfter connecting to VPN, Open `wihotspot` GUI. Select the virtual interface created by the VPN. In this case it is `tun0`\n\n![image](docs/vpn.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Run on Startup\nThe `wihotspot` GUI uses `create_ap` to create and manage access points. This service and core logic were originally created by\n[@oblique](http://github.com/oblique), and are now maintained in this\nrepository.\n\nStart the hotspot service on startup (using your saved configuration) with:\n\n    systemctl enable create_ap\n\n\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you found a bug or you have an idea about improving this make an issue.
