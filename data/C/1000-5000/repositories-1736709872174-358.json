          "content": "# Micro Racer Car - StuckAtPrototype\n\n*thank you for the overwhelmingly positve support!! such an inspiration to keep making fun open source content!*\n\n## Youtube Video\nA bit of a back-story of how this project came to be. \n\n[![My Kickstarter failed, so I open sourced it](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6jzG-BMannc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzG-BMannc)\n\nSub if you like what you see.\n\n\n*Some pictures of the project*\n\n![Picture of PCB car](project_pictures/242A0548.png)\n\n![Picture of PCB car](project_pictures/242A1274.png)\n\n## Hardware Remote for this car\n\nhttps://github.com/StuckAtPrototype/Thumbtroller\n\n## Project Structure\nThe project consists of\n1. Firmware\n2. Hardware\n3. Mechanical \n4. Scripts\n\nThese are structured into their own files. I could have used submodules, but decided against it.  \n\n### 1. Firmware\nCode for the little car. This lives on the ESP32\n\n#### Requirements\n- ESP32 IDF version 5.3.1\n- USB to Serial dongle\n- Target set to ESP32-H2\n\n### 2. Hardware\n\n#### Schematic\nPDF schematic included for your viewing pleasure. \n#### PCBs\nAll the gerber files you'd need to send to a fab house. \n#### Kicad\nAll the files you'd need to expand and work on this further. If you'd like. \n\n### 3. Mechanical\n\n#### Enclosure\nAll the step files you need to make one of these. Extrusion printer works well for this part.  \n\n#### Wheels\nA bit of caution on this one.. you'll need an SLA printer. \n\n### 4. Scripts\nDid anyone say neural networks? \n\nThis folder has all the python code you'd need to train up your own neural network for the car. It also consists scripts that let you drive it using a keyboard -- just in case you dont want to make a physical controller.  \n\n#### Requirements\n- Python 3\n- You'll need to install a bunch of pip modules \n\n#### Training the neural network\nTraining the neural network is as simple as running the training script with the data in the `color_data.txt` file. For data format see the sample data in the file. You need to stick to the formatting. \n\nTo train run `python trainer.py`\n\n#### Keyboard controller\nTo run the script `python controller.py`\n\nUse `w` `s` `a` `d` for control. Modify the script for different speeds, etc\n\n*Protocol for motor control* \n\n60,1,60,1,5 -- translates to:\n\nmotor side A: speed 60, direction forward\n\nmotor side B: speed 60, direction forward\n\n500 miliseconds run time\n\nSee firmware file `motor.c` if you need more details\n\n## What the project could use\n1. Cleanup, but thats true for almost anything out there\n2. Some fun code that makes the little car drive using the color sensor -- think very fancy line follower\n3. LLM integration -- ChatGPT driving a physical little robot? anyone? :)\n\n## If you take it further\nLet me know if you ever make one of these, I'd love to see it. Seriously, that'd be exciting and inspiring to keep making my projects open source!\n\n---\n## License\n### Apache 2.0 -- i.e. use as you'd like\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n--- \n## Special Thanks\nThanks to Michael Angerer for his open sourced `esp32_ble_ota` project. I used it to get BLE running in this project. His blog post and github repo are a great resource. Check it out. https://github.com/michael-angerer/esp32_ble_ota \n"
