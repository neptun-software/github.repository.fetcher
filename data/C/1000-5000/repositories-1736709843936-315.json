After reading through the documentation, if\nyou have any questions, please come join us on the\n[ZMK Discord Server][discord-invite].\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nAll community members are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].\nFor any and all conduct inquiries or concerns, please contact conduct@zmk.dev.\n\n[code-of-conduct]: https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n\n## How Can I Contribute\n\nThere are many different ways that you can contribute to ZMK, several of which require no coding\nabilities. These include:\n\n- Chat Support\n- Issue Reporting/Commenting\n- Testing\n- Documentation\n- Code Contributions\n\n## Chat Support\n\nProviding user support on the [ZMK Discord Server][discord-invite] is a great way to help the\nproject. In particular, answering questions in the [#help](https://discord.com/channels/719497620560543766/719909884769992755) channel is incredibly appreciated.\n\n## Issue Reporting/Commenting\n\nOften, you might encounter unexpected behavior when building, flashing, or running the ZMK\nfirmware. Submitting or commenting on issues on GitHub is a great way to contribute to the\nZMK project.\n\n### Before Submitting a Report\n\n- Review the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://zmk.dev/docs/faq).\n- Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://zmk.dev/docs/troubleshooting) for answers.\n- Search the [open issues](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues) for an existing report that\n  matches your problem.\n\n### Opening A Report\n\nTo open a report:\n\n- Head to https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/new\n- Provide an accurate summary of the issue in the title.\n- Provide as much detail as you can about the issue including:\n  - What [board/shield](https://zmk.dev/docs/faq#what-is-a-board) you are using.\n  - A link to the user repository, if you used it to build your firmware.\n  - Exact steps to reproduce the problem.\n  - Any relevant screenshots or [logs](https://zmk.dev/docs/dev-guide-usb-logging)\n\n## Testing\n\nThe `help wanted` label will be added to any [pull requests](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)\nor [issues](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)\nwhere user testing can assist the ZMK contributors to verify fixes, confirm\nbugs, etc.\n\nWhen providing testing feedback, please provide:\n\n- Exact steps used to test\n- Any hardware details relevant to testing\n- Pass/fail summary for testing.\n- Full details of any failures, including:\n  - Logs\n  - Screenshots\n\n## Documentation\n\nQuality documentation is a huge part of what makes a successful project. Contributions to add\ndocumentation to areas not currently covered are greatly appreciated.\n\n### Contributing\n\n- The documentation site can be found in the main ZMK repo, in the\n  [docs/](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/tree/main/docs) subdirectory.\n- The documentation is maintained using [Docusaurus V2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/).\n- To get started, from the `docs/` directory, run `npm ci` and then `npm start`.\n- Enhancements should be submitted as pull requests to the `main` branch of ZMK.\n\n### Formatting\n\nZMK uses `prettier` to format documentation files. You can run prettier with `npm run prettier:format`.\nYou can setup git to run prettier automatically when you commit by installing the pre-commit hooks: `pip3 install pre-commit`, `pre-commit install`.\n\n### Linting\n\nThis repository utilizes ESLint for code linting to ensure consistent code style and identify potential errors or bugs early in the development process.\n\nYou can run ESLint with `npm run lint` to verify your changes.\n\n## Code Contributions\n\n### Development Setup\n\nTo get your development environment setup going, start at the\n[basic setup](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/setup/) docs, and make sure you can build and flash\nyour own locally built firmware.\n\n### Formatting\n\nZMK uses `clang-format` to ensure consist formatting for our source code. Before submitting your\nchanges, make sure you've manually run `clang-format`, or have your IDE configured to auto-format\non save.\n\nYou can setup git to run `clang-format` automatically when you commit by installing the pre-commit hooks: `pip3 install pre-commit`, `pre-commit install`.\n\n### Commit Messages\n\nThe ZMK project is working towards, but not yet enforcing, the use of\n[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.\n\nFurther documentation and details will be provided here soon.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nWhen opening a pull request with your changes, please:\n\n- Submit the PR to the `main` branch of the\n  [`zmkfirmware/zmk`](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) repository.\n- Use a descriptive title that summarizes the change.\n- In the description, include:\n  - References to any open issues fixed by the PR.\n  - Feature added by the PR\n  - Bugs fixed by the PR.\n  - Testing you've performed locally.\n  - Requested testing by reviewers or testers.\n  - Screenshots or logs that support understanding the change.\n\n[discord-invite]: https://zmk.dev/community/discord/invite\n"
