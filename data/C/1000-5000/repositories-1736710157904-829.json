By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"

          "content": "Installation Instructions\n*************************\n\nCopyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005,\n2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\nThis file is free documentation; the Free Software Foundation gives\nunlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.\n\nBasic Installation\n==================\n\nBriefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should\nconfigure, build, and install this package.  The following\nmore-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for\ninstructions specific to this package.\n\n   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for\nvarious system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses\nthose values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.\nIt may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent\ndefinitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that\nyou can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a\nfile `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for\ndebugging `configure').\n\n   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'\nand enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves\nthe results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is\ndisabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale\ncache files.\n\n   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try\nto figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail\ndiffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can\nbe considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at\nsome point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you\nmay remove or edit it.\n\n   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create\n`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if\nyou want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version\nof `autoconf'.\n\nThe simplest way to compile this package is:\n\n  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type\n     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.\n\n     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints\n     some messages telling which features it is checking for.\n\n  2. Type `make' to compile the package.\n\n  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with\n     the package.\n\n  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and\n     documentation.\n\n  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the\n     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the\n     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for\n     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is\n     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly\n     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get\n     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came\n     with the distribution.\n\nCompilers and Options\n=====================\n\nSome systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the\n`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for\ndetails on some of the pertinent environment variables.\n\n   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters\nby setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here\nis an example:\n\n     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix\n\n   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.\n\nCompiling For Multiple Architectures\n====================================\n\nYou can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the\nsame time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their\nown directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the\ndirectory where you want the object files and executables to go and run\nthe `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the\nsource code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.\n\n   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one\narchitecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have\ninstalled the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before\nreconfiguring for another architecture.\n\nInstallation Names\n==================\n\nBy default, `make install' installs the package's commands under\n`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You\ncan specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving\n`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.\n\n   You can specify separate installation prefixes for\narchitecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you\npass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses\nPREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.\nDocumentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.\n\n   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give\noptions like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular\nkinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories\nyou can set and what kinds of files go in them.\n\n   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed\nwith an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the\noption `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.\n\nOptional Features\n=================\n\nSome packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to\n`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.\nThey may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE\nis something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The\n`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the\npackage recognizes.\n\n   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually\nfind the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,\nyou can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and\n`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.\n\nSpecifying the System Type\n==========================\n\nThere may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,\nbut needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.\nUsually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_\narchitectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a\nmessage saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the\n`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system\ntype, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:\n\n     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM\n\nwhere SYSTEM can have one of these forms:\n\n     OS KERNEL-OS\n\n   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If\n`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't\nneed to know the machine type.\n\n   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should\nuse the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will\nproduce code for.\n\n   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a\nplatform different from the build platform, you should specify the\n\"host\" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will\neventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.\n\nSharing Defaults\n================\n\nIf you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you\ncan create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default\nvalues for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.\n`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then\n`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the\n`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.\nA warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.\n\nDefining Variables\n==================\n\nVariables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the\nenvironment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run\nconfigure again during the build, and the customized values of these\nvariables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set\nthem in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:\n\n     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc\n\ncauses the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is\noverridden in the site shell script).\n\nUnfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to\nan Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:\n\n     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash\n\n`configure' Invocation\n======================\n\n`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.\n\n`--help'\n`-h'\n     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.\n\n`--version'\n`-V'\n     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'\n     script, and exit.\n\n`--cache-file=FILE'\n     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,\n     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to\n     disable caching.\n\n`--config-cache'\n`-C'\n     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.\n\n`--quiet'\n`--silent'\n`-q'\n     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To\n     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error\n     messages will still be shown).\n\n`--srcdir=DIR'\n     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually\n     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.\n\n`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run\n`configure --help' for more details.\n\n"

          "content": "MooseFS - A Petabyte Distributed File System\n\nMooseFS is a Petabyte Open Source Network Distributed File System. It is easy\nto deploy and maintain, highly reliable, fault tolerant, highly performing,\neasily scalable and POSIX compliant.\n\nMooseFS spreads data over a number of commodity servers, which are visible\nto the user as one resource. For standard file operations MooseFS acts\nlike ordinary Unix-like file system:\n\n  * A hierarchical structure – directory tree\n  * Stores POSIX file attributes – permissions, last access and modification\n    times, etc.\n  * Supports ACLs\n  * Supports POSIX and BSD file locks – including support for distributed\n    file locking\n  * Supports special files – block and character devices, pipes and sockets\n  * Supports symbolic links – file names pointing to target files,\n    not necessarily on MooseFS\n  * Supports hard links – different names of files which refer to the same\n    data on MooseFS\n\n\nDistinctive MooseFS features:\n=============================\n\n  * High reliability – files are stored in several copies on separate servers.\n    The number of copies is a configurable parameter, even per each file\n  * No Single Point of Failure – all hardware and software components may be\n    redundant\n  * Parallel data operations – many clients can access many files concurrently\n  * Capacity can be dynamically expanded by simply adding new servers/disks\n    on the fly\n  * Retired hardware may be removed on the fly\n  * Deleted files are retained for a configurable period of time (a file system\n    level \"trash bin\")\n  * Coherent, \"atomic\" snapshots of files, even while the files are being\n    written/accessed\n  * Access to the file system can be limited based on IP address and/or password\n    (similarly as in NFS)\n  * Data tiering – supports different storage policies for different\n    files/directories in Storage Classes mechanism\n  * Per-directory, \"project\" quotas – configurable per RAW space, usable space,\n    number of inodes with hard and soft quotas support\n  * Apart from file system storage, MooseFS also provides block storage (mfsbdev)\n  * Efficient, pure C implementation\n  * Ethernet support\n\n\nSupported platforms\n===================\n\nMooseFS can be installed on any POSIX compliant operating system including\nvarious Linux distributions, FreeBSD and macOS:\n\n  * Ubuntu\n  * Debian\n  * RHEL / CentOS\n  * OpenSUSE\n  * FreeBSD\n  * macOS\n\nMooseFS Client uses FUSE library, available for:\nLinux & BSD (https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)\nand macOS (https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse).\n\nThere is a separate MooseFS Client for Microsoft Windows available,\nbuilt on top of Dokany (https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany).\n\n\nGetting started\n===============\n\nYou can install MooseFS using your favorite package manager on one\nof the following platforms using officially supported repositories\n(https://moosefs.com/download):\n\n  * Ubuntu 16 / 18 / 20 / 22 / 24\n  * Debian 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 13\n  * RHEL / CentOS 7 / 8 / 9\n  * FreeBSD 11 / 12 / 13 / 14\n  * macOS 10.12+\n  * Ubuntu 20 / 22 – Raspberry Pi\n  * Debian 11 / 12 – Raspberry Pi\n\nPackages for CentOS 6 are also available, but no longer supported.\n\nDebian packages are compatible with Proxmox.\nCentOS packages are compatible with Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux and openSUSE Leap.\n\nMinimal set of packages, which are needed to run MooseFS:\n  * moosefs-master – MooseFS Master Server for metadata servers,\n  * moosefs-chunkserver – MooseFS Chunkserver for data storage servers,\n  * moosefs-client – MooseFS Client – client side package to mount\n    the filesystem.\n\n\nSource code\n-----------\n\nFeel free to download the source code from our GitHub code repository!\n\nInstall the following dependencies before building MooseFS from sources:\n  * Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev libfuse3-dev pkg-config\n  (if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use: \n  sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev libfuse-dev pkg-config)\n  * CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ make libpcap-devel zlib-devel fuse3-devel pkgconfig\n  (if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use:\n  sudo yum install gcc make libpcap-devel zlib-devel fuse-devel pkgconfig)\n\nRecommended packages:\n  * Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install fuse3\n  (if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use: sudo apt install fuse)\n  * CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install fuse3\n  (if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use: sudo yum install fuse)\n\nBuilding MooseFS on Linux can be easily done by running ./linux_build.sh.\nSimilarly, use ./freebsd_build.sh in order to build MooseFS on FreeBSD\nand respectively ./macosx_build.sh on macOS. Remember that these scripts\ndo not install binaries (i.e. do not run make install) at the end. Run this\ncommand manually.\n\nMinimal setup\n-------------\n\nJust three steps to have MooseFS up and running:\n\n1. Install at least one Master Server\n\n   1. Install moosefs-master package\n   2. Prepare default config (as root):\n        cd /etc/mfs\n        cp mfsmaster.cfg.sample mfsmaster.cfg\n        cp mfsexports.cfg.sample mfsexports.cfg\n   3. Prepare the metadata file (as root):\n        cd /var/lib/mfs\n        cp metadata.mfs.empty metadata.mfs\n        chown mfs:mfs metadata.mfs\n        rm metadata.mfs.empty\n   4. Run Master Server (as root): mfsmaster start\n   5. Make this machine visible under 'mfsmaster' name, e.g. by adding\n      a DNS entry (recommended) or by adding it in /etc/hosts on all servers\n      that run any of MooseFS components\n\n\n2. Install at least two Chunkservers\n\n   1. Install moosefs-chunkserver package\n   2. Prepare default config (as root):\n        cd /etc/mfs\n        cp mfschunkserver.cfg.sample mfschunkserver.cfg\n        cp mfshdd.cfg.sample mfshdd.cfg\n   3. At the end of mfshdd.cfg file make one or more entries containing paths\n      to HDDs / partitions designated for storing chunks, e.g.:\n        /mnt/chunks1\n        /mnt/chunks2\n        /mnt/chunks3\n      It is recommended to use XFS as an underlying filesystem\n      for disks designated to store chunks.\n   4. Change the ownership and permissions to mfs:mfs to above\n      mentioned locations:\n        chown mfs:mfs /mnt/chunks1 /mnt/chunks2 /mnt/chunks3\n        chmod 770 /mnt/chunks1 /mnt/chunks2 /mnt/chunks3\n   5. Start the Chunkserver: mfschunkserver start\n\n   Repeat the steps above for second (third, ...) Chunkserver.\n   More than two Chunkservers are strongly recommended.\n\n\n3. Client side: mount MooseFS filesystem\n\n   1. Install moosefs-client package\n   2. Mount MooseFS (as root):\n        mkdir /mnt/mfs\n        mount -t moosefs mfsmaster: /mnt/mfs\n      or:\n        mfsmount -H mfsmaster /mnt/mfs\n   3. You can also add an /etc/fstab entry to mount MooseFS during\n      the system boot:\n        mfsmaster: /mnt/mfs moosefs defaults,mfsdelayedinit 0 0\n\n   There are more configuration parameters available but most\n   of them may stay with defaults. We do our best to keep MooseFS easy\n   to deploy and maintain.\n\n   MooseFS, for testing purposes, can even be installed on a single machine!\n\n\nAdditional tools\n----------------\n\nSetting up moosefs-cli or moosefs-cgi with moosefs-cgiserv is also\nrecommended – it gives you a possibility to monitor the cluster online:\n  1. Install moosefs-cli moosefs-cgi moosefs-cgiserv packages\n     (they are typically set up on the Master Server)\n  2. Run MooseFS CGI Server (as root): mfscgiserv start\n  3. Open http://mfsmaster:9425 in your web browser\n\nIt is also strongly recommended to set up at least one Metalogger on a different\nmachine than Master Server (e.g. on one of Chunkservers).

It is easy to deploy and maintain, highly reliable, fault tolerant, highly performing, easily scalable and POSIX compliant.\n\nMooseFS spreads data over a number of commodity servers, which are visible to the user as one resource. For standard file operations MooseFS acts like ordinary Unix-like file system:\n\n* A hierarchical structure – **directory tree**\n* Stores **POSIX file attributes** – permissions, last access and modification times, etc.\n* Supports **ACLs**\n* Supports POSIX and BSD **file locks** – including support for **distributed file locking**\n* Supports **special files** – block and character devices, pipes and sockets\n* Supports **symbolic links** – file names pointing to target files, not necessarily on MooseFS\n* Supports **hard links** – different names of files which refer to the same data on MooseFS\n\nDistinctive MooseFS features:\n\n* **High reliability** – files are stored in several copies on separate servers. The number of copies is a configurable parameter, even per each file\n* **No Single Point of Failure** – all hardware and software components may be redundant\n* **Parallel** data operations – many clients can access many files concurrently\n* Capacity can be **dynamically expanded** by simply adding new servers/disks on the fly\n* Retired hardware **may be removed on the fly**\n* Deleted files are retained for a configurable period of time (a **file system level \"trash bin\"**)\n* **Coherent, \"atomic\" snapshots** of files, even while the files are being written/accessed\n* **Access to the file system can be limited** based on IP address and/or password (similarly as in NFS)\n* **Data tiering** – supports different storage policies for different files/directories in Storage Classes mechanism\n* Per-directory, **\"project\" quotas** – configurable per RAW space, usable space, number of inodes with hard and soft quotas support\n* Apart from file system storage, MooseFS also provides **block storage** (`mfsbdev`)\n* Efficient, **pure C** implementation\n* **Ethernet** support\n\n## Supported platforms\nMooseFS can be installed on any POSIX compliant operating system including various Linux distributions, FreeBSD and macOS:\n\n* Ubuntu\n* Debian\n* RHEL / CentOS\n* OpenSUSE\n* FreeBSD\n* macOS\n\nMooseFS Client uses FUSE library, available for: [Linux & BSD](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) and [macOS](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse).\n\nThere is a separate MooseFS Client for Microsoft Windows available, built on top of [Dokany](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany).\n\n## Getting started\nYou can install MooseFS using your favourite package manager on one of the following platforms using [officially supported repositories](https://moosefs.com/download):\n\n* Ubuntu 16 / 18 / 20 / 22 / 24\n* Debian 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 13\n* RHEL / CentOS 7 / 8 / 9\n* FreeBSD 11 / 12 / 13 / 14\n* macOS 10.12+\n* Ubuntu 20 / 22 – Raspberry Pi\n* Debian 11 / 12 – Raspberry Pi\n\nPackages for CentOS 6 are also available, but no longer supported.\n\nDebian packages are compatible with Proxmox.\nCentOS packages are compatible with Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux and openSUSE Leap.\n\nMinimal set of packages, which are needed to run MooseFS:\n\n* `moosefs-master` MooseFS Master Server for metadata servers,\n* `moosefs-chunkserver` MooseFS Chunkserver for data storage servers,\n* `moosefs-client` MooseFS Client – client side package to mount the filesystem.\n\n### Source code\nFeel free to download the source code from our GitHub code repository!\n\nInstall the following dependencies before building MooseFS from sources:\n\n* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev libfuse3-dev pkg-config`\n(if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use `sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev libfuse-dev pkg-config`)\n* CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install gcc make libpcap-devel zlib-devel fuse3-devel pkgconfig`\n(if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use `sudo yum install gcc make libpcap-devel zlib-devel fuse-devel pkgconfig`)\n\nRecommended packages:\n\n* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install fuse3`\n(if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use `sudo apt install fuse`)\n* CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install fuse3`\n(if you don't have FUSE v. 3 in your system, use `sudo yum install fuse`)\n\nBuilding MooseFS on Linux can be easily done by running `./linux_build.sh`. Similarly, use `./freebsd_build.sh` in order to build MooseFS on FreeBSD and respectively `./macosx_build.sh` on macOS. Remember that these scripts do not install binaries (i.e. do not run `make install`) at the end. Run this command manually.\n\n### Minimal setup\nJust three steps to have MooseFS up and running:\n\n#### 1. Install at least one Master Server\n1. Install `moosefs-master` package\n2. Prepare default config (as `root`):\n```\ncd /etc/mfs\ncp mfsmaster.cfg.sample mfsmaster.cfg\ncp mfsexports.cfg.sample mfsexports.cfg\n```\n3. Prepare the metadata file (as `root`):\n```\ncd /var/lib/mfs\ncp metadata.mfs.empty metadata.mfs\nchown mfs:mfs metadata.mfs\nrm metadata.mfs.empty\n```\n4. Run Master Server (as `root`): `mfsmaster start`\n5. Make this machine visible under `mfsmaster` name, e.g. by adding a DNS entry (recommended) or by adding it in `/etc/hosts` on **all** servers that run any of MooseFS components.\n\n#### 2. Install at least two Chunkservers\n1. Install `moosefs-chunkserver` package\n2. Prepare default config (as `root`):\n```\ncd /etc/mfs\ncp mfschunkserver.cfg.sample mfschunkserver.cfg\ncp mfshdd.cfg.sample mfshdd.cfg\n```\n3. At the end of `mfshdd.cfg` file make one or more entries containing paths to HDDs / partitions designated for storing chunks, e.g.:\n```\n/mnt/chunks1\n/mnt/chunks2\n/mnt/chunks3\n```\nIt is recommended to use XFS as an underlying filesystem for disks designated to store chunks. More than two Chunkservers are **strongly** recommended. \n\n4. Change the ownership and permissions to `mfs:mfs` to above mentioned locations:\n```\nchown mfs:mfs /mnt/chunks1 /mnt/chunks2 /mnt/chunks3\nchmod 770 /mnt/chunks1 /mnt/chunks2 /mnt/chunks3\n```\n5. Start the Chunkserver: `mfschunkserver start`\n\nRepeat steps above for second (third, ...) Chunkserver.\n\n#### 3. Client side: mount MooseFS filesystem\n1. Install `moosefs-client` package\n2. Mount MooseFS (as `root`):\n```\nmkdir /mnt/mfs\nmount -t moosefs mfsmaster: /mnt/mfs\n```\nor: `mfsmount -H mfsmaster /mnt/mfs` if the above method is not supported by your system\n\n3. You can also add an `/etc/fstab` entry to mount MooseFS during the system boot:\n```\nmfsmaster:    /mnt/mfs    moosefs    defaults,mfsdelayedinit    0 0\n```\n\nThere are more configuration parameters available but most of them may stay with defaults. We do our best to keep MooseFS easy to deploy and maintain.\n\nMooseFS, for testing purposes, can even be installed on a single machine!\n\n#### Additional tools\nSetting up `moosefs-cli` or `moosefs-cgi` with `moosefs-cgiserv` is also recommended – it gives you a possibility to monitor the cluster online:\n\n1. Install `moosefs-cli moosefs-cgi moosefs-cgiserv` packages (they are typically set up on the Master Server)\n2. Run MooseFS CGI Server (as `root`): `mfscgiserv start`\n3. Open http://mfsmaster:9425 in your web browser\n\nIt is also **strongly** recommended to set up at least one Metalogger on a different machine than Master Server (e.g. on one of Chunkservers). Metalogger constantly synchronizes and backups the metadata:\n\n1. Install `moosefs-metalogger` package\n2. Prepare default config (as `root`):\n```\ncd /etc/mfs\ncp mfsmetalogger.cfg.sample mfsmetalogger.cfg\n```\n3. Run Metalogger (as `root`): `mfsmetalogger start`\n\n\n\nRefer to [installation guides](https://moosefs.com/support/#documentation) for more details.\n\n## Some facts\n* Date of the first public release: 2008-05-30\n* The project web site: https://moosefs.com\n* Installation and using MooseFS: https://moosefs.com/support\n* (Old) Sourceforge project site: https://sourceforge.net/projects/moosefs\n\n## Contact us\n* Reporting bugs: [GitHub issue](https://github.com/moosefs/moosefs/issues) or [support@moosefs.com](mailto:support@moosefs.com)\n* General: [contact@moosefs.com](mailto:contact@moosefs.com)\n\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright (c) 2008-2024 Jakub Kruszona-Zawadzki, Saglabs SA\n\nThis file is part of MooseFS.\n\nMooseFS is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 2 (only).\n\nMooseFS is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
