Among the multiple benefits it provides are advanced scheduling facilities, message passing, interrupt management, and messaging services. Eclipse ThreadX RTOS has many advanced features, including picokernel architecture, preemption threshold, event chaining, and a rich set of system services.\n\nHere are the key features and modules of ThreadX:\n\n![ThreadX Key Features](./docs/threadx-features.png)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nEclipse ThreadX has been integrated to the semiconductor's SDKs and development environment. You can develop using the tools of choice from [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/campaigns/x-cube-azrtos-azure-rtos-stm32.html), [NXP](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/embedded-software/azure-rtos-for-nxp-microcontrollers:AZURE-RTOS), [Renesas](https://github.com/renesas/azure-rtos) and [Microchip](https://mu.microchip.com/get-started-simplifying-your-iot-design-with-azure-rtos).\n\nWe also provide [getting started guide](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/getting-started) and [samples](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/samples) using development boards from semiconductors you can build and test with.\n\nSee [Overview of Eclipse ThreadX RTOS](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/rtos-docs/blob/main/rtos-docs/threadx/overview-threadx.md) for the high-level overview. \n\n## Repository Structure and Usage\n### Directory layout\n\n    .\n    ├── cmake                        # CMakelist files for building the project\n    ├── common                       # Core ThreadX files\n    ├── common_modules               # Core ThreadX module files\n    ├── common_smp                   # Core ThreadX SMP files\n    ├── docs                         # Documentation supplements\n    ├── ports                        # Architecture and compiler specific files.

It does not represent the latest General Availability (GA) release of the library. Each official release (preview or GA) will be tagged to mark the commit and push it into the Github releases tab, e.g. `v6.2-rel`.\n\n> When you see xx-xx-xxxx, 6.x or x.x in function header, this means the file is not officially released yet. They will be updated in the next release.

applications.\n```\narc_hs_smp\ncortex_a34_smp\ncortex_a35_smp\ncortex_a53_smp\ncortex_a55_smp\ncortex_a57_smp\ncortex_a5x_smp\ncortex_a5_smp\ncortex_a65ae_smp\ncortex_a65_smp\ncortex_a72_smp\ncortex_a73_smp\ncortex_a75_smp\ncortex_a76ae_smp\ncortex_a76_smp\ncortex_a77_smp\ncortex_a78_smp\ncortex_a7_smp\ncortex_a9_smp\nlinux\n```\n\n## Adaptation layer for ThreadX\n\nThreadX is an advanced real-time operating system (RTOS) designed specifically for deeply embedded applications. To help ease application migration to ThreadX RTOS, Eclipse ThreadX provides [adaption layers](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/threadx/tree/master/utility/rtos_compatibility_layers) for various legacy RTOS APIs (FreeRTOS, POSIX, OSEK, etc.).\n\n## Component dependencies\n\nThe main components of ThreadX RTOS are each provided in their own repository, but there are dependencies between them, as shown in the following graph. This is important to understand when setting up your builds.\n\n![dependency graph](docs/deps.png)\n\n> You will have to take the dependency graph above into account when building anything other than ThreadX itself.\n\n### Building and using the library\n\nInstruction for building the ThreadX as static library using Arm GNU Toolchain and CMake. If you are using toolchain and IDE from semiconductor, you might follow its own instructions to use ThreadX RTOS components as explained in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.\n\n1. Install the following tools:\n\n    * [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.0 or later\n    * [Arm GNU Toolchain for arm-none-eabi](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)\n    * [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)\n\n1. Cloning the repo\n\n    ```bash\n    $ git clone https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/threadx.git\n    ```\n\n1. Define the features and addons you need in `tx_user.h` and build together with the component source code. You can refer to [`tx_user_sample.h`](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/threadx/blob/master/common/inc/tx_user_sample.h) as an example.\n\n1. Building as a static library\n\n    Each component of ThreadX RTOS comes with a composable CMake-based build system that supports many different MCUs and host systems. Integrating any of these components into your device app code is as simple as adding a git submodule and then including it in your build using the CMake `add_subdirectory()`.\n\n    While the typical usage pattern is to include ThreadX into your device code source tree to be built & linked with your code, you can compile this project as a standalone static library to confirm your build is set up correctly.\n\n    An example of building the library for Cortex-M4:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ cmake -Bbuild -GNinja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/cortex_m4.cmake .\n\n    $ cmake --build ./build\n    ```\n\n## Licensing\n\nLicense terms for using Eclipse ThreadX are defined in the LICENSE.txt file of this repo. Please refer to this file for all definitive licensing information for all content, incl. the history of this repo.\n\n## Resources\n\nThe following are references to additional ThreadX RTOS resources:\n\n- **Product introduction**: https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/rtos-docs\n- **Product issues and bugs, or feature requests**: https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/threadx/issues\n- **TraceX Installer**: https://aka.ms/azrtos-tracex-installer\n\nYou can also check [previous questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/threadx-rtos+threadx) or ask new ones on StackOverflow using the `threadx-rtos` and `threadx` tags.\n\n## Security\n\nEclipse ThreadX provides OEMs with components to secure communication and to create code and data isolation using underlying MCU/MPU hardware protection mechanisms. It is ultimately the responsibility of the device builder to ensure the device fully meets the evolving security requirements associated with its specific use case.\n\n## Contribution\n\nPlease follow the instructions provided in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the corresponding repository.\n"
