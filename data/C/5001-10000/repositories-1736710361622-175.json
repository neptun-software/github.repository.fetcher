This will allow IPv6 pinhole\r\n         support for clients.  It must be enabled on the WAN\r\n         page.  Existing pinholes will be listed on the\r\n         System Log -> IPV6 page.\r\n\r\n         Note that IGDv2 has compatibility issues with various\r\n         clients that do not properly follow the standard.\r\n  - UPDATED: Openvpn to 2.6.10.\r\n  - UPDATED: TOR to 0.4.8.10.\r\n  - UPDATED: wsdd2 to 2023-12-21 snapshot.\r\n  - UPDATED: miniupnpd to 2.3.6.\r\n  - UPDATED: wireguard kernel to v1.0.20220627.\r\n  - UPDATED: wireguard tools to 2023-08-04 snapshot.\r\n  - UPDATED: dropbear to 2024.84.\r\n  - UPDATED: strongswan to 5.9.13 (fixes CVE-2023-41913)\r\n  - CHANGED: Hardcoded location of the CA bundle in inadyn, so it\r\n             no longer needs to be manually defined in custom\r\n             configurations.\r\n  - CHANGED: Re-designed Tools->Sysinfo page, adding graphs\r\n             and removing useless content.\r\n  - CHANGED: Updated free memory report on networkmap to also\r\n             consider reclaimable memory as being free (kjbracey)\r\n  - CHANGED: \"Prevent client auto DoH\" will also prevent the use of\r\n             Apple's iCloud Private Relay.\r\n  - CHANGED: NAT Passthrough page - removed the \"Enabled + NAT\r\n             Helper\" option as the firewall no longer blocks\r\n             traffic when set to disabled.  This is back to the\r\n             former behaviour, where this setting only controls\r\n             whether or not to load the NAT helper.  You might\r\n             need to readjust that setting if you had previously\r\n             changed it.\r\n  - CHANGED: SIP, RTSP and H323 ALG (NAT helpers) are now\r\n             disabled by default, as these legacy features tend\r\n             to create issues with modern VoIP setups.\r\n             This change will only apply to people doing a\r\n             factory default reset of their router.\r\n  - FIXED: Concurrent cronjob changes through cru could cause\r\n           collisions, leading to missing jobs (dave14305)\r\n  - FIXED: crond would not use the new timezone if it got changed.\r\n  - FIXED: MiniDLNA web interface could only be accessed through an\r\n           IP address (regression in 3004.388.6).\r\n  - FIXED: CVE-2023-5678 & CVE-2024-0727 in openssl (backport from\r\n           Ubuntu by RSDNTWK)\r\n  - FIXED: Long lists on System Log -> Connections tab could result\r\n           in a timeout (Sani Huttunen)\r\n  - REMOVED: Temperature page (charts are now part of the redesigned\r\n             Tools->Sysinfo page).\r\n\r\n\r\n3004.388.6_2 (26-Feb-2024)\r\n  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.90 (resolves CVE 2023-50868 and CVE 2023-50387).\r\n  - FIXED: LACP support was missing on the XT12.\r\n\r\n\r\n3004.388.6 (20-Jan-2024)\r\n  - NOTE: Since Asus provided GPL code for the RT-AX56U, this model\r\n          will exceptionally be included with this release, despite\r\n          still being considered being end-of-life.\r\n\r\n  - NOTE: Asus reworked the way SSL certificates are handled in\r\n          24353.  The automatic conversion code does not always\r\n          work properly, you might need to force your router\r\n          to re-generate its SSL certificates by toggling the\r\n          SSL mode on the DDNS page.\r\n\r\n  - NEW: Added ethtool to the firmware.\r\n  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 388_24353.\r\n  - UPDATED: nano to 7.2.\r\n  - UPDATED: ncurses to 6.3.\r\n  - UPDATED: OUI database used by networkmap and the webui.\r\n  - FIXED: CVE-2023-48795 in dropbear.\r\n  - FIXED: e-Learning category not always properly identified\r\n           on the Classification/Stats page.\r\n  - FIXED: Incorrectly report 2.4 GHz as being disabled when\r\n           disabling 6 GHz on the GT-AXE16000.\r\n  - FIXED: UPNP leases without a description would not appear\r\n           on the Forwarded Ports page.\r\n\r\n\r\n3004.388.5 (2-Dec-2023)\r\n  - UPDATED: OpenSSL to 1.1.1w.\r\n  - UPDATED: Curl to 8.4.0.\r\n  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.6.8.\r\n  - CHANGED: Enable fast-io for OpenVPN clients and servers that\r\n             use UDP, which will speed up performance on some models.\r\n  - CHANGED: You can now directly enter an IPv6 address on the\r\n             Network Tools page as a target.\r\n  - CHANGED: Display tracked connections on the QoS/Classification\r\n             page even if QoS isn't set to Adaptive QoS.\r\n  - CHANGED: QOS/Classification page can now resolve local IPv6\r\n             addresses.\r\n  - CHANGED: Allow custom MTU for Wireguard clients (patch from\r\n             Asus).\r\n  - FIXED: CIDR-formatted addresses were rejected on the Network\r\n           Filter page.  Implemented temporary workaround.\r\n  - FIXED: Various issues with the QOS Classification page.\r\n  - FIXED: Netfilter TEE kernel module is missing.\r\n  - FIXED: OpenVPN client state getting cleared when Wireless\r\n           was being restarted.\r\n  - FIXED: Networkmap wasn't recognizing the GT-AX11000_PRO as\r\n           having USB 3.0 ports\r\n\r\n\r\n3004.388.4 (21-Aug-2023)\r\n  - NOTE: In preparation for the new 3.0.0.6 codebase, the version\r\n          string will now start with 3004 or 3006 to match with\r\n          upstream.\r\n\r\n  - NOTE: The RT-AX56U is no longer supported, as Asus has put it\r\n          on End-of-Life status, and the previous Asuswrt-Merlin\r\n          388 releases for that model were all based on untested\r\n          code.\r\n\r\n  - NEW: Display channel utilisation for supported platforms on the\r\n         Wireless Log page.\r\n  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 388_23588.\r\n  - UPDATED: curl to 8.1.2.\r\n  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.6.5.\r\n  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1u.\r\n  - UPDATED: tor to 0.4.7.13.\r\n  - CHANGED: FTP server will now only support strong ciphers\r\n             in TLS mode.\r\n  - FIXED: QOS Classification showing no Upload data on some\r\n           WAN configurations.\r\n  - FIXED: Radio temperature graphs weren't updating\r\n  - FIXED: XT12 proximity pairing wasn't working (missing\r\n           bluetooth firmware)\r\n  - REMOVED: Ethernet port status from the Tools Sysinfo page\r\n             (as this is redundant with Asus' own display\r\n             now available on the networkmap page).\r\n\r\n\r\n388.2_4 (17-Aug-2023)\r\n  - NOTE: This release is only for the GT-AXE11000.\r\n\r\n  - UPDATED: Critical Wireless driver update, Asus strongly\r\n             recommends updating.\r\n\r\n\r\n388.3 (9-June-2023)\r\n  - NOTE: This release is only available for the RT-AX88U_Pro.\r\n\r\n  - NEW: Merged with GPL 388_23110, adding support for a new\r\n         RT-AX88U PRO hardware revision.\r\n\r\n\r\n388.2_2 (7-May-2023)\r\n  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 388_22668 for the XT12 (only)\r\n  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.6.3.\r\n  - FIXED: QoS Status page wouldn't display Upload stats\r\n           if the WAN interface was set to a secondary\r\n           2.5G/10G port instead of the default WAN port.\r\n  - FIXED: dnsmasq may crash if no DNS server is configured\r\n           (fix backported from dnsmasq upstream)\r\n  - FIXED: Missing GPY211 driver for the XT12 and for certain\r\n           hardware revisions of other HND 5.04 models.\r\n\r\n\r\n388.2 (12-Apr-2023)\r\n  - NOTE: This release is currently not available\r\n          for the XT12 due to issues with that model's GPL.\r\n\r\n  - NEW: Added support for the RT-AX88U Pro.\r\n  - NEW: Merged with GPL 388_22525.\r\n  - NEW: Added Site Survey page under Network Tools tab.  This is\r\n         the same network scan that is available for pre-HND\r\n         models, with Wifi 6E support added.\r\n  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.89.\r\n  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.6.2.  If your client fails to connect\r\n             then your custom settings must contain settings no\r\n             longer supported by OpenVPN 2.6.  Review the System\r\n             Log, then remove unsupported settings that are\r\n             reported in your log.\r\n  - UPDATED: nettle to 3.8.1.\r\n  - UPDATED: inadyn to 2.10.0.\r\n  - UPDATED: dropbear to 2022.83.\r\n  - UPDATED: miniupnpd to 2.3.3.\r\n  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1t.\r\n  - UPDATED: curl to 8.0.1.\r\n  - CHANGED: moved WiFi Radar to the Network Tools tab.\r\n  - CHANGED: Disabled auto logout on System Log and Wireless Log\r\n             pages.\r\n  - CHANGED: Reduced EDNS packet size from 1280 to 1232 bytes in\r\n             dnsmasq, to better work with some upstream servers\r\n             not fully supporting EDNS0.\r\n  - CHANGED: Allow empty fields on WireGuard Client page if the\r\n             client is disabled.  This allow users to manually\r\n             clear settings when they are no longer using a client.\r\n  - FIXED: NTP redirection wouldn't work properly with Guest\r\n           Network, removed redirection for these.\r\n  - FIXED: Added missing Tools icon on ROG UI (icon contributed\r\n           by Cody).\r\n  - FIXED: DDNS was being refreshed every time IPv6 bound6() event\r\n           occured even if IPv6 DDNS update was disabled.\r\n  - FIXED: Wireless Log wouldn't properly show IPv6 address\r\n           for clients with multiple addresses.\r\n  - FIXED: ICMPv6 pings would be dropped when DoS protection\r\n           was enabled (regression in 388.1).\r\n\r\n\r\n388.1 (3-Dec-2022)\r\n  - NOTE: This release is only available for AX models.\r\n          AC models will remain on the 386_xx release branch.\r\n\r\n  - NEW: Add RT-AX86U_PRO support.\r\n  - NEW: Merged with GPL 388_20566 (RT-AX88U and GT-AX11000)\r\n  - NEW: Merged with GPL 388_21224 (all other AX models)\r\n  - NEW: Experimental ROG UI version for GT models, as a separate\r\n         firmware image within the distribution archive, with\r\n         \"_rog\" in the filename.\r\n  - NEW: (Asus 388) WireGuard client and server.  The server uses\r\n         the new 388 VPN server webui.  Implemented a webui for\r\n         clients, based on the early development UI from Asus.\r\n\r\n         WG client routing is handled by VPN Director - you must\r\n         configure redirection rules through it, same as on stock\r\n         firmware which requires configuring rules through\r\n         VPN Fusion.\r\n\r\n         DNS handling will be identical to OpenVPN's Exclusive DNS\r\n         mode, forcing clients to use the DNS provided by it\r\n         (if any is provided).\r\n\r\n         Note that enabling WireGuard will disable hardware\r\n         NAT acceleration due to compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\n  - NEW: httpd support for EC certificates (Ivan Kruglov)\r\n  - UPDATED: getdns/stubby to 1.7.2/0.4.2.\r\n  - UPDATED: zlib to 1.2.12 + backports.\r\n  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1s.\r\n  - CHANGED: Rebranded DNSFilter as DNS Director.  This will prevent\r\n             confusion with the company sharing the same name, and\r\n             also better describes what the feature does.\r\n  - CHANGED: Setting an OpenVPN client to redirect all traffic while\r\n             in \"Exclusive\" DNS mode will now force redirect ALL\r\n             DNS traffic just like in VPN Director mode.\r\n             While this will allow redirecting clients with\r\n             hardcoded DNS servers, it also means that your whole\r\n             LAN will lose the ability of doing local name\r\n             resolution.  It might be best to use VPN Director\r\n             in that case to control which client should\r\n             be involved in the DNS redirection, or use\r\n             DNS Director instead of Exclusive DNS mode.\r\n  - CHANGED: (Asus 388) nvram storage increased to 192 KB on newer\r\n             HND 5.04 devices like the GT-AXE16000.\r\n  - CHANGED: Reworked VPN Status page to only show currently\r\n             active services.\r\n  - CHANGED: Reworked VPN Director page design, added buttons to\r\n             access a client's settings page, and allow leaving\r\n             both source and destination IPs empty (for \"all\").\r\n  - CHANGED: Optimized VPN Director WAN and DNS rule creation, so\r\n             they no longer get re-created multiple times when\r\n             editing VPNDirector rules.\r\n  - CHANGED: Switched generated self-signed certificate to an\r\n             EC certificate.\r\n  - CHANGED: Disabled DSS key support in Dropbear SSH.\r\n  - FIXED: Wrong temperatures used by the temperature graphs\r\n           (386.8 regression)\r\n  - FIXED: CVE-2022-37434 in zlib.\r\n  - FIXED: GT-AXE16000 random reboots when using an OpenVPN\r\n           client with VPN Director and Adaptive QoS.\r\n  - FIXED: Clients connected to Guest Network 1 aren't\r\n           redirected if NTP interception is enabled.\r\n  - FIXED: Name was truncated to 31 chars when enabling OpenVPN client's\r\n           Server Certificate Name Validation.\r\n  - REMOVED: Interface selector on Speedtest page (no longer\r\n             working, possibly due to an ookla client update)\r\n  - REMOVED: NAT Type setting on HND 5.04 devices (fullcone is\r\n             not supported by kernel 4.19, so it wasn't working)\r\n\r\n\r\n386.8 (13-Aug-2022)\r\n  - NOTE: This release is only available for the RT-AX88U as\r\n          well as the two new models listed below.\r\n  - NEW: Added support for the GT-AXE16000.\r\n  - NEW: Added support for the GT-AX11000_Pro.\r\n  - NEW: Added support for new RT-AX88U hardware revision.\r\n  - UPDATED: Merged with GPL 386_49634.\r\n  - CHANGED: Re-enabled IPv6 DDNS support.\r\n  - CHANGED: Once again block router DNS access over IPv6 when\r\n             using DNSFilter on a pre-HND model (reverted back\r\n             to 386.7 behaviour for that scenario)\r\n  - FIXED: inaccurate nvram usage on Sysinfo page for some HND\r\n           models.  Now accurately report kernel nvram usage.\r\n  - FIXED: WiFi Radar page alignment.\r\n  - FIXED: AiMesh node new firmware popup would use the device model\r\n           (like RT-AC66U_B1) rather than the product id (like\r\n           RT-AC68U) for the generated download URL.\r\n  - FIXED: OVPN client with DNS set to strict had lower priority\r\n           than DNSPrivacy servers.\r\n  - FIXED: IPv6 DNS may be missing if DNSPrivacy is enabled.\r\n  - FIXED: Wifi Radar pages missing on XT12.\r\n  - FIXED: QRcode failing to generate if the SSID contained unicode\r\n           characters (like emojis or other UTF8 entities)\r\n\r\n\r\n386.7_2 (24-July-2022)\r\n  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1q.\r\n  - UPDATED: RT-AX86U driver + SDK updated to latest upstream version\r\n  - UPDATED: RT-AX88U and GT-AX11000 radio firmware downgraded to the\r\n             previous version.\r\n  - FIXED: Some ISPs would fail to allocate a proper IPv6 prefix (tvlz)\r\n  - FIXED: Packet checksum errors logged when using DNSFilter in Router\r\n           mode.  Router mode will no longer use DNAT, except for newer\r\n           HND 5.04 models like the GT-AX6000 or XT12, which work\r\n           properly.  Non-Router mode on HND will still use\r\n           the new DNAT support added in 386.7.\r\n  - FIXED: Some SSH clients would end up with an incorrect PATH\r\n           value for the default search path.\r\n  - FIXED: OpenVPN clients wouldn't get updated routing tables\r\n           if an OpenVPN server was stopped/started while an\r\n           OpenVPN client was connected\r\n\r\n\r\n386.7 (22-June-2022)\r\n  - NEW: IPV6 support for DNSFilter for HND router models.\r\n         Custom settings can also let you specify IPv6 servers.\r\n         These (as well as providers that support IPv6) will\r\n         now also get intercepted and redirected like the IPv4\r\n         DNS servers are.\r\n  - UPDATED: Merged with 386_49335 GPL for the RT-AC5300.\r\n  - UPDATED: Merged with 386_48966 GPL for all other models.\r\n  - UPDATED: openssl to 1.1.1o.\r\n  - UPDATED: haveged to 1.9.18.\r\n  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.5.7.\r\n  - UPDATED: tor to 0.4.7.8.\r\n  - CHANGED: dhcpc-event now has a second parameter that will\r\n             contain \"4\" or \"6\" depending on the IP protocol of\r\n             the event (dave14305)\r\n  - FIXED: JFFS backup/restore functions not working on XT12\r\n           and GT-AX6000.\r\n  - FIXED: CVE-2022-0934 in dnsmasq (backport)\r\n  - FIXED: CVE-2022-26376 (reported by Cisco Talos, fixed by Asus)\r\n  - FIXED: DNSFilter client list was limited to around 10 clients\r\n           on some models.\r\n  - FIXED: AuraRGB could be re-enabled on reboot if it was\r\n           previously disabled.\r\n  - FIXED: Wifi LEDs wouldn't turn back on when re-enabling\r\n           LEDs on the RT-AX86S.\r\n\r\n\r\n386.6 (20-Apr-2022)\r\n  - NOTE: This release is only available on the GT-AX6000\r\n          and XT12.\r\n  - NEW: Added support for the GT-AX6000.\r\n  - NEW: Added support for the ZenWifi Pro XT12.\r\n  - NEW: Added Cloudflare and AdGuard to DNSFilter services.\r\n  - NEW: Added option to enable/disable IPv6 support to OpenVPN\r\n         server.

This is implemented for all router\r\n             models.\r\n  - CHANGED: Switched dnsmasq crypto backend to nettle.\r\n  - CHANGED: Switched to Asus's own dhcp hostname support.\r\n             Existing dhcp_hostnames entries will be\r\n             converted on first boot.\r\n  - CHANGED: miniupnpd will now be supplied the public WAN\r\n             IP to improve compatibility with dual NAT\r\n             setups.\r\n  - CHANGED: Disabling Auto DoH will now also disable\r\n             Windows' new Discovery of Designated\r\n             Resolvers (DDR) feature.\r\n  - FIXED: Wrong interface might be used for the default\r\n           gateway in an openvpn client routing table.\r\n  - FIXED: Generated OpenVPN certs used SHA1 signatures\r\n           instead of SHA256 (regression from 386.1)\r\n  - FIXED: Various issues with protocol handling when\r\n           importing an ovpn client file.\r\n  - FIXED: IPv6 not working while in Dual WAN mode.\r\n  - FIXED: Failed OpenVPN client connections might sometime\r\n           be stuck with a \"Connecting\" state.\r\n  - FIXED: NTP sometimes failing to update at boot time\r\n           when using IPv6.\r\n  - FIXED: Changes done by firewall-start may be lost after\r\n           ddns service gets stopped when using tunnelbroker\r\n\r\n\r\n386.3_2 (6-Aug-2021)\r\n  - NOTE: closed down the Issue tracker on Github, as 90%\r\n          of it was people asking for technical support,\r\n          or failing to use the supplied submission form.\r\n  - CHANGED: Re-disabled jitterentropy-rngd on non-HND\r\n             models.  It kept using CPU time every two\r\n             seconds and had a very marginal impact on\r\n             the entropy pool (which it never could push\r\n             above the target threshold of 1024).\r\n  - CHANGED: Moved the \"Redirect Internet traffic\" setting on\r\n             the OpenVPN Client page to the Network Settings\r\n             section to increase its visibility, as too many\r\n             users are forgetting to configure it.\r\n  - CHANGED: Display \"Internet traffic not redirected\" instead\r\n             of \"Public IP Unknown\" on the OpenVPN Client\r\n             status display when Redirect Internet traffic\r\n             is set to \"No\".\r\n  - FIXED: Only the first OpenVPN client would be used if\r\n           you had multiple clients connected and the first\r\n           one had a Redirect Internet set to \"No\".  Now,\r\n           setting this to \"No\" means that client's routing\r\n           table will no longer get a default gateway\r\n           configured, allowing traffic to be processed\r\n           by other RPDB tables if there wasn't a matching\r\n           route within that client's table.\r\n  - FIXED: IPV6-compatible DNSFilter servers weren't\r\n           properly configured in dnsmasq.\r\n  - FIXED: DNSFilter client rules may get corrupted after a\r\n           reboot.\r\n\r\n\r\n386.3 (23-July-2021)\r\n  - NOTE: First time you boot into this version, you need to\r\n          either shift-reload the main index page, or clear\r\n          your browser cache.\r\n\r\n  - NEW: Introducing VPN Director, which replaces the original\r\n         policy routing management interface for OpenVPN clients.\r\n         A bit similar to Asus's own VPN Fusion, OpenVPN routing\r\n         rules are now managed through a central web interface,\r\n         and they are stored in JFFS instead of nvram, to allow\r\n         creating more rules, and free up some nvram for\r\n         nvram-limited devices such as the RT-AC68U.\r\n         See the Wiki for more information.\r\n\r\n  - NEW: Added QR codes to the networkmap as well as the Guest\r\n         Network page, to allow easily connecting a mobile\r\n         device just by scanning the QR code.\r\n         The generated QR code can also be saved as a file\r\n         if you'd like to print it.\r\n\r\n  - CHANGED: Rewrote OpenVPN routing handling.  The firmware will\r\n             now handle route creation itself rather than letting\r\n             the openvpn client create/remove routes.\r\n             The new implementation brings a few changes:\r\n\r\n             - \"Force Internet traffic through tunnel\" can now\r\n               be set to \"No\", \"Yes (All)\" or \"VPN Director\".\r\n             - This setting will now override whatever setting\r\n               pushed by the server regarding gateway redirection.\r\n             - The kill switch can now be used in both \"Yes\" and\r\n               \"VPN Director\" routing modes\r\n             - Manually stopping a client will remove the kill\r\n               switch.  It will now only be applied at boot time\r\n               (if client was set to start at boot), or if the\r\n               tunnel is disconnected through a non-user event\r\n\r\n  - CHANGED: Reworked OpenVPN's DNS Exclusive mode implementation\r\n             and interaction with dnsmasq.\r\n  - CHANGED: Moved OpenVPN Custom settings content to JFFS, and\r\n             increased max storage length from around 350 chars\r\n             to 4095 chars.\r\n  - CHANGED: Added support for BCM50991 used for the 2.5G\r\n             interface in newer RT-AX86U revisions.\r\n  - UPDATED: nano to 5.7.\r\n  - UPDATED: curl to 7.76.1.\r\n  - UPDATED: dnsmasq to 2.85-openssl.\r\n  - UPDATED: openvpn to 2.5.3.\r\n  - UPDATED: getdns to 1.7.0.\r\n  - UPDATED: stubby to 0.4.0.\r\n  - FIXED: Setting an OpenVPN client's DNS mode to Exclusive\r\n           could fail to work for certain configurations\r\n  - FIXED: DNS Exclusive redirections applied in Policy mode\r\n           could be executed in the wrong order if you had\r\n           overlapping policy rules in two separate clients.\r\n  - FIXED: Clients connected to Guest Network 1 couldn't be\r\n           routed through an OpenVPN tunnel.\r\n  - FIXED: Clients connected to Guest Network 1 would bypass\r\n           DNSFilter rules.\r\n  - FIXED: USB disks not properly unmounted on reboot\r\n           on some router models.\r\n  - FIXED: Missing error report on OpenVPN client connection\r\n           failure\r\n  - FIXED: profile.add getting used even if JFFS scripting\r\n           was disabled (dave14305)\r\n  - FIXED: Freedns authentication errors would not\r\n           properly be reported as errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n386.2_6 (6-June-2021)\r\n  - NOTE: The IRC channel, #asuswrt, has moved to the\r\n          Libera IRC network (https://libera.chat/).\r\n\r\n  - UPDATED: chart.js to 2.9.4.\r\n  - UPDATED: tor to 0.4.5.8.\r\n  - UPDATED: root certificate bundle to June 5th 2021.\r\n  - FIXED: Fragattack security issues\r\n\r\n\r\n386.2_4 (30-Apr-2021)\r\n  - NEW: Added jitterentropy-rngd to non-HND models, in addition\r\n         to HND models.\r\n  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.5.2.\r\n  - UPDATED: jitterentropy-rngd to 1.2.2 (library 3.0.3)\r\n  - FIXED: Scheduled new FW checks wouldn't display the webui\r\n           notification icon when the local router had a\r\n           new release available.\r\n  - FIXED: OpenVPN server would flip into an error state (being\r\n           shown as \"initializing\" on the webui) whenever an\r\n           inbound client failed to connect to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n386.2_2 (13-Apr-2021)\r\n  - FIXED: IPv6 pings were blocked if sent below the rate limit\r\n           instead of above (issue introduced in 42095)\r\n  - FIXED: kernel debuging log entry (was removed) (RT-AC86U)\r\n  - FIXED: Field that accepted a float value would reject\r\n           values equal to the allowed minimum (for example\r\n           the QoS bandwidth limits)\r\n  - FIXED: QoS Bandwidth settings were hidden on\r\n           non-HND models when accessing the QoS page.\r\n  - CHANGED: Tweaks to the Firmware Upgrade page display.\r\n  - CHANGED: Enabling DOS protection will now also rate limit\r\n             ICMPV6 echo (type 128) packets, like with IPv4.\r\n\r\n\r\n386.2 (2-Apr-2021)\r\n  - NOTE: due to changes in how custom device icons are handled,\r\n          first time you boot with 386.2 you need to either\r\n          shift-reload the main index page, or clear your\r\n          browser cache.\r\n\r\n  - NEW: Added support for the GT-AX11000.  Note that VPN Fusion,\r\n         as well as the ROG-specific features such as the custom\r\n         UI are not supported.\r\n  - NEW: Added support for the RT-AX68U.\r\n  - NEW: Added jitterentropy-rngd daemon to HND routers.  This will\r\n         ensure sufficient entropy is generated early on at\r\n         boot time, reducing boot stalls caused by insufficient\r\n         entropy for the kernel's random number generator,\r\n         and also generally improves security related to\r\n         crypto operations by the router.\r\n  - NEW: Added Cake QoS for HND routers.  Note that just like\r\n         Traditional QoS, this is not compatible with hardware\r\n         acceleration, and therefore might not be usable on\r\n         connections faster than around 350 Mbps (may vary based\r\n         on router models).\r\n  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 386_42095.\r\n  - UPDATED: Openssl to 1.1.1k.\r\n  - UPDATED: OpenVPN to 2.5.1.\r\n  - UPDATED: iproute2 to 5.11.0 (HND models).\r\n  - UPDATED: root certificate bundle to March 9th 2021.\r\n  - CHANGED: qos-start \"init\" user script now runs in blocking\r\n             mode to ensure it's able to complete any changes\r\n             it may apply to qos configs before these\r\n             configs get applied.\r\n  - FIXED: Router could get stuck at boot time after the user\r\n           migrated from stock firmware, or just erased his\r\n           JFFS partition, requiring a factory default reset.\r\n  - FIXED: ATM checkbox could not be enabled on QOS page.\r\n  - FIXED: DST not getting applied to some timezones (snauton)\r\n  - FIXED: Traditional QoS was broken in 386.1 (dave14305)\r\n  - FIXED: Connected IPSEC clients weren't shown on the VPN Status\r\n           page.\r\n  - FIXED: Userspace conntrack tool was no longer working\r\n  - FIXED: Traffic Monitor spikes for HND models.

This allows Windows clients\r\n         to detect the router's shared USB drives even if SMBv1\r\n         support is disabled.\r\n  - NEW: Re-added option to extend the WAN's TTL (from stock\r\n         firmware, was previously disabled as it used to\r\n         be broken)\r\n  - UPDATED: RT-AC3200 and RT-AC87U to 382_51640/51634 binary blobs\r\n             (with a few exceptions for 384_xxxx compatibility)\r\n  - UPDATED: Merged GPL 384_45717 (except for RT-AX88U)\r\n  - UPDATED: Nano 4.2.\r\n  - UPDATED: OpenSSL-11 to 1.1.1c.\r\n  - UPDATED: OpenSSL-10 to 1.0.2s.\r\n  - UPDATED: curl 7.65.1.\r\n  - UPDATED: miniupnpd 20190604.\r\n  - CHANGED: Local clients will be shown by their hostname\r\n             on the Classification page.\r\n  - CHANGED: Reworked handling of up/down events in OpenVPN.\r\n             Server instance will now also use its own\r\n             updown script, which will handle firing up\r\n             openvpn-event (if present).\r\n  - CHANGED: Inbound traffic sent to you through an OpenVPN client\r\n             will now be dropped by default.  This can be changed\r\n             through the new \"Inbound Firewall\" parameter found\r\n             on the OpenVPN client page.  You should only change\r\n             this to \"Allow\" if running a site2site tunnel with\r\n             a trusted remote server, or if you do expect\r\n             traffic to be forwarded to you through the tunnel.\r\n  - CHANGED: The router will now use ISP-provided resolvers\r\n             instead of local dnsmasq when attempting to\r\n             resolve addresses, for improved reliability.\r\n             This reproduces how stock firmware behaves.\r\n             This only affects name resolution done\r\n             by the router itself, not by the LAN clients.\r\n             The behaviour can still be changed on the\r\n             Tools -> Other Settings page.\r\n  - CHANGED: Randomize the serial number of certificates\r\n             generated by the router for its httpd.  If\r\n             using a router-generated certificate, then\r\n             it's recommended to generate a new one.\r\n  - CHANGED: Allow USB idle values up to 9999.\r\n  - CHANGED: Replaced Network Analysis and Netstat pages (under\r\n             Network Tools) with new versions based on Asus's\r\n             Netool daemon for non-HND models, but based\r\n             around the more limited traceroute busybox applet.\r\n             RT-AC86U and RT-AX88U still use the newer\r\n             traceroute executable.\r\n  - CHANGED: Reworked how some services are started when the WAN\r\n             interface comes up to prevent deadlocks between\r\n             the WAN completing its initialisation, and the\r\n             clock getting set.  These could result is fairly\r\n             long boot time for some ISPs.\r\n  - FIXED: openvpn-event script not launching if the\r\n           client was configured in Secret Key auth\r\n           mode.\r\n  - FIXED: IPv6 issues on RT-AX88U - backported accept_ra fix\r\n           from 45717 (themiron)\r\n  - FIXED: Memory leak in erp_monitor process.\r\n  - FIXED: Page redirection failing to apply at boot\r\n           time if WAN was down.\r\n  - FIXED: CVE-2019-11477, CVE-2019-11478 and\r\n           CVE-2019-11479 (themiron)\r\n\r\n\r\n384.11_2 (18-May-2019)\r\n  - NEW: Implemented source/destination IP filtering\r\n         for the Netool version of Netstat web page.\r\n  - CHANGED: Backported multiple fixes and improvements\r\n             for ntpd from upstream, improving handling\r\n             of failed server hostname resolution, and better\r\n             clock sync discipline.\r\n  - FIXED: RT-AC88U/3100/5300 were accidentally compiled\r\n           with Netool enabled, which isn't compatible with\r\n           these model's kernel.\r\n  - FIXED: Movistar stopped working for some users.  Re-disabled\r\n           udpxy on Movistar profile for now.  A more complete\r\n           fix will have to come from Asus.\r\n  - FIXED: Re-disabled memaccess debugging tool, as it creates\r\n           a symlink called \"sh\" which is a pretty bad\r\n          idea from Broadcom. (RT-AC86U, RT-AX88U)\r\n\r\n\r\n384.11 (8-May-2019)\r\n  - NEW: Added DNS Privacy feature, with support for\r\n         DNS-over-TLS (also known as DoT).\r\n         You can configure it on the WAN -> Internet Connection\r\n         page.  You can manually add your own servers, or chose\r\n         one (or a few) from the preset list.  (themiron)\r\n  - NEW: NTP daemon on the router, to allow your LAN clients to\r\n         synchronize their clocks with it.\r\n  - NEW: Option to intercept NTP requests from clients, and\r\n         redirect them to the router's own NTP daemon.\r\n  - NEW: Added service-event-end custom script, executed at the\r\n         end of an rc service call.  Receives the same arguments\r\n         as service-event, but is a non-blocking script.\r\n  - NEW: Added sqlite3 CLI command, to allow script authors to\r\n         create/manage their own sqlite3 database\r\n  - UPDATED: RT-AX88U to 384_5951 GPL.\r\n  - UPDATED: Other models to 384_45713 GPL (RT-AC87U, RT-AC3200\r\n             and RT-AC5300 still using 384_45149 binary blobs)\r\n  - UPDATED: Nano 4.0.\r\n  - UPDATED: Curl 7.64.1.\r\n  - UPDATED: Dropbear 2019.78.\r\n  - CHANGED: Replaced the custom ntpclient with a proper ntpd\r\n             implementation, for reduced memory usage and\r\n             increased accuracy.\r\n  - CHANGED: Made the secondary NTP server configurable through the\r\n             webui.  Note that ntpd will use both servers, so clear\r\n             the second server if there is one and you don't want\r\n             to use it.\r\n  - CHANGED: Re-designed firmware upgrade page, moving the schedule\r\n             option to that page, and removed support for the Beta\r\n             channel.\r\n  - CHANGED: Removed popup messages showing on the DDNS page when\r\n             a service state change was detected.  Report it within\r\n             the page instead.\r\n  - CHANGED: Report firmware version within the new firmware\r\n             notification popup that appears at the top of the webui.\r\n  - CHANGED: Moved LED control (formerly known as Stealth Mode) to\r\n             the System page.\r\n  - CHANGED: Do not restart whole network whenever changing an IP\r\n             reservation on the Networkmap card.\r\n  - CHANGED: Allow URLs up to 64 chars long on the URL filter.\r\n  - CHANGED: pre-mount user script now receives the filesystem\r\n             as second argument.\r\n  - CHANGED: Moved various DNS-related settings from the DHCP page\r\n             to a more appropriate location on the WAN page.\r\n  - CHANGED: OpenSSL default dir moved to /etc/ssl/.  Allows\r\n             programs to automatically locate the CA bundle\r\n             without requiring explicit configuration.\r\n  - CHANGED: Optimized service restarts generated by the\r\n             System page.\r\n  - CHANGED: Replaced Network Analysis and Netstat pages (under\r\n             Network Tools) with new versions based on Asus's\r\n             Netool daemon (RT-AC86U, RT-AX88U)\r\n  - FIXED: Reboot scheduler would sometime get stuck, or corrupt\r\n           plugged USB drives.  Now doing a more thorough\r\n           shutdown of services, should hopefully make it\r\n           more reliable.\r\n  - FIXED: CVE-2019-1543 issue with Chacha20-poly1305 in\r\n           OpenSSL 1.1 (themiron)\r\n  - FIXED: Client count on the Sysinfo page was missing\r\n           Guest clients\r\n  - FIXED: Miniupnpd sometimes sending ssdp notifies to\r\n           the wrong interface (themiron)\r\n  - FIXED: udpxy not working when using the Movistar\r\n           IPTV profile on RT-AC86U and RT-AX88U.\r\n\r\n\r\n384.10_2 (3-Apr-2019)\r\n  - CHANGED: Increased OpenVPN interface queue length from 100\r\n             to 1000 bytes, to reduce the amount of dropped\r\n             packets if router can't keep up.\r\n  - CHANGED: Updated CA bundle to January 23rd version\r\n  - FIXED: Moviestar VLAN routes weren't properly configured\r\n           (broken quagga configuration)\r\n  - FIXED: Layout issues on the Wireless Log page for some\r\n           models\r\n  - FIXED: Missing tooltip content for the new local DNS\r\n           resolution setting on the Tweak page\r\n  - FIXED: FAQ URL on Bandwidth Monitor points to a non-existing\r\n           page on Asus's servers (point to old page for now)\r\n  - FIXED: OpenVPN CA would be overwritten if there was no\r\n           server key or cert present - only generate them\r\n           if all three are missing.\r\n  - FIXED: Bandwidth Limiter not working properly in some\r\n           cases, as it failed to disable hardware acceleration\r\n\r\n\r\n384.10 (24-March-2019)\r\n  - NEW: Added OpenSSL 1.1.1b in parallel to 1.0.2.  Some services\r\n         like AiCloud are still linked against 1.0.2 because they\r\n         would require Asus to recompile them against 1.1.1.\r\n\r\n         Main services that currently use OpenSSL 1.1.1:\r\n         httpd (webui), OpenVPN, wget, net-snmp, Tor,\r\n         Strongswan (IPSEC server), inadyn, vsftpd, avahi.\r\n\r\n         Models that lack AES acceleration will prioritize the use\r\n         of CHACHA20 over AES-256-GCM, for a small performance\r\n         improvement (for instance with the webui).\r\n\r\n         Note that OpenVPN 2.4.7's support is still limited.\r\n         TLS 1.3 is supported, but CHACHA20 support is\r\n         only expected with OpenVPN 2.5.0.\r\n\r\n         The 1.0.2 userspace tool is still named \"openssl\", while\r\n         the 1.1.x version is named \"openssl11\".\r\n\r\n  - NEW: Updated RT-AX88U to GPL 384_5640.\r\n  - NEW: Implemented lcp-ident option in PPP (required by some ISPs)\r\n         (Themiron).\r\n  - NEW: Added NFSv2 support to HND models.\r\n  - NEW: You can now choose between having your router do internal\r\n         DNS queries locally (through dnsmasq) or with your WAN\r\n         configured DNS (like stock firmware).  This does not\r\n         affect DNS lookups from your clients, only those made\r\n         by the router itself.  The option is under Tools ->\r\n         Other Settings.  (Themiron)\r\n  - CHANGED: Some firmware cleanups to regain flash space (for\r\n             use with the parallel OpenSSL 1.1.x install)\r\n             (RMerlin, Themiron)\r\n  - CHANGED: Updated curl to 7.64.0.\r\n  - CHANGED: Updated OpenVPN to 2.4.7.\r\n  - CHANGED: Updated Tor to 0.3.5.8.\r\n  - CHANGED: Updated strongswan to 5.7.2.\r\n  - CHANGED: Updated OpenSSL 1.0.x to 1.0.2r.\r\n  - CHANGED: Updated dnsmasq to 2.80-44-g608aa9f (Themiron)\r\n  - CHANGED: Re-worked the Classification page.

Doing so carries serious potential\r\n              security risks, as Asuswrt's web server code should\r\n              not be considered hardened enough for this.\r\n   - FIXED: Security issue in httpd (CVE-2018-8879).\r\n   - FIXED: Potential security issue in httpd related to QiS.\r\n   - FIXED: Minor webui issue in the QoS overhead menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n384.4 (16-Mar-2018)\r\n   - NEW: Merged with GPL 384_20379 (with some binary components\r\n          from 382_50010 and 384_20308 depending on models)\r\n   - NEW: Added support for the RT-AC5300.\r\n   - NEW: Added support for the RT-AC87U.\r\n   - NEW: Added IPSEC support to the RT-AC86U.\r\n   - NEW: Support the new Entware 64-bit repo on the RT-AC86U.\r\n          To switch to the new repository, re-run the\r\n          entware-setup.sh script.  You will need to reinstall\r\n          your apps (your old config files are backed up on\r\n          your USB disk).\r\n   - CHANGED: Tightened security around some config files.\r\n   - CHANGED: Allow guest networks settings for AP isolation\r\n              and SSID broadcast to be set separately from\r\n              their parent interface (John Bacho)\r\n   - CHANGED: Samba protocol support can now be set to\r\n              SMBv1, SMBv2, or SMBv1 + SMBv2 (the new default).\r\n              This will result in a performance drop on all\r\n              models but the RT-AC86U, but will be more secure.\r\n              Ideally, people should change it to SMBv2 only,\r\n              and then reboot all their client devices to start\r\n              using only the new protocol.\r\n   - CHANGED: Re-added some of the logging sd-idle used to do\r\n              in 380.xx.\r\n   - CHANGED: Switched to the new Entware repo for armv7 models.\r\n              To upgrade, run the following commands TWICE:\r\n\r\n              opkg update; opkg upgrade\r\n\r\n   - FIXED: Resetting an OpenVPN client to default settings\r\n            might revert back after a reboot.\r\n   - FIXED: log flood from lldpd about \"unable to send packet\r\n            on real device\" (moved to debug level)\r\n   - FIXED: Potential racing condition that could lead to two\r\n            instances of miniupnpd running at boot time.\r\n   - FIXED: Single-char hostnames were rejected by DHCP static\r\n            leasees page.

NOTE: Due to various issues with GPL 382_18991, the 382.2\r\n           release is being dropped, and work is moving on to the\r\n           next version.  382.2 beta releases remain available\r\n           for those who still wish to use it (especially RT-AC56U\r\n           users for whom there is no ETA as to when Asus will\r\n           release the next GPL for that particular model.)\r\n           Known issues include lack of PPPoE HW acceleration and\r\n           Adaptive QoS sometimes failing to start at boot among\r\n           others.\r\n\r\n   - NOTE: The official IRC channel has moved to\r\n           Freenode (#asuswrt).\r\n\r\n   - NEW: Merged with GPL 382_18991.\r\n          Most notable changes (will vary between models):\r\n            - Added IPSec VPN server\r\n            - Added IFTTT and Alexa support\r\n            - Let's Encrypt support (DDNS page)\r\n            - Better support for some longer settings (RT-AC86U)\r\n   - NEW: Merged HND SDK + binary components from 382_18848\r\n          (RT-AC86U)\r\n   -

CHANGED: Moved HTTPS cert management to the DDNS page (where\r\n              Asus has put theirs, as Let's Encrypt is tied to\r\n              the DDNS configuration)\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.2n.\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated tor to 0.2.9.14.\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated nano to 2.9.1.\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated curl to 7.57.0.\r\n   - CHANGED: Increased max length for OpenVPN custom settings from\r\n              170 to 510 characters on RT-AC86U.\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated miniupnod to Github snapshot 20171212.\r\n   - CHANGED: OpenVPN firewall rules are now processed after the\r\n              various security chains (access restriction, network\r\n              service firewall, etc...), ensuring OVPN traffic no\r\n              longer bypasses them.\r\n   - FIXED: httpd crash on certain web pages if there are no Ethernet\r\n            clients connected\r\n   - FIXED: DNSFILTER rules would have priority over OPENVPN Client\r\n            rules (when client has DNS set to Exclusive mode).\r\n   - FIXED: traffic routing from the router itself would fail when\r\n            restarting the firewall while using an ovpn client with\r\n            policy rules in effect.\r\n   - FIXED: Dashes were rejected when used in an OpenVPN policy\r\n            client description.\r\n   - REMOVED: Removed option to select between active and passive\r\n              scan mode for a site survey (that code is now closed\r\n              source and therefore that option can no longer be\r\n              implemented).\r\n\r\n\r\n382.1_2 (2-Dec-2017)\r\n   - NEW: Added custom/add/postconf support for mcpd.conf (RT-AC86U)\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated odhcp6c to latest upstream version\r\n              (patch by theMIRon)\r\n   - CHANGED: cifs and xt_set kernel modules will get automatically\r\n              loaded as needed.\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated openssl to 1.0.2m.\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated libogg to 1.3.3 and libvorbis to 1.3.5.\r\n   - CHANGED: Merged wireless components from GPL 382_18991 for\r\n              RT-AC88U and RT-AC3100 (should in theory fix KRACK\r\n              issue on these two models)\r\n   - FIXED: allow IA_NA mode downgrade with forced IA_PD\r\n            (for ISPs with broken IPv6 support)\r\n            (patch by theMIRon)\r\n   - FIXED: SSH brute force protection would break WAN\r\n            connectivity (RT-AC86U)\r\n   - FIXED: Wrong Trend Micro signature updater was used when\r\n            compiling with FW update checker enabled.\r\n   - FIXED: QoS Upload chart missing on PPPoE connections with\r\n            Adaptive QoS enabled.\r\n   - FIXED: client and vendor id fields on WAN page would fail\r\n            to accept new values longer than 32 characters.\r\n   - FIXED: The Desc field in the OpenVPN policy section would\r\n            reject \":\" if field contained a MAC address.\r\n   - FIXED: Security issues CVE-2017-15275, CVE-2017-12163 and\r\n            CVE-2017-12150 (backported to Samba 3.6 and 3.5)\r\n   - FIXED: DHCP static lease list would refuse any change if\r\n            the list of leases+hostnames was longer than 1000\r\n            chars due to an HND platform limitation (RT-AC86U)\r\n\r\n\r\n382.1 (12-Nov-2017)\r\n   Asuswrt-Merlin 382 was rebuilt from a clean GPL codebase, as\r\n   merging the new 382 GPL on top of the existing code proved too\r\n   difficult.\r\n\r\n   For simplicity, the following abbreviations are used below:\r\n      AM380 = Asuswrt-Merlin 380.xxx\r\n      AM382 = Asuswrt-Merlin 382.xxx\r\n      Asus380 = Asus's 3.0.0.4.380_xxxx\r\n      Asus382 = Asus's 3.0.0.4.382_xxxx\r\n\r\n   AM382.1 is based on AM380.68_4 merged on top of a clean\r\n   3.0.0.4.382_15098 GPL.\r\n\r\n   At this time, only the RT-AC86U, RT-AC88U and RT-AC3100\r\n   are supported by AM382.  Other models will gradually be\r\n   moved to AM382 as Asus upgrade them to the new 382 code\r\n   base (and GPL code becomes available for them).\r\n\r\n   This changelog will focus on changes that happened between\r\n   AM380.68 and AM382.1, or between Asus382_16466 and AM382.\r\n\r\n   Also note that the primary download site was changed to\r\n   Sourceforge, due to numerous issues with Mediafire.  Onedrive\r\n   will be the official mirror to the SF.net download site.\r\n\r\n   - NEW: Moved to Asus382 codebase.  Some of the most important\r\n          changes between Asus380 and Asus382:\r\n            - New Trend Micro DPI engine, with two-way IPS\r\n            - New networkmap service (now closed source)\r\n            - New OpenVPN implementation (now closed source,\r\n              not used by AM382)\r\n            - Numerous security enhancements throughout the code\r\n\r\n   - NEW: Merged with GPL 382_16466 (RT-AC86U).\r\n   - NEW: Added support for the RT-AC86U and its Broadcom HND\r\n          platform (HND SDK from GPL 382_18219).\r\n          Note that IPTraffic is not supported by this model due to\r\n          its newer Linux kernel.\r\n   - NEW: Rewrote part of the OpenVPN implementation, as Asus's own\r\n          is now closed source.  Asuswrt-Merlin's OpenVPN code will\r\n          now be independent of Asus's.\r\n   - NEW: Added support for inline CRLs when importing an ovpn file\r\n   - NEW: Added support for fullcone NAT (RT-AC86U)\r\n   - NEW: Added WiFi Radar (Broadcom's Visualization app) in the\r\n          Wireless section.  You must enable data collection on\r\n          its Configuration page for all charts to work properly.\r\n          (RT-AC86U)\r\n   - NEW: Added option to disable the Asus NAT tunnel service under\r\n          Other Settings -> Tweak.  Not quite sure what this\r\n          partly closed source service is for, but it eats a\r\n          fair amount of CPU and RAM.\r\n   - NEW: Option on OpenVPN Server page to quickly choose\r\n          between pushing LAN or LAN + Internet access (ported\r\n          from Asus382)\r\n   - NEW: Option to select the bitsize to use (1024 or 2048) when\r\n          automatically generating the OpenVPN server key/certs\r\n          (ported from Asus382)\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated wget to 1.19.2 (fixing connectivity to some\r\n              TLS 1.2 servers)\r\n   - CHANGED: SSH host keys are now stored in /jffs/ssl/ rather\r\n              than nvram.\r\n   - CHANGED: SMB2 is enabled by default on RT-AC86U (no performance\r\n              penalty on that platform)\r\n   - CHANGED: Moved UPnP Secure Mode setting from the Tweaks section\r\n              to the WAN page, next to other UPnP settings.\r\n   - CHANGED: Moved \"Modify key and certs\" link to its own dedicated\r\n              row and made it a button for improved visibility\r\n              (OpenVPN client & server pages)\r\n   - CHANGED: Updated OpenVPN to 2.4.4.\r\n   - CHANGED: The firmware version check behaviour was slightly\r\n              changed.  The \"Get Beta\" checkbox will now check\r\n              both the Beta and the Release channels for new\r\n              version availability.  Automatic scheduled checks\r\n              will still only check the Release channel.\r\n   - CHANGED: Layout improvements to the SNMP, Login, and\r\n              Operation Mode pages (patches by Alin Trăistaru)\r\n   - CHANGED: Report both the local client IP as well as the\r\n              public/visible IP on the OpenVPN client page once\r\n              a client is connected (same info that was already\r\n              available on the VPN Status page).\r\n   - CHANGED: Moved Disk spindown settings to the System page,\r\n              to match with Asus382 which now offers this feature.\r\n   - REMOVED: Obsolete/exotic HMAC digests for OpenVPN servers (to\r\n              match with Asus' own supported list)\r\n   - REMOVED: \"Custom\" OpenVPN authentication mode (which probably\r\n              nobody used or even understood).\r\n"

We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\f\r\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\r\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\nalong with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\n    parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\f\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n\r\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\r\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\f\r\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\f\r\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\r\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\f\r\n\t    \r\n"

          "content": "Asuswrt-Merlin\r\n==============\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\nAsuswrt is the name of the firmware Asus has developed for\r\ntheir various router models.  Originally forked from Tomato, \r\nit has since grown into a very different product, removing \r\nsome more technical features that were part of Tomato, but \r\nalso adding a lot of new original features.\r\n\r\nAsuswrt-merlin is a customized version of Asus's firmware. The goal is \r\nto provide bugfixes and minor enhancements to Asus's firmware, with also \r\na few occasional feature additions.  This is done while retaining \r\nthe look and feel of the original firmware, and also ensuring that \r\nthe two codebases remain close enough so it will remain possible \r\nto keep up with any new features brought by Asus in the original firmware.\r\n\r\nThis project's goal is NOT to develop yet another firmware filled with \r\nmany features that are rarely used by home users - that is already covered \r\nby other excellent projects such as Tomato or DD-WRT.\r\n\r\nThis more conservative approach will also help ensuring the highest \r\nlevel of stability possible.  Priority is given to stability over \r\nperformance, and performance over features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Devices\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nFully supported devices:\r\n\r\n386.x:\r\n * RT-AC66U_B1 (use the RT-AC68U firmware)\r\n * RT-AC68U, RT-AC68P, RT-AC68UF (including HW revision C1 and E1)\r\n * RT-AC68U V3 (use the RT-AC68U firmware)\r\n * RT-AC68U V4 (use the RT-AC68U firmware)\r\n * RT-AC1900 & RT-AC1900P (use the RT-AC68U firmware)\r\n * RT-AC88U\r\n * RT-AC3100\r\n * RT-AC5300\r\n * RT-AC86U\r\n * RT-AC2900 (use the RT-AC86U firmware)\r\n * GT-AC2900\r\n\r\n3004.388.x:\r\n * RT-AX88U\r\n * RT-AX58U & RT-AX3000 (V1 only)\r\n * RT-AX86U & RT-AX86S\r\n * GT-AX11000\r\n * RT-AX68U\r\n * GT-AXE11000\r\n * GT-AX6000\r\n * ZenWifi Pro XT12\r\n * GT-AX11000 Pro\r\n * GT-AXE16000\r\n * RT-AX86U Pro\r\n * RT-AX88U Pro\r\n\r\n3006.102.x:\r\n * RT-BE96U \r\n * GT-BE98_PRO\r\n\r\nNo longer supported:\r\n * RT-N16\r\n * RT-N66U\r\n * RT-AC66U\r\n * RT-AC56U\r\n * RT-AC87U\r\n * RT-AC3200\r\n * RT-AX56U\r\n\r\nNOTE: all the \"R\" versions (for example RT-N66R) are the same as their \r\n\"U\" counterparts, they are just different packages aimed at large \r\nretailers.  The firmware is 100% compatible with both U and R versions \r\nof the routers.  Same with the \"W\" variants that are simply white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\nHere is a list of features that Asuswrt-merlin adds over the original \r\nfirmware.\r\n\r\n(Note: HND platform = newer Broadcom models starting with RT-AC86U):\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n   - Various bugfixes\r\n   - Performance optimizations to some CPU-bound components like OpenVPN\r\n   - Some components were updated to their latest versions, for improved stability and security\r\n   - User scripts that run on specific events such as firewall restart\r\n   - Cron jobs for scheduled tasks\r\n   - Customizable config files for router services\r\n   - Third party software through Entware, with an easy setup script\r\n   - SNMP support (some models)\r\n   - Nano text editor (for more user-friendly script editing)\r\n   - NTP daemon, which can synchronize your client devices\r\n   - Third-party addons, with a management interface (AMTM)\r\n \r\n\r\nDisk sharing:\r\n   - Optionally use shorter share names (folder name only)\r\n   - NFS exporting of USB drives\r\n\r\n\r\nNetworking:\r\n   - Act as a SMB Master Browser\r\n   - Act as a WINS server\r\n   - Allows tweaking TCP/UDP connection tracking timeouts\r\n   - CIFS client support (for mounting remote SMB share on the router)\r\n   - Advanced OpenVPN client and server.\r\n   - Netfilter ipset module, for efficient blacklist implementation\r\n   - DNS Director - enforcing the use of a specific DNS server, can be applied globally or per client\r\n   - Wireless site survey page\r\n   - Custom DDNS (through a user script)\r\n   - TOR support, individual client access control\r\n   - VPN Director - Policy-based routing for OpenVPN and WireGUard clients (based on source or destination IPs)\r\n   - Detailed wireless troubleshooting information (on some models)\r\n   - Redirect NTP client queries to the router's own NTP daemon\r\n   - Cake SQM QoS (on newer HND models)\r\n \r\n\r\nWeb interface:\r\n   - Performance improvements\r\n   - Optionally save traffic stats to disk (USB or JFFS partition)\r\n   - Enhanced traffic monitoring: adding graphical charts, and traffic monitoring per client IP\r\n   - Hostname field on the DHCP reservation list and Wireless ACL list\r\n   - System info summary page\r\n   - Wifi icon reports the state of both radios\r\n   - Advanced wireless client list display, including automated refresh\r\n   - Redesigned layout of the various System Log sections\r\n   - Editable entries (on some pages)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that a number of features which first appeared in Asuswrt-Merlin\r\nhave since been integrated/implemented in the official firmware, such\r\nas OpenVPN support.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nSimply flash it like any regular update.  You should not need to \r\nreset to factory defaults (see note below for exceptions).\r\nYou can revert back to an original Asus firmware at any time just\r\nby flashing a firmware downloaded from Asus's website.\r\n\r\nNote that the archive for ROG models (like the GT-AX6000) may\r\ncontain two different firmware images.  The one with _rog in\r\nthe filename uses the original ROG themed user interface, while\r\nthe other one uses the traditionnal blue/grey visuals used by\r\nnon-ROG models.\r\n\r\nIf the firmware upgrade fails, try rebooting your router to free \r\nup sufficient memory, without any USB disk plugged in,\r\nthen try flashing it again.\r\n\r\nNOTE: resetting to factory default after flashing is \r\nstrongly recommended for the following cases:\r\n\r\n- Updating from a firmware version that is more than 3 releases older\r\n- Switching from a Tomato/DD-WRT/OpenWRT firmware\r\n\r\nIf you run into any issue after an upgrade and you haven't done so,\r\ntry doing a factory default reset as well.\r\n\r\nAlways read the changelog, as mandatory resets will be mentionned \r\nthere when they are necessary.\r\n\r\nIn all of these cases, do NOT load a saved copy of your settings!\r\nThis would be the same thing as NOT resetting at all, as you will \r\nsimply re-enter any invalid setting you wanted to get rid of.  Make \r\nsure to create a new backup of your settings after reconfiguring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\nFor documentation on how to use the features that are specific to \r\nAsuswrt-Merlin, as well as additional guides, please consult the\r\nwiki:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/wiki\r\n\r\nThere are also support forums hosted at SNBForums.\r\n\r\nFirmware support: https://www.snbforums.com/forums/asuswrt-merlin.42/\r\nAddOns support: https://www.snbforums.com/forums/asuswrt-merlin-addons.60/\r\n\r\n\r\nSource code\r\n-----------\r\nThe source code can be found on Github:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng\r\n\r\nOriginal pre-382.xx legacy code (now archived):\r\nhttps://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin\r\n\r\n   \r\nContact information\r\n-------------------\r\nSmallNetBuilder forums (preferred method: https://www.snbforums.com/forums/asuswrt-merlin.42/ as RMerlin)\r\nWebsite: https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net/\r\nGithub: https://github.com/RMerl\r\nEmail: merlin@asuswrt-merlin.net\r\nMAstodon: https://fosstodon.org/@RMerlin\r\nIRC: RMerlin in channel #asuswrt on Libera\r\nDownload: https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net/download\r\n\r\nDevelopment news will be posted on Mastodon, and the support forums.\r\nYou can also keep a closer eye on development as it happens,\r\nthrough the Github code repository.\r\n\r\nFor support questions, please use the SmallNetBuilder forums whenever \r\npossible.  There's a dedicated Asuswrt-Merlin sub-forum there, under \r\nthe Asus Wireless section.  The community there is the primary source \r\nof technical support.\r\n\r\nI want to give my special thanks to Asus for showing an interest in \r\nthis project, and also providing me with support and development \r\ndevices when needed.  I also want to thank everyone that has \r\ndonated through Paypal.  Much appreciated!\r\n\r\nFinally, my special thanks to r00t4rd3d for designing the \r\nAsuswrt-Merlin logo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThis is the part where you usually put a lot of legalese stuff that nobody \r\nreads. I'm not a lawyer, so I'll just make it simple, using my own words \r\nrather than some pre-crafted text that will bore you to death and that \r\nnobody but a highly paid lawyer would even understand anyway:\r\n\r\nI take no responsibility for issues caused by this project. I do my best to \r\nensure that everything works fine. If something goes wrong, my apologies.\r\n\r\nThe Asuswrt-merlin firmware is released under a GPL licence.  In short, you \r\nare free to use, redistribute and modify it, as long as all the associated \r\nlicences are respected, and that any changes you make to the GPL code is \r\nmade publicly available.\r\n\r\nCopyrights belong to the appropriate individuals/entities, under the appropriate \r\nlicences. GPL code is covered by GPL, proprietary code is Copyright their \r\nrespective owners, yadda yadda.\r\n\r\nI try my best to honor the licences (as far as I can understand them, as a \r\nnormal human being). Anything GPL or otherwise open-sourced that I modify \r\nwill see my changes published to Github at some point. A release might get \r\ndelayed if I'm working using pre-release code. If it's GPL, it will eventually \r\nbe published - no need to send a volley of legal threats at me.\r\n\r\nIn any other cases not covered, Common Sense prevails, and I shall also make use \r\nof Good Will.\r\n\r\nConcerning privacy:\r\n\r\nThe only call back made by this firmware to me is when it checks for the\r\navailability of a new version.  The automated check can be disabled if desired.\r\nMore info on the Wiki:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/wiki/Privacy-disclosure\r\n\r\n\r\n--- \r\nEric Sauvageau\r\n"

While some features do get added, this is not the main focus of this project.  \nIt is not meant to replace existing projects such as Tomato or DD-WRT, but rather to offer an alternative \nfor people who prefer the original firmware featureset.\n\nThis is the new development branch, originally based on Asus's \n3.0.0.4.382_xxxx firmware release.  Development of the 380.xx \nlegacy branch has been dropped.\n\nPlease consult the Wiki for an up-to-date list of supported models:\n\nhttps://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/wiki/Supported-Devices\n"
