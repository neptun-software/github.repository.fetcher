          "content": "# Building Guide\n\nThis guide will help you build the project on your local machine. The process will require you to provide a decompressed ROM of the US version of the game.\n\nThese steps cover: decompressing the ROM, running the recompiler and finally building the project.\n\n## 1. Clone the Zelda64Recomp Repository\nThis project makes use of submodules so you will need to clone the repository with the `--recurse-submodules` flag.\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recurse-submodules\n# if you forgot to clone with --recurse-submodules\n# cd /path/to/cloned/repo && git submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n## 2. Install Dependencies\n\n### Linux\nFor Linux the instructions for Ubuntu are provided, but you can find the equivalent packages for your preferred distro.\n\n```bash\n# For Ubuntu, simply run:\nsudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build libsdl2-dev libgtk-3-dev lld llvm clang\n```\n\n### Windows\nYou will need to install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).\nIn the setup process you'll need to select the following options and tools for installation:\n- Desktop development with C++\n- C++ Clang Compiler for Windows\n- C++ CMake tools for Windows\n\nThe other tool necessary will be `make` which can be installe via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):\n```bash\nchoco install make\n```\n\n## 3. Decompressing the target ROM\nYou will need to decompress the NTSC-U N64 Majora's Mask ROM (sha1: d6133ace5afaa0882cf214cf88daba39e266c078) before running the recompiler.\n\nThere are a few tools that can do it:\n* This python script from the Majora's Mask decompilation project: https://github.com/zeldaret/mm/blob/main/tools/buildtools/decompress_baserom.py\n* https://github.com/z64tools/z64decompress\n\nRegardless of which method you use, copy the decompressed ROM to the root of the Zelda64Recomp repository with this filename:\n- `mm.us.rev1.rom_uncompressed.z64`\n\n## 4. Generating the C code\n\nNow that you have the required files, you must build [N64Recomp](https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp) and run it to generate the C code to be compiled. The building instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp?tab=readme-ov-file#building). That will build the executables: `N64Recomp` and `RSPRecomp` which you should copy to the root of the Zelda64Recomp repository.\n\nAfter that, go back to the repository root, and run the following commands:\n```bash\n./N64Recomp us.rev1.toml\n./RSPRecomp aspMain.us.rev1.toml\n./RSPRecomp njpgdspMain.us.rev1.toml\n```\n\n## 5. Building the Project\n\nFinally, you can build the project! :rocket:\n\nOn Windows, you can open the repository folder with Visual Studio, and you'll be able to `[build / run / debug]` the project from there.\n\nIf you prefer the command line or you're on a Unix platform you can build the project using CMake:\n\n```bash\ncmake -S . -B build-cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # or Debug if you want to debug\ncmake --build build-cmake --target Zelda64Recompiled -j$(nproc) --config Release # or Debug\n```\n\n## 6. Success\n\nVoilÃ ! You should now have a `Zelda64Recompiled` executable in the build directory! If you used Visual Studio this will be `out/build/x64-[Configuration]` and if you used the provided CMake commands then this will be `build-cmake`. You will need to run the executable out of the root folder of this project or copy the assets folder to the build folder to run it.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> In the game itself, you should be using a standard ROM, not the decompressed one.\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.

          "content": "# Zelda 64: Recompiled\nZelda 64: Recompiled is a project that uses [N64: Recompiled](https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp) to **statically recompile** Majora's Mask (and soon Ocarina of Time) into a native port with many new features and enhancements. This project uses [RT64](https://github.com/rt64/rt64) as the rendering engine to provide some of these enhancements.\n\n### [Check out the latest release here](https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp/releases/latest).\n\n### **This repository and its releases do not contain game assets. The original game is required to build or run this project.**\n\n<div align=\"left\" valign=\"middle\">\n<a href=\"https://runblaze.dev\">\n <picture>\n   <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://www.runblaze.dev/logo_dark.png\">\n   <img align=\"right\" src=\"https://www.runblaze.dev/logo_light.png\" height=\"102px\"/>\n </picture>\n</a>\n\n<br style=\"display: none;\"/>\n\n_Thank you [Blaze](https://runblaze.dev) for supporting this project by providing Linux ARM64 and Apple Silicon macOS Github Action Runners!_\n\n</div>\n\n## Table of Contents\n* [System Requirements](#system-requirements)\n* [Features](#features)\n  * [Plug and Play](#plug-and-play)\n  * [Fully Intact N64 Effects](#fully-intact-n64-effects)\n  * [Easy-to-Use Menus](#easy-to-use-menus)\n  * [High Framerate Support](#high-framerate-support)\n  * [Widescreen and Ultrawide Support](#widescreen-and-ultrawide-support)\n  * [Dual Analog Camera](#dual-analog-camera)\n  * [Gyro Aim](#gyro-aim)\n  * [Additional Control Options](#additional-control-options)\n  * [Autosaving](#autosaving)\n  * [Low Input Lag](#low-input-lag)\n  * [Instant Load Times](#instant-load-times)\n  * [Linux and Steam Deck Support](#linux-and-steam-deck-support)\n* [Planned Features](#planned-features)\n* [FAQ](#faq)\n* [Known Issues](#known-issues)\n* [Building](#building)\n* [Libraries Used and Projects Referenced](#libraries-used-and-projects-referenced)\n\n## System Requirements\nA GPU supporting Direct3D 12.0 (Shader Model 6) or Vulkan 1.2 is required to run this project. The oldest GPUs that should be supported for each vendor are:\n* GeForce GT 630\n* Radeon HD 7750 (the one from 2012, not to be confused with the RX 7000 series) and newer\n* Intel HD 510 (Skylake)\n\nA CPU supporting the AVX instruction set is also required (Intel Core 2000 series or AMD Bulldozer and newer).\n\nIf you have issues with crashes on startup, make sure your graphics drivers are fully up to date. \n\n## Features\n\n#### Plug and Play\nSimply provide your copy of the North American version of the game in the main menu and start playing! This project will automatically load assets from the provided copy, so there is no need to go through a separate extraction step or build the game yourself. Other versions of the game may be supported in the future.\n\n#### Fully Intact N64 Effects\nA lot of care was put into RT64 to make sure all graphical effects were rendered exactly as they did originally on the N64. No workarounds or \"hacks\" were made to replicate these effects, with the only modifications to them being made for enhancement purposes such as widescreen support. This includes framebuffer effects like the grayscale cutscenes and the Deku bubble projectile, depth effects like the lens of truth, decals such as shadows or impact textures, accurate lighting, shading effects like the fire arrows and bomb explosions, and various textures that are often rendered incorrectly.\n\n#### Easy-to-Use Menus\nGameplay settings, graphics settings, input mappings, and audio settings can all be configured with the in-game config menu. The menus can all be used with mouse, controller, or keyboard for maximum convenience.\n\n#### High Framerate Support\nPlay at any framerate you want thanks to functionality provided by RT64! Game objects and terrain, texture scrolling, screen effects, and most HUD elements are all rendered at high framerates. By default, this project is configured to run at your monitor's refresh rate. You can also play at the original framerate of the game if you prefer. **Changing framerate has no effect on gameplay.**\n\n**Note**: External framerate limiters (such as the NVIDIA Control Panel) are known to potentially cause problems, so if you notice any stuttering then turn them off and use the manual framerate slider in the in-game graphics menu instead.\n\n#### Widescreen and Ultrawide Support\nAny aspect ratio is supported, with most effects modded to work correctly in widescreen. The HUD can also be positioned at 16:9 when using ultrawide aspect ratios if preferred.\n\n**Note**: Some animation quirks can be seen at the edges of the screen in certain cutscenes when using very wide aspect ratios.\n\n#### Dual Analog Camera\nPlay with a dual analog control layout like later entries in the series! When this option is enabled, the right stick will control the camera. You can still have the C-Buttons mapped to the right stick if you so wish, so long as you also map them to other buttons on the controller. The right stick C-button inputs will be \"silenced\", except when you take out the ocarina, so you can still play the ocarina with the right stick.\n\n#### Gyro Aim\nWhen playing with a supported controller, first-person items such as the bow can be aimed with your controller's gyro sensor. This includes (but is not limited to) controllers such as the Dualshock 4, Dualsense, Switch Pro, and most third party Switch controllers (such as the 8BitDo Pro 2 in Switch mode).\n\n**Note**: Gamepad mappers such as BetterJoy or DS4Windows may intercept gyro data and prevent the game from receiving it. Most controllers are natively supported, so turning gamepad mappers off is recommended if you want to use gyro.\n\n#### Additional Control Options\nCustomize your experience by setting your stick deadzone to your liking, as well as adjusting the X and Y axis inversion for both aiming and the optional dual analog camera.\n\n#### Autosaving\nNever worry about losing progress if your power goes out thanks to autosaving! The autosave system is designed to respect Majora's Mask's original save system and maintain the intention of owl saves by triggering automatically and replacing the previous autosave or owl save. However, if you'd still rather play with the untouched save system, simply turn off autosaving in the ingame menu.\n\n#### Low Input Lag\nThis project has been optimized to have as little input lag as possible, making the game feel more responsive than ever!\n\n#### Instant Load Times\nSaving and loading files, going from place to place, and pausing all happen in the blink of an eye thanks to the game running natively on modern hardware.\n\n#### Linux and Steam Deck Support\nA Linux binary is available for playing on most up-to-date distros, including on the Steam Deck.\n\nTo play on Steam Deck, extract the Linux build onto your deck. Then, in desktop mode, right click the Zelda64Recompiled executable file and select \"Add to Steam\". From there, you can return to Gaming mode and configure the controls as needed. See the [Steam Deck gyro aim FAQ section](#how-do-i-set-up-gyro-aiming-on-steam-deck) for more detailed instructions.\n\n## Planned Features\n* Ocarina of Time support\n* Mod support and Randomizer\n* Texture Packs\n* Model Replacements\n* Ray Tracing (via RT64)\n* Multi-language support with support for loading custom translations\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### What is static recompilation?\nStatic recompilation is the process of automatically translating an application from one platform to another. For more details, check out the full description of how this project's recompilation works here: [N64: Recompiled](https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp).\n\n#### How is this related to the decompilation project?\nUnlike N64 ports in the past, this project is not based on the source code provided by a decompilation of the game. This is because static recompilation bypasses the need for decompiled source code when making a port, allowing ports to be made **without source code**. However, the reverse engineering work done by the decompilation team was invaluable for providing some of the enhancements featured in this project. For this reason, the project uses headers and some functions from the decompilation project in order to make modifications to the game. Many thanks to the decompilation team for all of the hard work they've done.\n\n#### How do I set up gyro aiming on Steam Deck?\nThis project provides mouse aiming as a way to allow using gyro on Steam Deck, as the Steam Deck's gyro sensors cannot be read directly. First, launch the game in Gaming Mode, press the Steam button and go to \"Controller Settings\". Choose \"Controller Settings\" again in the menu that follows, and then set \"Gyro Behavior\" to \"As Mouse\".\n\n![Controller Settings menu](docs/deck_gyro_1.jpg)\n\nYou'll probably also want to change the default behavior so that you don't need to be touching the right stick to allow gyro input. To do so, click on the Gear icon to the right of \"Gyro Behavior\" and ensure that \"Gyro Activation Buttons\" is set to \"None Selected (Gyro Always On).\" If this isn't the case, then select that option and then press \"Select None\" in the following menu.\n\n#### Where is the savefile stored?\n- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Zelda64Recompiled\\saves`\n- Linux: `~/.config/Zelda64Recompiled/saves`\n\n#### How do I choose a different ROM?\n**You don't.** This project is **only** a port of Majora's Mask (and Ocarina of Time in the future), and it will only accept one specific ROM: the US version of the N64 release of Majora's Mask. ROMs in formats other than .z64 will be automatically converted, as long as it is the correct ROM. **It is not an emulator and it cannot run any arbitrary ROM.** \n\nIf you want to play a modded ROM or in another language, note that support for modding and other languages will be added to the project itself in the future and will not rely on you supplying a different ROM. \n\n## Known Issues\n* Intel GPUs on Linux may not currently work. If you have experience with Vulkan development on Linux, help here would be greatly appreciated!\n* The prebuilt Linux binary may not work correctly on some distributions of Linux. If you encounter such an issue, building the project locally yourself is recommended. A Flatpak or AppImage may be provided in the future to solve this issue. Adding the Linux version to Steam and setting \"Steam Linux Runtime\" as the compatibility tool or launching it via Gamescope may work around the issue. Alternatively, running the Windows version with Proton is known to work well and may also work around this issue.\n* Overlays such as MSI Afterburner and other software such as Wallpaper Engine can cause performance issues with this project that prevent the game from rendering correctly. Disabling such software is recommended.\n\n## Building\nBuilding is not required to play this project, as prebuilt binaries (which do not contain game assets) can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp/releases) section. Instructions on how to build this project can be found in the [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) file.\n\n## Libraries Used and Projects Referenced\n* [RT64](https://github.com/rt64/rt64) for the project's rendering engine\n* [RmlUi](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi) for building the menus and launcher\n* [lunasvg](https://github.com/sammycage/lunasvg) for SVG rendering, used by RmlUi\n* [FreeType](https://freetype.org/) for font rendering, used by RmlUi  \n* [moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue](https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue) for semaphores and fast, lock-free MPMC queues\n* [Gamepad Motion Helpers](https://github.com/JibbSmart/GamepadMotionHelpers) for sensor fusion and calibration algorithms to implement gyro aiming\n* [Majora's Mask Decompilation](https://github.com/zeldaret/mm) for headers and some function definitions, used for making patches or some enhancements\n* [Ares emulator](https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares) for RSP vector instruction reference implementations, used in RSP recompilation\n\nSpecial thanks to [thecozies](https://github.com/thecozies) for designing and helping implement the launcher and config menus!\n"
