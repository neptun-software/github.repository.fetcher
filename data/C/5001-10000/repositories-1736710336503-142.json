Use `--prefix` to make an install in\nyour home directory. This is necessary to test python scripts. The systemd\nuser unit directory should be set to avoid writing to the system location.\n\nSystemd will look for the unit files in `~/.config/systemd/user` so this\ndirectory can be used as a target if the unit files will be used. Otherwise\nthe location can be set to `no` to disable the systemd files.\n\nExample:\n\n``` shell\n$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/redshift/root \\\n   --with-systemduserunitdir=$HOME/.config/systemd/user\n```\n\nNow, build the files:\n\n``` shell\n$ make\n```\n\nThe main redshift program can be run at this point. To install to the\nprefix directory run:\n\n``` shell\n$ make install\n```\n\nYou can now run the python script. Example:\n\n``` shell\n$ $HOME/redshift/root/bin/redshift-gtk\n```\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n* autotools, gettext\n* intltool, libtool\n* libdrm (Optional, for DRM support)\n* libxcb, libxcb-randr (Optional, for RandR support)\n* libX11, libXxf86vm (Optional, for VidMode support)\n* Glib 2 (Optional, for GeoClue2 support)\n\n* python3, pygobject, pyxdg (Optional, for GUI support)\n* appindicator (Optional, for Ubuntu-style GUI status icon)\n\nUbuntu users will find all these dependencies in the packages listed in ``.travis.yml``.\n\n\nCoding style for C code\n-----------------------\n\nRedshift follows roughly the Linux coding style\n<http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle>. Some specific rules to\nnote are:\n\n* Lines should not be longer than 80 characters in new code. If lines are\n  longer than this the code could likely be improved by moving some parts to a\n  smaller function.\n* All structures are typedef'ed.\n* Avoid Yoda conditions; they make the logic unnecessarily hard to comprehend.\n* Avoid multiline if-statements without braces; either use a single line or add\n  the braces.\n* Use only C-style comments (`/* */`).\n\n\nCreating a pull request\n-----------------------\n\n1. Create a topic branch for your specific changes. You can base this off the\n   master branch or a specific version tag if you prefer (`git co -b topic master`).\n2. Create a commit for each logical change on the topic branch. The commit log\n   must contain a one line description (max 80 chars). If you cannot describe\n   the commit in 80 characters you should probably split it up into multiple\n   commits. The first line can be followed by a blank line and a longer\n   description (split lines at 80 chars) for more complex commits. If the commit\n   fixes a known issue, mention the issue number in the first line (`Fix #11:\n   ...`).\n3. The topic branch itself should tackle one problem. Feel free to create many\n   topic branches and pull requests if you have many different patches. Putting\n   them into one branch makes it harder to review the code.\n4. Push the topic branch to Github, find it on github.com and create a pull\n   request to the master branch. If you are making a bug fix for a specific\n   release you can create a pull request to the release branch instead\n   (e.g. `release-1.9`).\n5. Discussion will ensue. If you are not prepared to partake in the discussion\n   or further improve your patch for inclusion, please say so and someone else\n   may be able to take on responsibility for your patch. Otherwise we will\n   assume that you will be open to criticism and suggestions for improvements\n   and that you will take responsibility for further improving the patch. You\n   can add further commits to your topic branch and they will automatically be\n   added to the pull request when you push them to Github.\n6. You may be asked to rebase the patch on the master branch if your patch\n   conflicts with recent changes to the master branch. However, if there is no\n   conflict, there is no reason to rebase. Please do not merge the master back\n   into your topic branch as that will convolute the history unnecessarily.\n7. Finally, when your patch has been refined, you may be asked to squash small\n   commits into larger commits. This is simply so that the project history is\n   clean and easy to follow. Remember that each commit should be able to stand\n   on its own, be able to compile and function normally. Commits that fix a\n   small error or adds a few comments to a previous commit should normally just\n   be squashed into that larger commit.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Git branching model that we use please see\n<http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/> but note that we use\nthe `master` branch as `develop`.\n\n\nContributing translations\n-------------------------\n\nYou can contribute translations directly at\n[Launchpad Translations for Redshift](https://translations.launchpad.net/redshift).\nUpdated translations will be pulled back into the `po` files on Github\nbefore a release is made.\n\n\nCreating a new release\n----------------------\n\n1. Select a commit in master to branch from, or if making a bugfix release\n   use previous release tag as base (e.g. for 1.9.1 use 1.9 as base)\n2. Create release branch `release-X.Y`\n3. Apply any bugfixes for release\n4. Import updated translations from launchpad and commit. Remember to update\n   `po/LINGUAS` if new languages were added\n5. Update version in `configure.ac` and create entry in NEWS\n6. Run `make distcheck`\n7. Commit and tag release (`vX.Y` or `vX.Y.Z`)\n8. Push tag to Github and also upload source dist file to Github\n\nAlso remember to check before release that\n\n* Windows build is ok\n* Build files for distributions are updated\n\n\nBuild Fedora RPMs\n-----------------\n\nRun `make dist-xz` and copy the `.tar.xz` file to `~/rpmbuild/SOURCES`. Then run\n\n``` shell\n$ rpmbuild -ba contrib/redshift.spec\n```\n\nIf successful this will place RPMs in `~/rpmbuild/RPMS`.\n\n\nCross-compile for Windows\n-------------------------\n\nInstall MinGW and run `configure` using the following command line. Use\n`i686-w64-mingw32` as host for 32-bit builds.\n\n``` shell\n$ ./configure --disable-drm --disable-randr --disable-vidmode --enable-wingdi \\\n  --disable-quartz --disable-geoclue2 --disable-corelocation --disable-gui \\\n  --disable-ubuntu --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32\n```\n\n\nNotes\n-----\n* verbose flag is (currently) only held in redshift.c; thus, write all\n  verbose messages there.\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

          "content": "This is a document describing how redshift works. It might be useful\nif the normal docs don't answer a question, or when you want to hack\non the code.\n\n\nPrograms\n========\n\nredshift\n--------\n\nredshift is a program written in C that tries to figure out the user's\nlocation during startup, and then goes into a loop setting the display\ngamma according to the time of day every couple seconds or minutes\n(details?).\n\nOn systems that support signals, it reacts to the SIGUSR1 signal by\nswitching to day/night immediately, and when receiving SIGINT or\nSIGTERM, it restores the screen gamma (to 6500K).\n\nRedshift knows short and long transitions, short transitions being\nused at start and when reacting to signals. Short transitions take\nabout 10 seconds; long transitions about 50 minutes.\n\nOnce running, redshift currently doesn't check location providers\nagain.\n\n\nredshift-gtk\n------------\n\nredshift-gtk is a small program written in Python that shows a status\nicon (what is an appindicator versus a GTK status icon?) (does it\nchange the icon according to internal program state of redshift? \ndoesn't seem so) and run an instance of the \"redshift\" program, and\nwill send it SIGUSR1 each time the user clicks the icon.\n\n\nAlternative Features\n====================\n\nRedshift interacts with the rest of the system in two ways: reading\nthe location, and setting the gamma. Both can be done in different\nways, and so for both areas there are configure options to\nenable/disable compilation of the various methods. ./configure --help\nshows more about what parts of the program that can be conditionally\ncompiled.\n\nNOTE: some features have to be disabled explicitely, like\n--disable-gnome-clock to prevent the gnome-clock code from being built\nin.\n\nThe two groups of features shall be called: \"location providers\" and\n\"adjustment methods\".\n\nThese are probably not the best names for these things but at least\nI've been mostly consistent with the naming throughout the source code\n(I hope).\n\nFirst adjustment methods: There is \"randr\" which is the preferred\nbecause it has support for multiple outputs per X screen which is lacking\nin \"vidmode\". Both are APIs in the X server that allow for manipulation\nof gamma ramps, which is what Redshift uses to change the screen color\ntemperature. There's also \"wingdi\" which is for the Windows version,\nand \"drm\" which allows manipulation of gamma ramps in a TTY in Linux.\n\nThen there are location providers: \"manual\", \"geoclue2\" and \"corelocation\".\nSome time ago there was only one way to specify the\nlocation which had to be done manually with the argument \"-l LAT:LON\".\nThen later, automatic \"location providers\" were added and the syntax\nhad to be changed to \"-l PROVIDER:OPTIONS\" where OPTIONS are arguments\nspecific to the provider. But to make people less confused about the\nchange I decided to still support the \"-l LAT:LON\" syntax, so if the\nPROVIDER is a number, the whole thing is parsed as LAT:LON. You could\nrun redshift with \"-l manual:lat=55:lon=12\" and get the same effect as\n\"-l 55:12\".\n\nSo there are currently two automatic location providers \"gnome-clock\"\nand \"geoclue\". From the beginning I was looking for a way to get the\nlocation automatically (from e.g. GPS) and Geoclue seemed like a good\nidea, but upon closer investigation it turned out to be horribly\nunstable. At this time GNOME had a clock applet which was present by\ndefault (at least in Ubuntu) that allowed the user to set a home town.\nThis setting was registered in the gconf key\n/apps/panel/applets/clock_screen*/prefs/cities.\nThe idea was to use this information until Geoclue had become more\nstable. To me, it always was a hack. Now that the Clock applet has\ngone (at least in Ubuntu) the \"gnome-clock\" makes little sense and\ncauses a lot of trouble, so I really want to get rid of it as soon as\npossible. The problem is that Geoclue is still problematic for some\npeople.\n\nLastly, there's the support for configuration files for which there's\nno real documentation, but all the options that can be set on the\ncommand line can also be set in the config file.\n"

See the man page for\n  more information.\n- Now looks for the configuration file in `~/.config/redshift/redshift.conf`\n  (or `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/redshift/redshift.conf`) if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is\n  set. The old location at `~/.config/redshift.conf` is deprecated but\n  still searched as a fall back.\n- Run hooks when enabling/disabling Redshift.\n- Default temperatures changed to 6500K during daytime and 4500K during night.\n- With `randr`, allow multiple but not all CRTCs to be redshifted.\n- Removes deprecated original GeoClue location provider (use GeoClue 2\n  instead).\n- The option for enabling the short fade between color effects is now called\n  `fade` instead of `transition` in the configuration file. The term transition\n  caused a lot of confusion about what this option does (the old option still\n  works but is deprecated).\n- The `preserve` option is enabled by default for `vidmode`, `randr`, Windows\n  (`w32gdi`) and macOS (`quartz`). The option is now controlled by the `-P`\n  command line option.\n- Work around issue where Windows adjustments sometimes fail.\n- Install AppArmor profile.\n- quartz: Fix incorrect use of display identifier.\n- Various bug fixes and updated translations.\n\nv1.11 (2016-01-02)\n------------------\n- Add option `preserve` for gamma adjustment methods (`randr`, `vidmode`,\n  `quartz`, `w32gdi`) to apply redness on top of current gamma correction.\n- Fix #158: Add redshift.desktop file to resolve an issue where Geoclue2\n  would not allow redshift to obtain the current location (Laurent Bigonville)\n- Fix #263: Make sure that the child process is terminated when redshift-gtk\n  exits.\n- Fix #284: A sample configuation file has been added to the distribution\n  tarball.\n- Fix warning message in redshift-gtk that is some cases caused redshift-gtk\n  to fail (#271) (Christian Stadelmann, Javier Cantero)\n- Fix #174: Use nanosleep() for sleeping to avoid high CPU load on platforms\n  (NetBSD, ...) with limitations in usleep() (Piotr Meyer)\n- Various updates to man page and translations.\n\n\nv1.10 (2015-01-04)\n------------------\n* Fix #80: Add Geoclue2 location provider.\n* Add CoreLocation (OSX) location provider and Quartz (OSX) gamma\n  adjustment method.\n* Add hooks for user actions on period switch.\n* Be less verbose when color values/period did not change.\n* Add config setting to set gamma separately for day/night.\n* Add support for custom transition start and end elevation (Mattias\n  Andrée).\n* redshift-gtk: Show errors from child process in a dialog.\n* Fix #95: Add AppData file for package managers.\n* Use gettimeofday if POSIX timers not available (add support for\n  OSX).\n* Fix #41: Do not jump to 0 % or 100 % when changing direction of\n  transition (Mattias Andrée).\n* redshift-gtk: Relay USR1 signal to redshift process.\n* redshift-gtk: Notify desktop about startup completion.\n* Fix: systemd unit files were built from the wrong source.\n* Fix #90: Print N/S and E/W in the location (Mattias Andrée).\n* Fix #112: redshift-gtk: Do not buffer lines from child indefinitely.\n* Fix #105: Limit decimals in displayed location to two.\n* Update dependencies listed in HACKING.md (emilf, Kees Hink).\n* Fix: Make desktop file translatable.\n* Add Travis CI build script.\n\nv1.9.1 (2014-04-20)\n-------------------\n* Fix: Do not distribute redshift-gtk, only redshift-gtk.in.\n* Fix: Geoclue support should pull in Glib as dependency.\n* geoclue: Fix segfault when error is NULL (Mattias Andrée).\n* geoclue: Set DISPLAY=:0 to work around issue when outside X\n  (Mattias Andrée).\n* redshift-gtk: Fix crash when toggling state using the status icon.\n* redshift-gtk: Fix line splitting logic (Maks Verver).\n\nv1.9 (2014-04-06)\n-----------------\n* Use improved color scheme provided by Ingo Thies.\n* Add drm driver which will apply adjustments on linux consoles\n  (Mattias Andrée).\n* Remove deprecated GNOME clock location provider.\n* Set proc title for redshift-gtk (Linux/BSD) (Philipp Hagemeister).\n* Show current temperature, location and status in GUI.\n* Add systemd user unit files so that redshift can be used with\n  systemd as a session manager (Henry de Valence).\n* Use checkbox to toggle Redshift in GUI (Mattias Andrée).\n* Gamma correction is applied after brightness and temperature\n  (Mattias Andrée).\n* Use XDG Base Directory Specification when looking for configuration\n  file (Mattias Andrée).\n* Load config from %LOCALAPPDATA%\\redshift.conf on Windows (TingPing).\n* Add RPM spec for Fedora in contrib.\n* redshift-gtk has been ported to Python3 and new PyGObject bindings\n  for Python.\n\nv1.8 (2013-10-21)\n-----------------\n* IMPORTANT: gtk-redshift has changed name to redshift-gtk.\n* Fix crash when starting geoclue provider.

          "content": "Updated color ramp calculation in Redshift 1.9\n==============================================\n\nIngo Thies, 2013\n\n\nThe original version of Redshift uses an RGB table from\n\nhttp://www.vendian.org/mncharity/dir3/blackbody/UnstableURLs/bbr_color.html\n\nwhich contains x,y chromaticities as well as decimal and integer/hex RGB data.\nUnfortunately, the decimal values used for Redshift are not gamma-corrected\nwhile the others are. The gamma correction is part of the sRGB specifications\nand is described in detail at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB. It can roughly\nbe approximated by a power law with an exponent gamma about 2.2. Omitting this\ncorrection results in exaggerated color values. A minor issue concerns the\nstandard whitepoints which are slightly off the Planckian locus. In particular,\nD65 (which corresponds to maximized RGB=1,1,1 in sRGB) contains slightly more\ngreen than 6500 K blackbody color. The developers of Redshift solved this by\nrescaling the RGB values to match 1,1,1 at 6500 K. This, however, leads to\nslightly incorrect colors.\n\nThe corrected color ramp is calculated by the actual Planckian locus below 5000\nkelvins and CIE daylight standard above with an interpolation between these\nlimits. The x,y chromaticities are calculated by using the method described\nin\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_illuminant#Illuminant_series_D\n\nfor daylight and by integrating the CIE 1931 color-matching functions for the\nblackbody spectrum to obtain the Planckian locus. The advantage of using the\nD-type whitepoint is that D65 is already at RGB=1,1,1, so in principle no\nadjustment is required. In practice, minor deviations remain, mainly due to the\nfact that D65 is actually at 6504 K (a consequence of different values for the\nphysical constants being used in the 1960's when D65 was defined) and also due\nto rounding issues. This is fixed by a slight adjustment of RGB which is\nnegligible in practice.\n\nBelow are the RGB, x,y and u,v values of the hybrid color ramp used here.\nPlots of x,y and u,v can be found in xy1931chart.png and uv1960chart.png. The\nPlanckian locus is the smooth curve in the middle of the kelvin tics. The\ncolorramp used in modified Redshift is the one shifting upwards above 5000 K.\nThe official definition of the daylight locus extends down to 4000 K, including\nD55 and D50 standard illuminants. However, to my eyes the color tone looks more\nnatural for color temperatures below 6500 K if switched back to Planckian. For\nthis mere reason the curve shifts to Planckian already between 6500 and and\n5000 K rather than below 5000 K.\n\nNote that the color ramp ends at 25100 K instead of the intended maximum of\n25000 K. This is to avoid an array overflow in the interpolation procedure. In\nthe original Redshift the max. value of 10000 K could never be used for this\nreason.\n\n kelvins    mireds          RGB                                         x,y

This may help your eyes hurt less if you are\nworking in front of the screen at night.\n\nREADME versions: [latest](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/blob/master/README.md) | [1.12](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/blob/v1.12/README.md) | [1.11](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/blob/v1.11/README.md)\n\n![Redshift logo](http://jonls.dk/assets/redshift-icon-256.png)\n\nRun `redshift -h` for help on command line options. You can run the program\nas `redshift-gtk` instead of `redshift` for a graphical status icon.\n\n* Project page: https://github.com/jonls/redshift\n\nBuild status\n------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonls/redshift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonls/redshift)\n[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jonls/redshift?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jonls/redshift)\n\nTechnical Details (Gamma Ramps)\n-------------------------------\n\nRedshift applies a redness effect to the graphical display. The intensity of the redness can be customized and\nscheduled to only be applied at night or to be applied with more intensity at night.\n\nRedshift uses the gamma correction ramps to apply this effect which has traditionally been the only\nway of applying a color effect to the display. Note that this is really a hack to work around the absense of a\nstandardized way of applying color effects, and it is resulting in several issues some of which are explained in\nthe _FAQ_ section below. As long as Redshift is using gamma ramps, many of these issues are impossible to solve properly\nin Redshift.\n\nSince Redshift was first created, many desktop environments have adopted similar functionality as an integrated\ncomponent:\n\n- GNOME: [Night Light](https://www.gnome.org/news/2017/03/gnome-3-24-released/attachment/night-light/)\n- Plasma: Night Color\n- Windows: [Night Light](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027563/windows-10-set-your-display-for-night-time)\n- macOS: Night Shift\n\nUsing the features integrated into the desktop environments avoids many of the issues with gamma ramps which is why\nthese implementations should generally be favored over Redshift. On the other hand, Redshift may offer some additional\nflexibility that is not available in the integrated features.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n### How do I install Redshift?\n\nUse the packages provided by your distribution, e.g. for Ubuntu:\n`apt-get install redshift` or `apt-get install redshift-gtk`. For developers,\nplease see _Building from source_ and _Latest builds from master branch_ below.\n\n### How do I setup a configuration file?\n\nA configuration file is not required but is useful for saving custom\nconfigurations and manually defining the location in case of issues with the\nautomatic location provider. An example configuration can be found in\n[redshift.conf.sample](redshift.conf.sample).\n\nThe configuration file should be saved in the following location depending on\nthe platform:\n\n- Linux/macOS: `~/.config/redshift/redshift.conf` (if the environment variable `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is undefined) or `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/redshift/redshift.conf` (if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is defined).\n- Windows: Put `redshift.conf` in `%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\`\n    (aka `%localappdata%`).\n\n### Where can I find my coordinates to put in the configuration file?\n\nThere are multiple web sites that provide coordinates for map locations, for\nexample clicking anywhere on Google Maps will bring up a box with the\ncoordinates. Remember that longitudes in the western hemisphere (e.g. the\nAmericas) must be provided to Redshift as negative numbers.\n\n### Why does GeoClue fail with access denied error?\n\nIt is possible that the location services have been disabled completely. The\ncheck for this case varies by desktop environment. For example, in GNOME the\nlocation services can be toggled in Settings > Privacy > Location Services.\n\nIf this is not the case, it is possible that Redshift has been improperly\ninstalled or not been given the required permissions to obtain location\nupdates from a system administrator. See\nhttps://github.com/jonls/redshift/issues/318 for further discussion on this\nissue.\n\n### Why doesn't Redshift work on my Chromebook/Raspberry Pi?\n\nCertain video drivers do not support adjustable gamma ramps. In some cases\nRedshift will fail with an error message, but other drivers silently ignore\nadjustments to the gamma ramp.\n\n### Why doesn't Redshift change the backlight when I use the brightness option?\n\nRedshift has a brightness adjustment setting but it does not work the way most\npeople might expect. In fact it is a fake brightness adjustment obtained by\nmanipulating the gamma ramps which means that it does not reduce the backlight\nof the screen. Preferably only use it if your normal backlight adjustment is\ntoo coarse-grained.\n\n### Why doesn't Redshift work on Wayland (e.g. Fedora 25)?\n\nThe Wayland protocol does not support Redshift. There is currently no way for\nRedshift to adjust the color temperature in Wayland.\n\nInstead, you can use:\n\n- In GNOME Shell: Settings → Display Settings → Night Light\n- In Plasma: System Settings → Display and Monitor → Night Color\n\n### Why doesn't Redshift work on Ubuntu with Mir enabled?\n\nMir does not support Redshift.\n\n### When running as a systemd service, redshift fails to connect to the graphical environment\n\nYou need to export your environment variables when your window manager or\ncompositor start up. Typically, you want to run this as part of its startup:\n\n    systemctl --user import-environment; systemctl --user start graphical-session.target\n\nSee your compositor's (or window manager's) documentation for further details\nof setting up the systemd user session.\n\nRelated issues: [#753](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/pull/753).\n\n### The redness effect is applied during the day instead of at night. Why?\n\nThis usually happens to users in America when the longitude has been set in the\nconfiguration file to a positive number. Longitudes in the western hemisphere\nshould be provided as negative numbers (e.g. New York City is at approximately\nlatitude/longitude 41, -74).\n\n### Why does the redness effect occasionally switch off for a few seconds?\n\nRedshift uses the gamma ramps of the graphics driver to apply the redness\neffect but Redshift cannot block other applications from also changing the\ngamma ramps. Some applications (particularly games and video players) will\nreset the gamma ramps. After a few seconds Redshift will kick in again. There\nis no way for Redshift to prevent this from happening.\n\n### Why does the redness effect continuously flicker?\n\nYou may have multiple instances of Redshift running simultaneously. Make sure\nthat only one instance is running for the display where you are seeing the\nflicker.\n\n### Why doesn't Redshift change the color of the mouse cursor?\n\nMouse cursors are usually handled separately by the graphics hardware and is\nnot affected by gamma ramps. Some graphics drivers can be configured to use\nsoftware cursors instead.\n\n### I have an issue with Redshift but it was not mentioned in this FAQ. What do I do?\n\nPlease go to [the issue tracker](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/issues) and\ncheck if your issue has already been reported. If not, please open a new issue\ndescribing you problem.\n\nLatest builds from master branch\n--------------------------------\n\n- [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~dobey/+archive/ubuntu/redshift-daily/+packages) (`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dobey/redshift-daily`)\n- [Windows x86_64](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/jonls/redshift/artifacts/redshift-windows-x86_64.zip?branch=master&job=Environment%3A+arch%3Dx86_64&pr=false)\n- [Windows x86](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/jonls/redshift/artifacts/redshift-windows-i686.zip?branch=master&job=Environment%3A+arch%3Di686&pr=false)\n\nContributing / Building from source\n-----------------------------------\n\nSee the file [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.\n"

This may help your eyes hurt less or reduce the risk for\ndelayed sleep phase syndrome if you are working in front of the screen\nat night.\n.PP\nThe color temperature is set according to the position of the sun. A\ndifferent color temperature is set during night and daytime. During\ntwilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly\nfrom night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly\nadapt over a period of about an hour. At night the color temperature\nshould be set to match the lamps in your room. This is typically a low\ntemperature at around 3000K\\-4000K (default is 4500K). During the day,\nthe color temperature should match the light from outside, typically\naround 5500K\\-6500K (default is 6500K). The light has a higher\ntemperature on an overcast day.\n.PP\nIn addition to the command-line tool \\fBredshift\\fR, the GUI\n\\fBredshift-gtk\\fR provides an alternative interface that shows up as a\nnotification icon in the desktop environment.\n.SH OPTIONS\n.TP\n\\fB\\-h\\fR\nDisplay help message.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-v\\fR\nEnable verbose output.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-V\\fR\nShow program version.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-b\\fR \\fIDAY\\fB:\\fINIGHT\\fR\nScreen brightness to apply (between 0.1 and 1.0).\n.TP\n\\fB\\-c\\fR \\fIFILE\\fR\nLoad settings from specified configuration file.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-g\\fR \\fIR\\fB:\\fIG\\fB:\\fIB\\fR\nAdditional gamma correction to apply.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-l\\fR \\fILAT\\fB:\\fILON\\fR\nYour current location, in degrees, given as floating point numbers,\ntowards north and east, with negative numbers representing south and\nwest, respectively.\n.TP\n\\fB\\-l\\fR \\fIPROVIDER\\fR[\\fB:\\fIOPTIONS\\fR]\nSelect provider for automatic location updates\n(Use \\fB\"\\-l list\"\\fR to see available providers).\n.TP\n\\fB\\-m\\fR \\fIMETHOD\\fR[\\fB:\\fIOPTIONS\\fR]\nMethod to use to set color temperature\n(Use \\fB\"\\-m list\"\\fR to see available methods).\n.TP\n\\fB\\-o\\fR\nOne-shot mode (do not continuously adjust color temperature).
