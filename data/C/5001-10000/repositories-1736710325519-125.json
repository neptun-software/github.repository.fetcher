Validate your version number [here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/which-operating-system).\n- **Visual Studio 2017** with Windows developer tools. Visual Studio 2017 Community is available for free [here](https://dev.windows.com/downloads).\n\n  \n   Ensure the following individual components are selected during installation. Selecting the Universal Windows Platform development workflow should give most of the below \n   \n   **NOTE:** Please also install the **Mobile development with .NET** workflow option (Xamarin Tools) due to a bug in Nugetizer (See [Issue 5026](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5026))\n\n   <details><summary><b>(Click to Expand)</b></summary><p>\n\n  - Visual Studio Core Editor\n  - Nuget Package Manager\n  - C# and Visual Basic Roslyn compilers\n  - Static analysis tools\n  - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.14393.0)\n  - Visual Studio C++ core features\n  - VC++ 2017 v141 toolset (x86, x64)\n  - Visual C++ compilers and libraries for ARM\n  - Visual C++ runtime for UWP\n  - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.10240.0)\n  - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.10586.0)\n  - MSBuild\n  - Windows Universal CRT SDK\n  - Standard Library Modules\n  - VC++ 2015.3 v140 toolset (x86,x64)\n  - Windows Universal C Runtime\n</p></details>\n\nTo get started with an existing Xcode Project, you will also need:\n- **Chocolatey**, a package manager for windows. See how to install the latest version [here](https://chocolatey.org/)\n- **winobjc-tools**, the command line tools for WinObjC. Run the below command from **powershell (Admin)** to get the latest version:\n```\nchoco upgrade winobjc-tools\n```\n(more information about this command and its options can be found [here](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-upgrade). If you want to use develop packages add `--pre` to the command.)\n\n## Getting Started With the Bridge\n### Importing your Xcode Project\nWhen using the bridge, the first thing you'll want to do is generate a Visual Studio solution from your Xcode project:\n\n1. Open Windows PowerShell (type **powershell** in the Start Menu to find it) and navigate to your Xcode project directory using the **cd** command. Note: use the directory containing your .workspace or .xcodeproj folder.\n\n  ```\n    C:\\> cd C:\\MyProject\n  ```\n2. Run the vsimporter tool. This will generate the Visual Studio Solution:\n\n  ```\n    C:\\MyProject> vsimporter.exe\n  ```\n3. Open the generated Visual Studio solution with the command:\n\n  ```\n    C:\\MyProject> MyProject.sln\n  ```\n\nFor more detailed step by step instructions on how to import a project, see the [Quick Start Tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Quick-Start-Tutorial) page of the wiki. For vsimporter options and known issues, check the [Using vsimporter](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Using-vsimporter) wiki page.\n\n### Building & Running the Samples\nA great way to learn more about the bridge and its features is building and running the samples of the SDK, which contain many code examples. We recommend starting with the **WOCCatalog** sample app, which demonstrates an assortment of iOS and XAML UI controls:\n\n1. Clone the repo.\n2. Navigate to the *samples/WOCCatalog* directory of the bridge SDK\n3. Double-click on the **WOCCatalog-WinStore10.sln** solution to open it in Visual Studio\n4. In Visual Studio, right-click on the **WOCCatalog (Universal Windows)** project\n5. Select **Set as StartUp project**\n6. Use **Ctrl-F5** to build and run the app\n\nFor more detailed step by step instructions, see the [Quick Start Tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinObjC/wiki/Quick-Start-Tutorial) page of the wiki.\n\n## Resources & Documentation\nThe following resources will help you get started.

Badros\nGNU Lesser General Public License\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite\n330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute\nverbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the\nsuccessor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version\nnumber 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially\ndesignated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software\nFoundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we\nsuggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary\nGeneral Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,\nbased on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if\nyou wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you\ncan change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\nyou are informed that you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors\nto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\ncopies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link\nother code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\nrecipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes\nto the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,\nand (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no\nwarranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone\nelse and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the\noriginal version, so that the original author's reputation will not be\naffected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free\nprogram. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the\nusers of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent\nholder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of\nthe library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this\nlicense.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\nGeneral Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,\napplies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the\nordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in\norder to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared\nlibrary, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License\ntherefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its\ncriteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax\ncriteria for linking other code with the library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\nto protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It\nalso provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over\ncompeting non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the\nordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser\nlicense provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the\nwidest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto\nstandard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the\nlibrary. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as\nwidely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by\nlimiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General\nPublic License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs\nenables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For\nexample, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many\nmore people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the\nGNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'\nfreedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the\nLibrary has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a\nmodified version of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\nfrom the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in\norder to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program\nwhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General\nPublic License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so\nas to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of\nthose functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has\nbeen distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either\nthe Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with\nmodifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n\"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source\ncode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\nfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\nlibrary.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered\nby this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program\nusing the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered\nonly if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of\nthe use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends\non what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License\nalong with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that\nyou changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all\nthird parties under the terms of this License.\n\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of\ndata to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other\nthan as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a\ngood faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply\nsuch function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever\npart of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose\nthat is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,\nSubsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by\nthis function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the\nsquare root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\nand its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as\nseparate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole\nwhich is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on\nthe terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\nthe Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License\ninstead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must\nalter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the\nordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.\n(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License\nhas appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not\nmake any other change in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so\nthe ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and\nderivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library\ninto a program that is not a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from\nthe same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even\nthough third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the\nobject code.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is\ndesigned to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is\ncalled a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a\nderivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this\nLicense.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an\nexecutable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\nof the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is\ntherefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of\nsuch executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is\npart of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of\nthe Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is\nespecially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if\nthe work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not\nprecisely defined by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts\nand accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less\nin length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of\nwhether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object\ncode plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the\nobject code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables\ncontaining that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked\ndirectly with the Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work\nthat uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions\nof the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided\nthat the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and\nreverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You\nmust supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays\ncopyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among\nthem, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.\nAlso, you must do one of these things:\n\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\ncode for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which\nmust be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an\nexecutable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work\nthat uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user\ncan modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable\ncontaining the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes\nthe contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able\nto recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\nb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A\nsuitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library\nalready present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library\nfunctions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified\nversion of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified\nversion is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\nc) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\ngive the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a\ncharge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\ndesignated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\nmaterials from the same place.\n\ne) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that\nyou have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must\ninclude any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable\nfrom it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need\nnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\nsystem on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of\nother proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating\nsystem. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library\ntogether in an executable that you distribute.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\nside-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\ncovered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\nthe separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\nlibrary facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\nthings:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\nLibrary, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be\ndistributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying\nuncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to\ncopy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\nwho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\nLibrary or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library\n(or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this\nLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing\nor modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and\nconditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\ncompliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\nthat contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\nthe conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\nof this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\nnew problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\nversion\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\nthat version or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may\nchoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author\nto ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make\nexceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of\npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\npromoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nLIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE\nTHE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE\nOR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR\nDATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR\nA FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH\nHOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\nuse to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can\nredistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under\nthese terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public\nLicense).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\nCopyright (C)\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\nthe terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option)\nany later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\nANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more\ndetails.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along\nwith this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59\nTemple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\nnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob'\n(a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990\nTy Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n--------------------------------------\nThird Party Notices for VS Import Tool\n--------------------------------------\nThis Microsoft Open Source project incorporates material from the project(s) listed below (“Third Party Code”).

Grants\n\nEach Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\nnon-exclusive license:\n\n(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or\n    as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer\n    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its\n    Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n\n2.2. Effective Date\n\nThe licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\nbecome effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\ndistributes such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\nthis License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\ndistribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\nLicense (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\npermitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\napplicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\nequivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\nin Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n-------------------\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

It also counts\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\nthe version number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\nand change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially\ndesignated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software\nFoundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we\nsuggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary\nGeneral Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,\nbased on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if\nyou wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you\ncan change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\nyou are informed that you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors\nto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\ncopies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link\nother code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\nrecipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes\nto the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,\nand (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no\nwarranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone\nelse and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the\noriginal version, so that the original author's reputation will not be\naffected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free\nprogram. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the\nusers of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent\nholder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of\nthe library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this\nlicense.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\nGeneral Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,\napplies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the\nordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in\norder to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared\nlibrary, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License\ntherefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its\ncriteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax\ncriteria for linking other code with the library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\nto protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It\nalso provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over\ncompeting non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the\nordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser\nlicense provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the\nwidest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto\nstandard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the\nlibrary. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as\nwidely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by\nlimiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General\nPublic License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs\nenables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For\nexample, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many\nmore people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the\nGNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'\nfreedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the\nLibrary has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a\nmodified version of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\nfrom the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in\norder to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program\nwhich contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General\nPublic License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so\nas to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of\nthose functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has\nbeen distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either\nthe Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\ncontaining the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with\nmodifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n\"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source\ncode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\nfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\nlibrary.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered\nby this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program\nusing the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered\nonly if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of\nthe use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends\non what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License\nalong with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that\nyou changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all\nthird parties under the terms of this License.\n\n  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of\ndata to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other\nthan as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make\na good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not\nsupply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose\nthat is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,\nSubsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by\nthis function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the\nsquare root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\nand its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as\nseparate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole\nwhich is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on\nthe terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\nthe Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License\ninstead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must\nalter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the\nordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.\n(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License\nhas appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not\nmake any other change in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so\nthe ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and\nderivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library\ninto a program that is not a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from\nthe same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even\nthough third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the\nobject code.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is\ndesigned to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is\ncalled a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a\nderivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this\nLicense.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an\nexecutable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\nof the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is\ntherefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of\nsuch executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is\npart of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of\nthe Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is\nespecially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if\nthe work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not\nprecisely defined by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts\nand accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less\nin length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of\nwhether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object\ncode plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the\nobject code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables\ncontaining that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked\ndirectly with the Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work\nthat uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions\nof the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided\nthat the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and\nreverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You\nmust supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays\ncopyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among\nthem, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.\nAlso, you must do one of these things:\n\n  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work\n(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work\nis an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable\n\"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\nuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable\ncontaining the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes\nthe contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be\nable to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\n  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A\nsuitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library\nalready present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library\nfunctions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified\nversion of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified\nversion is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,\nto give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a\ncharge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\ndesignated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\nmaterials from the same place.\n\n  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or\nthat you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must\ninclude any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable\nfrom it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need\nnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\nsystem on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of\nother proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating\nsystem. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library\ntogether in an executable that you distribute.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\nside-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\ncovered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\nthe separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\nlibrary facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\nthings:\n\n  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\nLibrary, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be\ndistributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of\nit is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to\ncopy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\nwho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\nLibrary or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library\n(or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this\nLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing\nor modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and\nconditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\nexercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\ncompliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\nthat contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\nthe conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\nof this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be\nsimilar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address\nnew problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\nversion\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\nthat version or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may\nchoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author\nto ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make\nexceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of\npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\npromoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nLIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE\nTHE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE\nOR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR\nDATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR\nA FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH\nHOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n// Ogg Vorbis audio decoder - v1.07 - public domain\n// http://nothings.org/stb_vorbis/\n//\n// Original version written by Sean Barrett in 2007.\n//\n// Originally sponsored by RAD Game Tools.
