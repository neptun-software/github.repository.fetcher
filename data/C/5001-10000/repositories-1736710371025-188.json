          "content": "# How to contribute\n\nmruby is an open-source project which is looking forward to each contribution.\nContributors agree to license their contribution(s) under MIT license.\n\n## Your Pull Request\n\nTo make it easy to review and understand your change please keep the following\nthings in mind before submitting your pull request:\n\n- Work on the latest possible state of **mruby/master**\n- Create a branch which is dedicated to your change\n- Test your changes before creating a pull request (`rake test`)\n- If possible write a test case which confirms your change\n- Don't mix several features or bug-fixes in one pull request\n- Create a meaningful commit message\n- Explain your change (i.e. with a link to the issue you are fixing)\n- Use mrbgem to provide non ISO features (classes, modules and methods) unless\n  you have a special reason to implement them in the core\n\n## pre-commit\n\nA framework for managing and maintaining multi-language `pre-commit` hooks.\n`pre-commit` can be [installed](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) with `pip`, `curl`, `brew` or `conda`.\n\nYou need to first install `pre-commit` and then install the `pre-commit` hooks with `pre-commit install`.\nNow `pre-commit` will run automatically on git commit!\n\nIt's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all the files when adding new hooks (usually `pre-commit`\nwill only run on the changed files during git hooks). Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to check all files.\n\nTo run a single hook use `pre-commit run --all-files <hook_id>`\n\nTo update use `pre-commit autoupdate`\n\nSometimes you might need to skip one or more hooks which can be done with the `SKIP` environment variable.\n\n`$ SKIP=yamllint git commit -m \"foo\"`\n\nFor convenience, we have added `pre-commit run --all-files`, `pre-commit install` and `pre-commit autoupdate`\nto both the Makefile and the Rakefile. Run them with:\n\n- `make check` or `rake check`\n- `make checkinstall` or `rake checkinstall`\n- `make checkupdate` or `rake checkupdate`\n\nTo configure `pre-commit` you can modify the config file [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml).\nWe use [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/lint.yml) to run `pre-commit` on every pull request.\n\n### pre-commit quick links\n\n- [Quick start](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start)\n- [Usage](https://pre-commit.com/#usage)\n- [pre-commit autoupdate](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-autoupdate)\n- [Temporarily disabling hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks)\n\n## Docker\n\nWe have both a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the repository root.\nYou can run these with the command line or use\n[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).\n\nThe Docker image is running Debian bullseye with Ruby and Python installed.\nYou can build the Docker image with:\n\n`$ docker-compose build test`\n\nSo far we just have one service: `test`. Running the default `docker-compose`\ncommand will create the Docker image, spin up a container and then build and\nrun all mruby tests.\n\nThe default `docker-compose` command is:\n\n`$ docker-compose -p mruby run test`\n\nYou can also use Make or Rake to run the default `docker-compose`\ncommand from above:\n\n- `make composetest`\n- `rake composetest`\n\nList your Docker images with:\n\n```console\n$ docker images\nREPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE\nmruby-test   latest    ec60f9536948   29 seconds ago   1.29GB\n```\n\nYou can also run any custom `docker-compose` command which will override\nthe default. For example to run `pre-commit run --all-files` type:\n\n`$ docker-compose -p mruby run test pre-commit run --all-files`\n\nFor convenience, you can also run `pre-commit` with:\n\n- `make composecheck`\n- `rake composecheck`\n\nThe bonus of running `pre-commit` with `docker-compose` is that you won't need\nto install `pre-commit` and the hooks on your local machine. And that also\nmeans you won't need to install `brew`, `conda` or `pip`.\n\nNote limitation: currently running `pre-commit` with `docker-compose` we\nskip the `check-executables-have-shebangs` hook.\n\nTwo more examples of custom `docker-compose` commands are:\n\n- `$ docker-compose -p mruby run test ls`\n- `$ docker-compose -p mruby run test rake doc:api`\n\nIf you want to test using a different `docker-compose` YAML config file you\ncan use the `-f` flag:\n\n`$ docker-compose -p mruby -f docker-compose.test.yml run test`\n\n- <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>\n- <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/>\n\n## Spell Checking\n\nWe are using `pre-commit` to run [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell)\nto check code for common misspellings. We have a small custom dictionary file [codespell.txt](.github/linters/codespell.txt).\n\n## Coding conventions\n\nHow to style your C and Ruby code which you want to submit.\n\n### C code\n\nThe core part (parser, bytecode-interpreter, core-lib, etc.) of mruby is\nwritten in the C programming language. Please note the following hints for your\nC code:\n\n#### Comply with C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999)\n\nmruby should be highly portable to other systems and compilers. For this it is\nrecommended to keep your code as close as possible to the C99 standard\n(<http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf>).\n\nVisual C++ is also an important target for mruby (supported version is 2013 or\nlater). For this reason features that are not supported by Visual C++ may not\nbe used (e.g. `%z` of `strftime()`).\n\nNOTE: Old GCC requires `-std=gnu99` option to enable C99 support.\n\n#### Reduce library dependencies to a minimum\n\nThe dependencies to libraries should be kept to an absolute minimum. This\nincreases the portability but makes it also easier to cut away parts of mruby\non-demand.\n\n#### Insert a break after the function return value:\n\n```c\nint\nmain(void)\n{\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### Ruby code\n\nParts of the standard library of mruby are written in the Ruby programming\nlanguage itself. Please note the following hints for your Ruby code:\n\n#### Comply with the Ruby standard (ISO/IEC 30170:2012)\n\nmruby is currently targeting to execute Ruby code which complies to ISO/IEC\n30170:2012 (<https://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579>),\nunless there's a clear reason, e.g. the latest Ruby has changed behavior from ISO.\n\n## Building documentation\n\n### mruby API\n\n- [YARD](https://yardoc.org/) - YARD is a documentation generation tool for the Ruby programming language\n- [yard-mruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/yard-mruby) - Document mruby sources with YARD\n- [yard-coderay](https://rubygems.org/gems/yard-coderay) - Adds coderay syntax highlighting to YARD docs\n\n### C API\n\n- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) - Generate documentation from source code\n- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) - Graphviz is open source graph visualization software\n"

`mruby/build/host/bin/`).\n- Encode and decode escape characters for presym ([#6011](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/6011))\n- Rakefile: remove default build target directories in `deep_clean` ([#6032](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/6032), [1e38569](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/1e38569))\n\n# Other breaking changes\n\n- `mrb_f_raise()` is now an internal function\n  ([#5923](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/5923), [#6070](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/6070))\n- `mrb_make_exception()` is now an internal function with different parameters\n  ([431f83e](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/431f83e), [78137f3](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/78137f3))\n- The `File#path` method no longer uses the `#to_path` method for implicit conversion\n  ([d86c4a7](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/d86c4a7))\n- stop mrb isolation for each test file ([a20fbe5](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/commit/a20fbe5))\n- RBreak remembers the CI location ([#6103](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/pull/6103))\n\n# Bugs Fixed\n\n- [#5724](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues/5724) Rational#\\*\\* is missing\n-

The \"mruby\" interpreter\nprogram and the interactive \"mirb\" shell are provided as examples. You can also\ncompile Ruby programs into compiled byte code using the \"mrbc\" compiler. All\nthese tools are located in the \"bin\" directory. \"mrbc\" can also generate\ncompiled byte code in a C source file. See the \"mrbtest\" program under the\n\"test\" directory for an example.\n\nThis achievement was sponsored by the Regional Innovation Creation R&D Programs\nof the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.\n\n## How to get mruby\n\nTo get mruby, you can download the stable version 3.3.0 from the official mruby\nGitHub repository or clone the trunk of the mruby source tree with the \"git\nclone\" command. You can also install and compile mruby using [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install), [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) or [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm).\n\nThe latest development version of mruby can be downloaded via the following URL: [https://github.com/mruby/mruby/zipball/master](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/zipball/master)\n\nThe trunk of the mruby source tree can be checked out with the\nfollowing command:\n\n```console\n$ git clone https://github.com/mruby/mruby.git\n```\n\n## mruby homepage\n\nThe URL of the mruby homepage is: <https://mruby.org>.\n\n## Mailing list\n\nWe don't have a mailing list, but you can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues).\n\n## How to compile, test, and install (mruby and gems)\n\nFor the simplest case, type\n\n```console\nrake all test\n```\n\nSee the [compile.md](doc/guides/compile.md) file for the detail.\n\n## Building documentation\n\nThere are two sets of documentation in mruby: the mruby API (generated by YARD) and C API (Doxygen and Graphviz)\n\nTo build both of them, simply go\n\n```console\nrake doc\n```\n\nYou can also view them in your browser\n\n```console\nrake view_api\nrake view_capi\n```\n\n## How to customize mruby (mrbgems)\n\nmruby contains a package manager called \"mrbgems\" that you can use to create\nextensions in C and/or Ruby. For a guide on how to use mrbgems, consult the\n[mrbgems.md](doc/guides/mrbgems.md) file, and for example code, refer to the\n[examples/mrbgems/](examples/mrbgems) folder.\n\n## Index of Document\n\n<!--\n    This section is generated by `rake doc:update-index`.\n    All manual changes will get lost.\n-->\n\n<!-- BEGIN OF MRUBY DOCUMENT INDEX -->\n\n- [About the Limitations of mruby](doc/limitations.md)\n- [About the Compile](doc/guides/compile.md)\n- [About the Debugger with the `mrdb` Command](doc/guides/debugger.md)\n- [About GC Arena](doc/guides/gc-arena-howto.md)\n- [About the mruby directory structure](doc/guides/hier.md)\n- [About Linking with `libmruby`](doc/guides/link.md)\n- [About Memory Allocator Customization](doc/guides/memory.md)\n- [About Build-time Configurations](doc/guides/mrbconf.md)\n- [About the Build-time Library Manager](doc/guides/mrbgems.md)\n- [About the Symbols](doc/guides/symbol.md)\n- [Internal Implementation / About Value Boxing](doc/internal/boxing.md)\n- [Internal Implementation / About mruby Virtual Machine Instructions](doc/internal/opcode.md)\n\n<!-- END OF MRUBY DOCUMENT INDEX -->\n\n## License\n\nmruby is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Note for License\n\nmruby has chosen a MIT License due to its permissive license allowing\ndevelopers to target various environments such as embedded systems.\nHowever, the license requires the display of the copyright notice and license\ninformation in manuals for instance.
