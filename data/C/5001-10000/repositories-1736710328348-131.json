          "content": "# Nokogiri Changelog\n\nNokogiri follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), please see the [README.md](README.md) for details.\n\n---\n\n## next / unreleased\n\n### Improved\n\n* [CRuby] The HTML5 parser now has linear performance when parsing many attributes. Previously performance was quadratic due to two hotspots, one in detecting duplicate attributes and one in constructing the libxml2 data structures. (#3393) @flavorjones\n\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Update to rake-compiler-dock v1.8.0 for building precompiled native gems. (#3404) @flavorjones\n\n\n## v1.18.1 / 2024-12-29\n\n### Fixed\n\n* [CRuby] XML::SAX::ParserContext keeps a reference to the input to avoid a potential use-after-free issue that's existed since v1.4.0 (2009). (#3395) @flavorjones\n\n\n## v1.18.0 / 2024-12-25\n\n### Notable Changes\n\n#### Ruby\n\nThis release introduces native gem support for Ruby 3.4.\n\nThis release ends support for Ruby 3.0, for which [upstream support ended 2024-04-23](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/).\n\nThis release ships separate precompiled GNU and Musl gems for all linux platforms. Previously both GNU and Musl target systems could use and install the same gem, e.g., the platform gem for `x86_64-linux`. Now, however, the precompiled gem platforms would be `x86_64-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-linux-musl`. So long as you're on `bundler >= 2.5.6` this should be seamless other than perhaps needing to update the platforms in your \"Gemfile.lock\".\n\nThis release drops precompiled native platform gems for `x86-linux` and `x86-mingw32`. **These platforms are still supported.** Users on these platforms must install the \"ruby platform\" gem which requires a compiler toolchain. See [Installing the `ruby` platform gem](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html#installing-the-ruby-platform-gem) in the installation docs. (#3369, #3081)\n\n\n### Improved\n\n* [CRuby] CSS and XPath queries are faster now that `Node#xpath`, `Node#css`, and related functions are using a faster XPathContext initialization process. We benchmarked a 1.9x improvement for a 6kb file. Big thanks to @nwellnhof for helping with this one. (#3378, superseded by #3389) @flavorjones\n\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Update to rake-compiler-dock v1.7.0 for building precompiled native gems. (#3375, #3392) @flavorjones\n\n\n## v1.17.2 / 2024-12-12\n\n### Fixed\n\n* [JRuby] Fixed an issue where `Node#dup` when called with the `new_parent_doc` parameter was not decorating the node with the document's `Node` decorators. [#3372] @flavorjones\n\n\n## v1.17.1 / 2024-12-10\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed a potential segfault when using `Node#dup` and `DocumentFragment#dup`. [#3359] @byroot @flavorjones\n* `Node#dup` and `Node#clone` now correctly decorate the new node with the document's `Node` decorators. [#3363] @flavorjones\n\n\n## v1.17.0 / 2024-12-08\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to [v2.13.5](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.13.5). @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxslt is updated to [v1.1.42](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/-/releases/v1.1.42). @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] Minimum supported version of libxml2 raised to v2.9.2 (released 2014-10-16) from v2.6.21. [#3232, #3287] @flavorjones\n* [JRuby] Minimum supported version of Java raised to 8 (released 2014-03-18) from 7. [#3134] @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] Update to rake-compiler-dock v1.5.1 for building precompiled native gems. [#3216] @flavorjones\n\n\n### Notable changes\n\n#### SAX Parsers\n\nThe XML and HTML4 SAX parsers have received a lot of attention in this release, and we've fixed multiple long-standing bugs with encoding and entity handling. In addition, libxml2 v2.13 has also made some underlying fixes and improvements to encoding and entity handling.\n\nWe're shipping these fixes in a minor release because we firmly believe the resulting behavior is correct and standards-compliant, however applications that have been depending on the buggy behavior may be impacted.\n\nIf your application relies on the SAX parsers, and in particular if you're SAX-parsing documents with parsed entities or incorrect encoding declarations, please read the changelog below carefully.\n\n\n#### Fragment parsing\n\nDocument fragment parsing has been improved, particularly with respect to handling malformed fragments or fragments with implicit namespace prefixes. Namespace reconciliation still isn't where we want it to be, but it's an improvement.\n\nHTML5 fragment parsing now allows the context node to be specified as a `context:` keyword argument to the `HTML5::DocumentFragment.parse` and `.new` methods, which should allow for more flexible sanitization and future support for the [draft HTML Sanitizer API](https://wicg.github.io/sanitizer-api/) in downstream libraries.\n\n\n#### Error handling\n\nIn scenarios where multiple errors could be reported by the underlying parser, the errors will be aggregated into a single `Nokogiri::XML::SyntaxError` that is raised. Previously only the final error reported by libxml2 was raised (which was often misleading if it was only a warning and not the fatal error).\n\n\n#### Schema validation\n\nWe've resolved many long-standing bugs in the various schema classes, validation methods, and their error reporting. Behavior is now consistent across schema types and input types, as well as parser backends (Xerces and libxml2).\n\n\n#### Keyword arguments\n\nThe following methods now accept keyword arguments in addition to positional arguments, and use `...` parameter forwarding when possible:\n`HTML4()`, `HTML4.fragment`, `HTML4.parse`, `HTML4::Document.parse`, `HTML4::DocumentFragment#initialize`, `HTML4::DocumentFragment.parse`, `HTML5()`, `HTML5.fragment`, `HTML5.parse`, `HTML5::Document.parse`, `HTML5::Document.read_io`, `HTML5::Document.read_memory`, `HTML5::DocumentFragment#initialize`, `HTML5::DocumentFragment.parse`, `XML()`, `XML.fragment`, `XML.parse`, `XML::Document.parse`, `XML::DocumentFragment#initialize`, `XML::DocumentFragment.parse`, `XML::Node#canonicalize`, `XML::Node.parse`, `XML::Reader()`, `XML::RelaxNG()`, `XML::RelaxNG.new`, `XML::RelaxNG.read_memory`, `XML::SAX::PushParser#initialize`, `XML::Schema()`, `XML::Schema.new`, `XML::Schema.read_memory`, and `XSLT()`.\n\nSpecial thanks to those contributors who participated in the RubyConf 2024 Hack Day to work on #3323 to help modernize Nokogiri by adding keyword arguments and using parameter forwarding in many methods, and expanding some of the documentation! We intend to continue adding keyword argument support to more methods. #3323 #3324 #3326 #3327 #3329 #3330 #3332 #3333 #3334 #3335 #3336 #3342 #3355 #3356 @infews @matiasow @MattJones @mononoken @openbl @flavorjones\n\n\n### Added\n\n* Introduce support for a new SAX callback `XML::SAX::Document#reference`, which is called to report some parsed XML entities when `XML::SAX::ParserContext#replace_entities` is set to the default value `false`. This is necessary functionality for some applications that were previously relying on incorrect entity error reporting which has been fixed (see below). For more information, read the docs for `Nokogiri::XML::SAX::Document`. [#1926] @flavorjones\n* `XML::SAX::Parser#parse_memory` and `#parse_file` now accept an optional `encoding` argument. When not provided, the parser will fall back to the encoding passed to the initializer, and then fall back to autodetection. [#3288] @flavorjones\n* `XML::SAX::ParserContext.memory` now accepts an optional `encoding` argument. When not provided, the encoding will be autodetected. [#3288] @flavorjones\n* New readonly attributes `XML::DocumentFragment#parse_options` and `HTML4::DocumentFragment#parse_options` return the options used to parse the document fragment. @flavorjones\n* New method `XML::Reader.new` is the primary constructor to which `XML::Reader()` forwards. Both methods now take `url:`, `encoding:`, and `options:` kwargs in addition to  the previous calling convention of passing positional parameters. #3326 @infews @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] The HTML5 parse methods accept a `:parse_noscript_content_as_text` keyword argument which will emulate the parsing behavior of a browser which has scripting enabled. [#3178, #3231] @stevecheckoway\n* [CRuby] `HTML5::DocumentFragment.parse` and `.new` accept a `:context` keyword argument that is the parse context node or element name. Previously this could only be passed in as a positional argument to `.new` and not at all to `.parse`. @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] `Nokogiri::HTML5::Builder` is similar to `HTML4::Builder` but returns an `HTML5::Document`. [#3119] @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] Attributes in an HTML5 document can be serialized individually, something that has always been supported by the HTML4 serializer. [#3125, #3127] @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] Introduce a compile-time option, `--disable-xml2-legacy`, to remove from libxml2 its dependencies on `zlib` and `liblzma` and disable implicit `HTTP` network requests. These all remain enabled by default, and are present in the precompiled native gems. This option is a precursor for removing these libraries in a future major release, but may be interesting for the security-minded who do not need features like automatic decompression and would like to remove these dependencies. You can read more and give feedback on these plans in #3168. [#3247] @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] If errors are returned from schema validation, a new attribute `SyntaxError#path` will contain the XPath path of the node that caused the validation failure. [#3316] @ryanong\n\n\n### Improved\n\n* Documentation has been improved for `XML::RelaxNG`, `XML::Schema`, `XML::Reader`, `HTML5`, `HTML5::Document`, `HTML5::DocumentFragment`, `HTML4::Document`, `HTML4::DocumentFragment`, `XML`, `XML::Document`, `XML::DocumentFragment`. #3355 @flavorjones\n* Documentation has been improved for `CSS.xpath_for`. [#3224] @flavorjones\n* Documentation for the SAX parsing classes has been greatly improved, including encoding overrides and the complex entity-handling behavior. [#3265] @flavorjones\n* `XML::Schema#read_memory` and `XML::RelaxNG#read_memory` are now Ruby methods that call `#from_document`. Previously these were native functions, but they were buggy on both CRuby and JRuby (but worse on JRuby) and so this is now useful, comparable in performance, and simpler code that is easier to maintain. [#2113, #2115] @flavorjones\n* `XML::SAX::ParserContext.io`'s `encoding` argument is now optional, and can now be an `Encoding` or an encoding name. When not provided will default to autodetecting the encoding. [#3288] @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] The update to libxml v2.13 improves \"in context\" fragment parsing recovery. We removed our hacky workaround for recovery that led to silently-degraded functionality when parsing fragments with parse errors. Specifically, malformed XML fragments that used implicit namespace prefixes will now \"link up\" to the namespaces in the parent document or node, where previously they did not. [#2092] @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] When multiple errors could be detected by the parser and there's no obvious document to save them in (for example, when parsing a document with the recovery parse option turned off), the libxml2 errors are aggregated into a single `Nokogiri::XML::SyntaxError`. Previously, only the last error recorded by libxml2 was raised, which might be misleading if it's merely a warning and not the fatal error preventing the operation. [#2562] @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] The SAX parser context and handler implementation has been simplified and now takes advantage of some of libxml2's default SAX handlers for entities and DTD management. [#3265] @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] When compiling packaged libraries from source, allow users' `AR` and `LD` environment variables to set the archiver and linker commands, respectively. This augments the existing `CC` environment variable to set the compiler command. [#3165] @ziggythehamster\n* [CRuby] When building from source on MacOS, environment variables `AR` and `RANLIB` are now respected when set instead of being overridden to /usr/bin/{ar,ranlib} (which is still the default). [#3338] @joshheinrichs-shopify\n\n\n### Fixed\n\n* `Node#clone`, `NodeSet#clone`, and `*::Document#clone` all properly copy the metaclass of the original as expected. Previously, `#clone` had been aliased to `#dup` for these classes (since v1.3.0 in 2009). [#316, #3117] @flavorjones\n* CSS queries for pseudo-selectors that cannot be translated into XPath expressions now raise a more descriptive `Nokogiri::CSS::SyntaxError` when they are parsed. Previously, an invalid XPath expression was evaluated and a hard-to-understand XPath error was raised by the query engine. [#3193] @flavorjones\n* `Schema#validate` returns errors on empty and malformed files. Previously, it would return errors on empty/malformed Documents, but not when reading from files. [#642] @flavorjones\n* `XML::Builder` is now consistent with how it sets block scope. Previously, missing methods with blocks on dynamically-created nodes were always handled by invoking `instance_eval(&block)` on the Builder, even when the Builder was yielding self for all other missing methods with blocks. [#1041] @flavorjones\n* `HTML4::DocumentFragment.parse` accepts `IO` input. Previously, it required a string and would raise a `TypeError` when passed an `IO`. [#2069] @sharvy\n* [CRuby] libgumbo (the HTML5 parser) treats reaching max-depth as EOF. This addresses a class of issues when the parser is interrupted in this way. [#3121] @stevecheckoway\n* [CRuby] Update node GC lifecycle to avoid a potential memory leak with fragments in libxml 2.13.0 caused by changes in `xmlAddChild`. [#3156] @flavorjones\n* [CRuby] libgumbo correctly prints nonstandard element names in error messages. [#3219] @stevecheckoway\n* [CRuby] External entity references no long cause the SAX parser to register errors. [#1926] @flavorjones\n* [JRuby] Fixed entity reference serialization, which rendered both the reference and the replacement text. Incredibly nobody noticed this bug for over a decade. [#3272] @flavorjones\n* [JRuby] Fixed some bugs in how `Node#attributes` handles attributes with namespaces. [#2677, #2679] @flavorjones\n* [JRuby] Fix `Schema#validate` to only return the most recent Document's errors. Previously, if multiple documents were validated, this method returned the accumulated errors of all previous documents. [#1282] @flavorjones\n* [JRuby] Fix `Schema#validate` to not clobber the `@errors` instance variable. [#1282] @flavorjones\n* [JRuby] Empty documents fail schema validation as they should. [#783] @flavorjones\n* [JRuby] SAX parsing now respects the `#replace_entities` attribute, which defaults to `false`. Previously this flag defaulted to `true` and was completely ignored. [#614] @flavorjones\n* [JRuby] The SAX callback `Document#start_element_namespace` received a blank string for the URI when a namespace was not present. It now receives `nil` (as does the CRuby impl). [#3265] @flavorjones\n* [JRuby] `Reader#outer_xml` and `#inner_xml` encode entities properly. [#1523] @flavorjones\n\n\n### Changed\n\n* [CRuby] `Nokogiri::XML::CData.new` no longer accepts `nil` as the content argument, making `CData` behave like other character data classes (like `Comment` and `Text`). This change was necessitated by behavioral changes in libxml2 v2.13.0. If you wish to create an empty CDATA node, pass an empty string. [#3156] @flavorjones\n* Internals:\n    * The internal `CSS::XPathVisitor` class now accepts the xpath prefix and the context namespaces as constructor arguments. The `prefix:` and `ns:` keyword arguments to `CSS.xpath_for` cannot be specified if the `visitor:` keyword argument is also used. `CSS::XPathVisitor` now exposes `#builtins`, `#doctype`, `#prefix`, and `#namespaces` attributes. [#3225] @flavorjones\n    * The internal CSS selector cache has been extracted into a distinct class, `CSS::SelectorCache`. Previously it was part of the `CSS::Parser` class. [#3226] @flavorjones\n    * The internal `Gumbo.parse` and `Gumbo.fragment` methods now take keyword arguments instead of positional arguments. [#3199] @flavorjones\n\n\n### Deprecated\n\n* The undocumented and unused method `Nokogiri::CSS.parse` is now deprecated and will generate a warning. The AST returned by this method is private and subject to change and removal in future versions of Nokogiri. This method will be removed in a future version of Nokogiri.\n* Passing an options hash to `CSS.xpath_for` is now deprecated and will generate a warning. Use keyword arguments instead. This will become an error in a future version of Nokogiri.\n* Passing libxml2 encoding IDs to `SAX::ParserContext` methods is now deprecated and will generate a warning. The use of `SAX::Parser::ENCODINGS` is also deprecated. Use `Encoding` objects or encoding names instead.\n\n\n### Thank you!\n\nThe following people and organizations were kind enough to sponsor @flavorjones or the Nokogiri project during the development of v1.17.0:\n\n* via Github sponsors\n    * renuo @renuo\n    * Ajaya Agrawalla @ajaya\n    * Rob Stringer @Mycobee\n    * Better Stack Community @betterstack-community\n    * Prowly @prowlycom\n    * Maxime Gauthier @biximilien\n    * Harry Lascelles @hlascelles\n    * Evil Martians @evilmartians\n    * Typesense @typesense\n    * YOSHIDA Katsuhiko @kyoshidajp\n    * Quan Nguyen @qu8n\n    * Sentry @getsentry\n    * Codecov @codecov\n    * Frank Groeneveld @frenkel\n    * Hiroshi SHIBATA @hsbt\n    * Nando Vieira @fnando\n    * Orien Madgwick @orien\n    * Avo @avo-hq\n    * Zoran Pesic @zokioki\n    * @zzak\n    * Graham Watts @GingerGraham\n    * Nandang Permana Kusuma @nandangpk\n    * Mr. Henry @mrhenry\n    * Götz Görisch @GoetzGoerisch\n    * Andrew Nesbitt @andrew\n* via Thanks.dev\n    * Sentry @getsentry\n    * Codecov @codecov\n    * Keygen @keygen-sh\n    * Keith Bauson @kwbauson\n    * Nicco Kunzmann @niccokunzmann\n    * timhaynes @timhaynes\n* via Open Collective\n    * Airbnb @airbnb\n    * Nemo @captn3m0\n    * Velocity Labs @velocity-labs\n\nWe'd also like to thank @github who donate a ton of compute time for our CI pipelines!\n\n\n## v1.16.8 / 2024-12-02\n\n### Fixed\n\n* [CRuby] When serializing HTML5 documents, properly escape foreign content \"style\" elements. Normally, a \"style\" tag contains  raw text that does not need entity-escaping, but when it appears in either SVG or MathML foreign content, the \"style\" tag is now correctly escaped when serialized. @flavorjones\n\n\n## v1.16.7 / 2024-07-27\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to [v2.12.9](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.9), which the upstream release notes state is a security release to address CVE-2024-40896. Nokogiri's maintainers believe this vulnerability does not affect users of Nokogiri, but we advise upgrading at your earliest convenience anyway.\n\n\n## v1.16.6 / 2024-06-13\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to [v2.12.8](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.8), which the release notes state is a bugfix release.\n\n\n## v1.16.5\n\n### Security\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to address CVE-2024-34459. See [GHSA-r95h-9x8f-r3f7](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-r95h-9x8f-r3f7) for more information.\n\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to [v2.12.7](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.7) from v2.12.6. (@flavorjones)\n\n\n## v1.16.4 / 2024-04-10\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored zlib in the precompiled native gems is updated to [v1.3.1](https://zlib.net/ChangeLog.txt) from v1.3. Nokogiri is not affected by the minizip CVE patched in this version, but this update may satisfy some security scanners. Related, see [this discussion](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/discussions/3168) about removing the compression libraries altogether in a future version of Nokogiri.\n\n\n## v1.16.3 / 2024-03-15\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to [v2.12.6](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.6) from v2.12.5. (@flavorjones)\n\n\n### Changed\n\n* [CRuby] `XML::Reader` sets the `@encoding` instance variable during reading if it is not passed into the initializer. Previously, it would remain `nil`. The behavior of `Reader#encoding` has not changed. This works around changes to how libxml2 reports the encoding used in v2.12.6.\n\n\n## v1.16.2 / 2024-02-04\n\n### Security\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to address CVE-2024-25062. See [GHSA-xc9x-jj77-9p9j](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-xc9x-jj77-9p9j) for more information.\n\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to [v2.12.5](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.5) from v2.12.4. (@flavorjones)\n\n\n## v1.16.1 / 2024-02-03\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to [v2.12.4](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.4) from v2.12.3. (@flavorjones)\n\n\n### Fixed\n\n* [CRuby] `XML::Reader` defaults the encoding to UTF-8 if it's not specified in either the document or as a method parameter. Previously non-ASCII characters were serialized as NCRs in this case. [#2891] (@flavorjones)\n* [CRuby] Restored support for compilation by GCC versions earlier than 4.6, which was broken in v1.15.0 (540e9aee). [#3090] (@adfoster-r7)\n* [CRuby] Patched upstream libxml2 to allow parsing HTML5 in the context of a namespaced node (e.g., foreign content like MathML). [#3112, #3116] (@flavorjones)\n* [CRuby] Fixed a small memory leak in libgumbo (HTML5 parser) when the maximum tree depth limit is hit. [#3098, #3100] (@stevecheckoway)\n\n\n## v1.16.0 / 2023-12-27\n\n### Notable Changes\n\n#### Ruby\n\nThis release introduces native gem support for Ruby 3.3.\n\nThis release ends support for Ruby 2.7, for which [upstream support ended 2023-03-31](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/).\n\n\n#### Pattern matching\n\nThis version marks _official support_ for the pattern matching API in `XML::Attr`, `XML::Document`, `XML::DocumentFragment`, `XML::Namespace`, `XML::Node`, and `XML::NodeSet` (and their subclasses), originally introduced as an experimental feature in v1.14.0. (@flavorjones)\n\nDocumentation on what can be matched:\n\n* [`XML::Attr#deconstruct_keys`](https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Attr.html?h=deconstruct#method-i-deconstruct_keys)\n* [`XML::Document#deconstruct_keys`](https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Document.html?h=deconstruct#method-i-deconstruct_keys)\n* [`XML::Namespace#deconstruct_keys`](https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Namespace.html?h=deconstruct+namespace#method-i-deconstruct_keys)\n* [`XML::Node#deconstruct_keys`](https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Node.html?h=deconstruct#method-i-deconstruct_keys)\n* [`XML::DocumentFragment#deconstruct`](https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/DocumentFragment.html?h=deconstruct#method-i-deconstruct)\n* [`XML::NodeSet#deconstruct`](https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/NodeSet.html?h=deconstruct#method-i-deconstruct)\n\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated to v2.12.3 from v2.11.6. (@flavorjones)\n    * https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.0\n    * https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.1\n    * https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.2\n    * https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.12.3\n\n\n### Fixed\n\n* CSS `nth` pseudo-classes now handle spaces, e.g. `\"2n + 1\"`. [#3018] (@fusion2004)\n* [CRuby] `libgumbo` no longer leaks memory when an incomplete tag is abandoned by the HTML5 parser. [#3036] (@flavorjones)\n\n\n### Removed\n\n* Removed `Nokogiri::HTML5.get` which was deprecated in v1.12.0. [#2278] (@flavorjones)\n* Removed the CSS-to-XPath utility modules `XPathVisitorAlwaysUseBuiltins` and `XPathVisitorOptimallyUseBuiltins`, which were deprecated in v1.13.0 in favor of `XPathVisitor` constructor args. [#2403] (@flavorjones)\n* Removed `XML::Reader#attribute_nodes` which was deprecated in v1.13.8 in favor of `#attribute_hash`. [#2598, #2599] (@flavorjones)\n* [CRuby] Removed the `libxml/libxml2_path` key from `VersionInfo`, used in the past for third-party library integration, in favor of the `nokogiri/cppflags` and `nokogiri/ldflags` keys. Please note that third-party library integration is not fully supported and may be deprecated soon, see #2746 for more context.

I'm super excited that you're interested in contributing to Nokogiri. Welcome!\n\nThis document is intended only to provide a brief introduction on how to contribute to Nokogiri. It's not a complete specification of everything you need to know, so if you want to know more, I encourage you to reach out to the maintainers via email, twitter, or a new Github issue. We'd love to get to know you a bit better!\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nOur full Code of Conduct is in [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nFor best results, be kind. Remember that Nokogiri maintainers are volunteers, and treat them with respect. Do not act entitled to service. Do not be rude. Do not use judgmental or foul language.\n\n\n## Some guiding principles of the project\n\nThe top guiding principles, as noted in the README are:\n\n- be secure-by-default by treating all documents as **untrusted** by default\n- be a **thin-as-reasonable layer** on top of the underlying parsers, and don't attempt to fix behavioral differences between the parsers\n\n\nNokogiri supports both CRuby and JRuby, and has native code specific to each (though much Ruby code is shared between them). Some related secondary principles are:\n\n- Whenever possible, implement the same functionality for both CRuby and JRuby.\n- Whenever possible, implement shared behavior as shared Ruby code (i.e., write as little native code as reasonable).\n- Whenever possible, avoid writing tests that are platform-specific (but if you do, use `skip` to provide an explanation).\n\nNotably, despite all parsers being standards-compliant, there are behavioral inconsistencies between the parsers used in the CRuby and JRuby implementations, and Nokogiri does not and should not attempt to remove these inconsistencies. Instead, we surface these differences in the test suite when they are important/semantic; or we intentionally write tests to depend only on the important/semantic bits (omitting whitespace from regex matchers on results, for example).\n\nNokogiri is widely used in the Ruby ecosystem, and so extra care should be taken to avoid introducing breaking changes. Please read our [Semantic Versioning Policy](https://nokogiri.org/index.html#semantic-versioning-policy) to understand what we consider to be a breaking change.\n\n\n## Where to start getting involved\n\nPlease take a look at our [Issues marked \"Help Wanted\"](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).\n\nAlso, [pull requests for documentation improvements are always welcome](#documentation)!\n\n\n## Submitting Pull Requests\n\nPull requests should be made with `main` as the merge base. See the next section for details.\n\n**Pull requests that introduce behavior change must always contain a test** demonstrating the behavior being introduced, fixed, or changed. These tests should ideally communicate to the maintainers the problem being solved. We will ask you for clarification if we don't understand the problem you're trying to solve.\n\nIf the pull request contains a feature or a bugfix, please make sure to create a CHANGELOG entry in the \"unreleased\" section.\n\nPlease do not submit pull requests that make purely cosmetic changes to the code (style, naming, etc.). While we recognize that the code can always be improved, we prefer that you focus on more impactful contributions.\n\nFeel free to push a \"work in progress\" to take advantage of the feedback loops from CI. But then please indicate that it's still in progress by marking it as a [Draft Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests).\n\n\n## Branch Management and Release Management\n\nNokogiri follows SemVer, and some nuances of that policy are spelled out in [Semantic Versioning Policy](https://nokogiri.org/index.html#semantic-versioning-policy).\n\nDevelopment should be happening on `main`, which sets `Nokogiri::VERSION` to a development version of the next minor release (e.g., `\"1.14.0.dev\"`). All pull requests should have `main` as the merge base.\n\nPatch releases should be made by cherry-picking commits from `main` onto the release branch (e.g., `v1.13.x`) in a pull request labeled `backport`.\n\n\n## How to set up your local development environment\n\n### Basic\n\n``` sh\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri\ncd nokogiri\nbundle install\n```\n\n\n### Advanced\n\nPlease install the latest or previous version of CRuby (e.g., 3.2 or 3.1 as of 2023-01), and a recent version of JRuby. We recommend using `rbenv`, which is used in test scripts when necessary to test gems against multiple rubies.\n\nPlease install a system version of libxml2/libxslt (see [Installing Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html#installing-using-standard-system-libraries) for details) so that you can test against both the packaged libraries and your system libraries.\n\nWe recommend that you install `valgrind` if you can, but it's only necessary for debugging problems so feel free to wait until you need it. (I'm not sure valgrind is easily available on MacOS.)\n\nIf you plan to package precompiled native gems, make sure `docker` is installed and is working properly.\n\n\n## How to run the tests\n\nNote that `rake test` does not compile the native extension, and this is intentional (so we can run the test suite against an installed gem). If you're modifying the extension code, please make sure you re-compile each time you run the tests to ensure you're testing your changes.\n\n\n### The short version\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake compile test\n```\n\nTo run a focused test, use Minitest's `TESTOPTS`:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake compile test TESTOPTS=\"-n/test_last_element_child/\"\n```\n\nOr to run tests on specific files, use `TESTGLOB`:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake compile test TESTGLOB=\"test/**/test_*node*rb\"\n```\n\n\nTo run the test suite in parallel, set the `NCPU` environment variable; and to compile in parallel, set the `MAKEFLAGS` environment variable (you may want to set these in something like your .bashrc):\n\n``` sh\nexport NCPU=8\nexport MAKEFLAGS=-j8\nbundle exec rake compile test\n```\n\n\n### CRuby advanced usage\n\nTest using your system's libraries:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake clean  #  blow away pre-existing libraries using packaged libs\nbundle exec rake compile test -- --enable-system-libraries\n```\n\nRun performance tests:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake compile test:bench\n```\n\n\nRun tests using valgrind:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake compile test:valgrind\n```\n\n\nRun tests in the debugger:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake compile test:gdb\n# or\nbundle exec rake compile test:lldb\n```\n\n\nRun tests and look for memory leaks with valgrind and ruby_memcheck:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake compile test:memcheck\n```\n\n\nRun test/test_memory_usage.rb and look for memory leaks using RSS size and linear interpolation:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake compile test:memory_suite\n```\n\n\nNote that by you can run the test suite with a variety of GC behaviors. For example, running a major after each test completes has, on occasion, been useful for localizing some classes of memory bugs, but does slow the suite down. Some variations of the test suite behavior are available (see `test/helper.rb` for more info):\n\n``` sh\n# ordinary GC behavior\nNOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL=normal bundle exec rake compile test\n\n# minor GC after each test\nNOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL=minor bundle exec rake compile test\n\n# major GC after each test\nNOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL=major bundle exec rake compile test\n\n# major GC after each test and GC compaction after every 20 tests\nNOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL=compact bundle exec rake compile test\n\n# verify references after compaction after every 20 tests\n# (see https://alanwu.space/post/check-compaction/)\nNOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL=verify bundle exec rake compile test\n\n# run with GC \"stress mode\" on\nNOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL=stress bundle exec rake compile test\n```\n\n\n### libxml2 advanced usage\n\nIf you want to build Nokogiri against a modified version of libxml2 or libxslt, clone them both into sibling directories (`../libxml2` and `../libxslt`) then run `scripts/compile-against-libxml2-source`.\n\nThat script also takes an optional command to run with the proper environment variables set to use the local libxml2 library, which can be useful when trying to `git bisect` against libxml2 or libxslt. So, for example:\n\n``` sh\nscripts/compile-against-libxml2-source bundle exec rake test\n```\n\nAn alternative, if you're not bisecting or hacking on libxml2 or libxslt, is:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake compile -- \\\n  --with-xslt-source-dir=$(pwd)/../libxslt \\\n  --with-xml2-source-dir=$(pwd)/../libxml2\n```\n\n\n### gumbo HTML5 parser\n\nTo run the test suite for the gumbo parser:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake gumbo\n```\n\nPlease note that additional html5lib tests for Nokogiri's HTML5 parser exist in a submodule. If you haven't checked that submodule out, here's how to do so:\n\n``` sh\ngit submodule update --init  #  test/html5lib-tests\nbundle exec rake compile test\n```\n\nIf you're actively working on the libgumbo source, you will probably want a faster feedback loop than `rake clean compile test` will give you. Here's how to get more immediate builds of libgumbo whenever you change a file:\n\n``` sh\nbundle exec rake clean compile -- --gumbo-dev\n# change a gumbo file\nbundle exec rake compile # immediate compilation of changed file and relinking of nokogiri.so\n```\n\n\n### Fuzzing your gumbo HTML5 parser changes\n\nWhen making changes or adding new features to `gumbo-parser`, it's recommended to run [libfuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) against `gumbo-parser` using various [sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki).\n\nBuild the fuzzers by navigating to the `gumbo-parser` directory and running `make fuzzers`. Once built, navigate to the `gumbo-parser/fuzzer/build` directory and execute one of the following binaries in this directory:\n\n- parse_fuzzer (standard fuzzer with no sanitizer)\n- parse_fuzzer-asan (fuzzer built using [ASAN](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html))\n- parse_fuzzer-msan (fuzzer built using [MSAN](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html))\n- parse_fuzzer-ubsan (fuzzer built using [UBSAN](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html))\n\nTo fuzz more efficiently, use the dictionary (gumbo.dict) and corpus (gumbo_corpus) found in `gumbo-parser/fuzzer` using the following arguments (assuming parse_fuzzer is in use):\n\n```\n./parse_fuzzer -dict=../gumbo.dict ../gumbo_corpus\n```\n\nIf the binary executed successfully you should now be seeing the following output filling up your terminal (see https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#output for more information):\n\n```\nINFO: Seed: 4156947595\nINFO: Loaded 1 modules   (7149 inline 8-bit counters): 7149 0x58a462, 0x58c04f, \nINFO: Loaded 1 PC tables (7149 PCs): 7149 0x53beb0,0x557d80, \nINFO: -max_len is not provided; libFuzzer will not generate inputs larger than 4096 bytes\nINFO: A corpus is not provided, starting from an empty corpus\n#2\tINITED cov: 2 ft: 2 corp: 1/1b exec/s: 0 rss: 24Mb\n\tNEW_FUNC[1/44]: 0x429840 in gumbo_parse_with_options (/home/user/nokogiri/gumbo-parser/fuzzer/build/parse_fuzzer+0x429840)\n\tNEW_FUNC[2/44]: 0x42c0d0 in destroy_node (/home/user/nokogiri/gumbo-parser/fuzzer/build/parse_fuzzer+0x42c0d0)\n#721\tNEW    cov: 180 ft: 181 corp: 2/12b lim: 11 exec/s: 0 rss: 27Mb L: 11/11 MS: 4 ChangeByte-ChangeByte-ChangeBit-InsertRepeatedBytes-\n#722\tNEW    cov: 186 ft: 196 corp: 3/23b lim: 11 exec/s: 0 rss: 27Mb L: 11/11 MS: 1 ChangeBit-\n#723\tNEW    cov: 186 ft: 228 corp: 4/34b lim: 11 exec/s: 0 rss: 27Mb L: 11/11 MS: 1 ChangeBinInt-\n#724\tNEW    cov: 188 ft: 241 corp: 5/45b lim: 11 exec/s: 0 rss: 27Mb L: 11/11 MS: 1 ChangeBit-\n#725\tNEW    cov: 188 ft: 254 corp: 6/56b lim: 11 exec/s: 0 rss: 27Mb L: 11/11 MS: 1 ChangeByte-\n#726\tNEW    cov: 188 ft: 270 corp: 7/67b lim: 11 exec/s: 0 rss: 27Mb L: 11/11 MS: 1 CopyPart-\n#732\tNEW    cov: 188 ft: 279 corp: 8/78b lim: 11 exec/s: 0 rss: 27Mb L: 11/11 MS: 1 ChangeBit-\n\tNEW_FUNC[1/1]: 0x441de0 in gumbo_token_destroy (/home/user/nokogiri/gumbo-parser/fuzzer/build/parse_fuzzer+0x441de0)\n```\n\nHowever, if the fuzzer finds a \"crash\" (indicating that a bug has been found) it will stop fuzzing and the following output would be expected:\n\n```\nINFO: Seed: 1523017872\nINFO: Loaded 1 modules (16 guards): 0x744e60, 0x744ea0,\nINFO: -max_len is not provided, using 64\nINFO: A corpus is not provided, starting from an empty corpus\n#0    READ units: 1\n#1    INITED cov: 3 ft: 2 corp: 1/1b exec/s: 0 rss: 24Mb\n#3811 NEW    cov: 4 ft: 3 corp: 2/2b exec/s: 0 rss: 25Mb L: 1 MS: 5 ChangeBit-ChangeByte-ChangeBit-ShuffleBytes-ChangeByte-\n#3827 NEW    cov: 5 ft: 4 corp: 3/4b exec/s: 0 rss: 25Mb L: 2 MS: 1 CopyPart-\n#3963 NEW    cov: 6 ft: 5 corp: 4/6b exec/s: 0 rss: 25Mb L: 2 MS: 2 ShuffleBytes-ChangeBit-\n#4167 NEW    cov: 7 ft: 6 corp: 5/9b exec/s: 0 rss: 25Mb L: 3 MS: 1 InsertByte-\n==31511== ERROR: libFuzzer: deadly signal\n...\nartifact_prefix='./'; Test unit written to ./crash-b13e8756b13a00cf168300179061fb4b91fefbed\n```\n\nThe above indicates that a crash has been identified and it can be reproduced by feeding the `crash-b13e8756b13a00cf168300179061fb4b91fefbed` file back into the binary used for fuzzing (e.g. parse-fuzzer) using the following command:\n\n```\nparse_fuzzer crash-b13e8756b13a00cf168300179061fb4b91fefbed\n```\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about libfuzzer please give https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/tutorial/libFuzzerTutorial.md a try.\n\n\n## Style Guide\n\n### Documentation\n\nWe use `rdoc` to build Nokogiri's documentation. Run `rake rdoc` to build into the `./html` directory, and see the rdoc tasks in [rakelib/rdoc.rake](rakelib/rdoc.rake).\n\nPreviously we made some effort to move towards `yard` but that work was stopped (and the decision record can be found at [RFC: convert to use `yard` for documentation](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1996)).\n\nDocstrings should be in `RDoc::Markup` format, though simple docstrings may be in Markdown (using `:markup: markdown`).\n\nIf you submit pull requests that improve documentation, **I will happily merge them** and credit you in the CHANGELOG.\n\nSome guidelines (see [lib/nokogiri/xml/node.rb](lib/nokogiri/xml/node.rb) and [ext/nokogiri/xml/node.c](ext/nokogiri/xml/node.c) for examples):\n\n- Use `:call-seq:` to ...\n  - note the return type of the method whenever possible, e.g. `:call-seq: upcase(name) → String`\n  - name all the aliases of a method\n  - indicate block/yield usage of a method\n- Briefly explain the purpose of the method, what it returns, and what side effects it has\n- Method signatures\n  - Use a `[Parameters]` definition to note the expected types of all the parameters as a bulleted list\n  - Use a `[Returns]` definition to note the return type\n  - Use a `[Yields]` definition to note the block parameters\n  - use RBS syntax whenever possible to declare variable types\n- Callouts\n  - Use a `🛡` character for security-related notes\n  - Use a `⚠` character to warn the user about tricky usage\n  - Use a `💡` character to call attention to other important notes\n- Examples\n  - Prefer to **show** nuanced behavior in code examples, rather than try to explain it in prose.\n  - Use the line `*Example:* <Brief explanation>` to name examples and visually separate them\n  - Indent two extra columns to get code-block formatting\n- Metadata\n  - `See also:` should be used to call out related methods\n  - `Since` should be used to indicate the version in which the code was introduced\n\n\n### Code\n\nI don't feel very strongly about code style, but this project uses [Standard](https://github.com/standardrb/standard) for Ruby, and uses the `astyle` configuration laid out in `./rakelib/format.rake` for C and Java.\n\nYou can auto-format everything with `rake format`.\n\nThere are some pending Rubocop rules in `.rubocop_todo.yml`. If you'd like to fix them up, I will happily merge your pull request.\n\nFor C code, naming is currently inconsistent, but I am generally moving towards some guidelines that will make stack traces more readable and usable:\n\n- Public functions and functions bound to Ruby methods should start with `noko_` followed by the snake case class name.\n  - e.g., `noko_xml_sax_parser_context_...`\n- Static functions (file scope) do not need the \"noko\" prefix, but should be named with the snake case class name.\n  - e.g., `xml_sax_parser_context_...`\n- Ruby singleton methods should have `_s_` before the method name\n  - e.g., `noko_xml_sax_parser_context_s_io` for `Nokogiri::XML::SAX::ParserContext.io`\n- Ruby instance methods should have `__` before the method name\n  - e.g., `noko_xml_sax_parser_context__line` for `Nokogiri::XML::SAX::ParserContext#line`\n- Ruby attribute getters and setters should have `_get` or `_set` as a suffix\n  - e.g., `noko_xml_sax_parser_context__recovery_set` for `Nokogiri::XML::SAX::ParserContext#recovery=`\n\n\n## How Continuous Integration (\"CI\") is configured\n\nThe bulk of CI is running in Github Actions since May 2021: https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/actions\n\nHowever, we also run tests against 32-bit windows (which aren't supported by GA as of this writing) in Appveyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/flavorjones/nokogiri\n\nA known hole in CI coverage is the lack native gem tests for arm64-darwin.\n\n\n### Coverage\n\nThe `ci.yml` pipeline includes jobs to:\n\n- basic security sanity check and formatting check, using Rubocop\n- fast feedback for obvious failures: run against system libraries on vanilla ubuntu\n- run the Gumbo parser tests on ubuntu, macos, and windows\n- run on all supported versions of CRuby:\n    - once with packaged libraries\n    - once with system libraries\n    - once on valgrind (to look for memory bugs)\n- run the test suite looking for new memory leaks (using ruby_memcheck)\n- run on JRuby\n- run on TruffleRuby\n- run on a Musl (Alpine) system:\n    - against system libraries\n    - with valgrind using packaged libraries\n- run with libxml-ruby loaded (because this can interact with libxml2 in conflicting ways)\n    - against system libraries\n    - with valgrind using packaged libraries\n- build a \"ruby\" platform gem\n    - install and test on linux, macos, and windows\n- build native gems\n    - install and test against all supported versions of CRuby\n    - install and test on a variety of linux, macos, and windows systems\n- build a jruby gem, install and test it\n\nThe `upstream.yml` pipeline includes jobs to:\n\n- run against libxml2 and libxslt head (linux), including a valgrind check\n- run against CRuby head (linux, windows, macos) including a valgrind check\n- run against JRuby head\n- run html5lib-tests from that project's `origin/master`\n\nThe `downstream.yml` pipeline includes jobs to run notable downstream dependents against Nokogiri `main`.\n\nThe `generate-ci-images.yml` pipeline builds some containers used by the other pipelines once a week. This is primarily an optimization to make sure system packages (like `libxml2-dev` and `valgrind`) are already installed. See `oci-images/nokogiri-test/` for details on what's in these containers.\n\n\n### Valgrind and `ruby_memcheck`\n\nWe rely heavily on Valgrind and [`ruby_memcheck`](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby_memcheck) to catch memory bugs by running in combination with every version of CRuby.\n\nWe use suppressions primarily to quiet known small memory leaks or quirks of certain Ruby versions. See the files in the `/suppressions` directory and `/rakelib/test.rake` for more information.\n\n\n### Benchmark / Performance tests\n\nA separate suite, `test:bench`, can be run to ensure a few performance expectations. As of 2022-02 this suite is small, but we can grow it over time. These tests are run in CI on CRuby and JRuby.\n\nThese tests should use `Nokogiri::TestBenchmark` as the base class, and be in a file matching the glob `test/**/bench_*.rb`.\n\n\n### Helpful hints when writing new CI jobs\n\n- Always checkout the source code **including submodules** (for the html5lib tests)\n- When testing packaged libraries (not system libraries), cache either `ports/` (for compiled libraries) or `ports/archives/` (for just tarballs)\n  - note that `libgumbo` is built outside of `ports/` to allow us to do this caching safely\n\n\n## How OSS-Fuzz is configured\n\n[OSS-Fuzz](https://oss-fuzz.com/) is a service that runs fuzzing against open-source libraries.\n\nOSS-Fuzz was configured to fuzz Nokogiri's libgumbo in https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/11004. Updating the configuration should be done in that project.\n\nNotifications go to `nokogiri-oss-fuzz@googlegroups.com`.\n\nSome historical context can be found in [discussion #2992](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/discussions/2992) and [pull request #3007](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/pull/3007) by @fuzzy-boiii23a.\n\n\n## Packaging releases\n\nAs a prerequisite please make sure you have `docker` correctly installed, to build native (precompiled) gems.\n\nRun `scripts/build-gems` which will package gems for all supported platforms, and run some basic sanity tests on those packages using `scripts/test-gem-set`, `scripts/test-gem-file-contents`, and `scripts/test-gem-installation`.\n\nSee [Making a release](#making-a-release) below for the checklist.\n\n\n## Other utilities\n\n`scripts/test-exported-symbols` checks the compiled `nokogiri.so` library for surprising exported symbols. This script likely only works on Linux, sorry.\n\n`scripts/files-modified-by-open-prs` is a hack to see what files are being proposed to change in the set of open pull requests. This might be useful if you're thinking about radically changing a file, to be aware of what merge conflicts might result. This could probably be a rake task.\n\nThere's a `Vagrantfile` in the project root which I've used once or twice to try to reproduce problems non-Linux systems (like OpenBSD). It's not well-maintained so YMMV.\n\n\n## Bumping Java dependencies\n\nJava dependencies, in the form of `.jar` files, are all vendored as part of the `java` platform gem.\n\nWe use [`jar-dependencies`](https://github.com/mkristian/jar-dependencies) as a development dependency to manage the project's Java dependencies. Note, however, that we use our own fork of NekoDTD that lives at https://github.com/sparklemotion/nekodtd\n\nTo modify or add a dependency, a few things needs to be in sync:\n\n- `nokogiri.gemspec`: `spec.requirements` need to specify the maven group Id, artifact ID, and version\n- `nokogiri.gemspec`: `spec.files` need to include the jar files\n- git: the jar files under `lib/nokogiri/jruby/` need to be committed to git\n- `lib/nokogiri/jruby/nokogiri_jars.rb`: needs to include all the jars\n\nA quick summary of what this looks like for you, the developer:\n\n1. edit the `requirements` in the gemspec\n2. run `bundle exec rake vendor_jars` which updates everything under `lib/nokogiri/jruby`\n3. run `bundle exec rake check_manifest` and if necessary update the gemspec `files`\n4. make sure to check everything under `lib/nokogiri/jruby` into git, including the jar files\n\n\n## Rake tasks\n\nThe `Rakefile` used to be a big fat mess. It's now decomposed into a small set of files in `/rakelib`. If you've got a new rake task you'd like to introduce, please consider whether it belongs in one of the existing concerns, or needs a new file. Please don't add it to `Rakefile` without compelling reasons.\n\n\n## Making a release\n\nA quick checklist for releasing Nokogiri:\n\n- Prechecks\n  - [ ] make sure CI is green!\n  - [ ] update `CHANGELOG.md` and `lib/nokogiri/version/constant.rb`\n  - [ ] commit and create a git tag\n  - [ ] run `scripts/build-gems` and make sure it completes and all the tests pass\n- Release\n  - [ ] `git push && git push --tags`\n  - [ ] `for g in gems/*.gem ; do gem push $g ; done`\n  - [ ] create a release at https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/releases and provide sha2 checksums\n- If the release has security fixes ...\n  - [ ] publish a GHSA\n  - [ ] email ruby-security-ann@googlegroups.com and ruby-talk@ruby-lang.org\n- Post-release\n  - [ ] update nokogiri.org\n  - [ ] bump `lib/nokogiri/version/constant.rb` to a prerelease version like `v1.14.0.dev`\n"

It's not present in default, JavaⓇ, or native LinuxⓇ releases.\n\n\n## Platform Releases\n\n### Default platform release (\"ruby\")\n\nThe default platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n\n* [libxml2](#libxml2)\n* [libxslt](#libxslt)\n* [libgumbo](#libgumbo)\n\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"ruby\" for its \"platform\" attribute.\n\n\n### Native LinuxⓇ platform releases (\"x86_64-linux\", \"aarch64-linux\", and \"arm-linux\")\n\nThe native LinuxⓇ platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n\n* [libxml2](#libxml2)\n* [libxslt](#libxslt)\n* [libgumbo](#libgumbo)\n* [zlib](#zlib)\n\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-linux\" or \"aarch64-linux\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute.\n\n\n### Native Darwin (macOSⓇ) platform releases (\"x86_64-darwin\" and \"arm64-darwin\")\n\nThe native Darwin platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n\n* [libxml2](#libxml2)\n* [libxslt](#libxslt)\n* [libgumbo](#libgumbo)\n* [zlib](#zlib)\n* [libiconv](#libiconv)\n\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-darwin\" or \"arm64-darwin\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute. Darwin is also known more familiarly as \"OSX\" or \"macOSⓇ\" and is the operating system for many AppleⓇ computers.\n\n\n### Native WindowsⓇ platform releases (\"x64-mingw-ucrt\")\n\nThe native WindowsⓇ platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n\n* [libxml2](#libxml2)\n* [libxslt](#libxslt)\n* [libgumbo](#libgumbo)\n* [zlib](#zlib)\n* [libiconv](#libiconv)\n\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x64-mingw-ucrt\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute.\n\n\n### JavaⓇ (JRuby) platform release (\"java\")\n\nThe Java platform release distributes the following dependencies as compiled jar files:\n\n* [isorelax:isorelax](#isorelaxisorelax)\n* [net.sf.saxon:Saxon-HE](#netsfsaxonsaxon-he)\n* [net.sourceforge.htmlunit:neko-htmlunit](#netsourceforgehtmlunitneko-htmlunit)\n* [nu.validator:jing](#nuvalidatorjing)\n* [org.nokogiri:nekodtd](#orgnokogirinekodtd)\n* [xalan:serializer and xalan:xalan](#xalanserializer-and-xalanxalan)\n* [xerces:xercesImpl](#xercesxercesimpl)\n* [xml-apis:xml-apis](#xml-apisxml-apis)\n\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"java\" for its \"platform.os\" attribute.\n\n\n## Appendix: Dependencies' License Texts\n\nThis section contains a subsection for each potentially-distributed dependency, which includes the name of the license and the license text.\n\nPlease see previous sections to understand which of these potential dependencies is actually distributed in the gem file you're downloading and using.\n\n\n### hashmap.c\n\nMIT\n\nhttps://github.com/tidwall/hashmap.c/blob/master/LICENSE\n\n    The MIT License (MIT)\n\n    Copyright (c) 2020 Joshua J Baker\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\n    this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\n    the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\n    use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\n    the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\n    subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n    copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\n    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n       7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n### libxml2\n\nMIT\n\nhttp://xmlsoft.org/\n\n    Except where otherwise noted in the source code (e.g. the files hash.c,\n    list.c and the trio files, which are covered by a similar licence but\n    with different Copyright notices) all the files are:\n\n     Copyright (C) 1998-2012 Daniel Veillard.

It is\n     numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n                    Preamble\n\n      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n      This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\n    specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\n    other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\n    your libraries, too.\n\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n    you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\n      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n    code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\n    complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\n    with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n      Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n    the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n      Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\n    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n    library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n    version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n    the original authors' reputations.\n    \f\n      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n    software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n    transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n    we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n    free use or not licensed at all.\n\n      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n    GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n    license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n    designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n    one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n    the same as in the ordinary license.\n\n      The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n    they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n    program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n    changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n    analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n    a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n    derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n    treats it as such.\n\n      Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n    Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n    sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n    concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\n      However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n    users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n    libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n    permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n    preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n    libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\n    this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\n    changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\n    will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n    \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n    former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\n    works together with the library.\n\n      Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\n    General Public License rather than by this special one.\n    \f\n              GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\n    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\n    party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\n    General Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\n    addressed as \"you\".\n\n      A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n      The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n    which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n    Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n    included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n      \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n    and installation of the library.\n\n      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n    and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n    Library.\n\n      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n    fee.\n    \f\n      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n        in the event an application does not supply such function or\n        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n        its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n        application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n        root function must still compute square roots.)\n\n    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n    it.\n\n    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n    collective works based on the Library.\n\n    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n    the scope of this License.\n\n      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n    these notices.\n    \f\n      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n    the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n    medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n    linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n      However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n    contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n    library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n      When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n    Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n    \f\n      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\n    link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n    engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n    of these things:\n\n        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n        uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n        to use the modified definitions.)\n\n        b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n        least three years, to give the same user the materials\n        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n        than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n        c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n        specified materials from the same place.\n\n        d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n      For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n    Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n    the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\n    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n    the executable.\n\n      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n    distribute.\n    \f\n      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n        Sections above.\n\n        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n    the Library or works based on it.\n\n      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n    this License.\n    \f\n      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n    integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n    impose that choice.\n\n    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n    be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n    written in the body of this License.\n\n      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n    versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\n    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n    \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n    the Free Software Foundation.\n    \f\n      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n    and reuse of software generally.\n\n                    NO WARRANTY\n\n      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n    PURPOSE.

Limitations on Grant Scope\n\n    The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n    this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n    distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n    Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n    Contributor:\n\n    (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n        or\n\n    (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n\n    (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n        its Contributions.\n\n    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n    or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n    the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n    2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n    No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n    distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n    License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n    permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n    2.5.

Distribution of Source Form\n\n    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n    Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n    the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n    Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n    attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n    Form.\n\n    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n    (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n        Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n        the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n        Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n        than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n    (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n        the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n    provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n    the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n    Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n    Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n    License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n    under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n    the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n    Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n    License(s).\n\n    3.4. Notices\n\n    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n    (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n    or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n    the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n    the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n    3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n    You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n    Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n    behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n    such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n    jurisdiction.\n\n    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n    ---------------------------------------------------\n\n    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n    be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n    Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n    or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n    recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n    5. Termination\n    --------------\n\n    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n    if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n    compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n    Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n    ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n    non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n    come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n    Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n    notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n    first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n    from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n    Your receipt of the notice.\n\n    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n    counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n    You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n    2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n    have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n    prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n    ************************************************************************\n    *                                                                      *\n    *  6.

It provides a sensible, easy-to-understand API for [reading](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/parsing_an_html_xml_document.html), writing, [modifying](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/modifying_an_html_xml_document.html), and [querying](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/searching_a_xml_html_document.html) documents. It is fast and standards-compliant by relying on native parsers like libxml2, libgumbo, and xerces.\n\n## Guiding Principles\n\nSome guiding principles Nokogiri tries to follow:\n\n- be secure-by-default by treating all documents as **untrusted** by default\n- be a **thin-as-reasonable layer** on top of the underlying parsers, and don't attempt to fix behavioral differences between the parsers\n\n\n## Features Overview\n\n- DOM Parser for XML, HTML4, and HTML5\n- SAX Parser for XML and HTML4\n- Push Parser for XML and HTML4\n- Document search via XPath 1.0\n- Document search via CSS3 selectors, with some jquery-like extensions\n- XSD Schema validation\n- XSLT transformation\n- \"Builder\" DSL for XML and HTML documents\n\n\n## Status\n\n[![Github Actions CI](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n[![Appveyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xj2pqwvlxwuwgr06/branch/main?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/flavorjones/nokogiri/branch/main)\n\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/nokogiri.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri)\n[![SemVer compatibility](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=nokogiri&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=1.11.7&new-version=1.12.5)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\n[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/5344/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/5344)\n[![Tidelift dependencies](https://tidelift.com/badges/package/rubygems/nokogiri)](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/rubygems-nokogiri?utm_source=rubygems-nokogiri&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme)\n\n\n## Support, Getting Help, and Reporting Issues\n\nAll official documentation is posted at https://nokogiri.org (the source for which is at https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri.org/, and we welcome contributions).\n\n### Reading\n\nYour first stops for learning more about Nokogiri should be:\n\n- [API Documentation](https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/index.html)\n- [Tutorials](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/toc.html)\n- An excellent community-maintained [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/wiki/Cheat-sheet)\n\n\n### Ask For Help\n\nThere are a few ways to ask exploratory questions:\n\n- The Nokogiri mailing list is active at https://groups.google.com/group/nokogiri-talk\n- Open an issue using the \"Help Request\" template at https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues\n- Open a discussion at https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/discussions\n\nPlease do not mail the maintainers at their personal addresses.\n\n\n### Report A Bug\n\nThe Nokogiri bug tracker is at https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues\n\nPlease use the \"Bug Report\" or \"Installation Difficulties\" templates.\n\n\n### Security and Vulnerability Reporting\n\nPlease report vulnerabilities at https://hackerone.com/nokogiri\n\nFull information and description of our security policy is in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)\n\n\n### Semantic Versioning Policy\n\nNokogiri follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (since 2017 or so). [![Dependabot's SemVer compatibility score for Nokogiri](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=nokogiri&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=1.11.7&new-version=1.12.5)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nWe bump `Major.Minor.Patch` versions following this guidance:\n\n`Major`: (we've never done this)\n\n- Significant backwards-incompatible changes to the public API that would require rewriting existing application code.\n- Some examples of backwards-incompatible changes we might someday consider for a Major release are at [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).\n\n`Minor`:\n\n- Features and bugfixes.\n- Updating packaged libraries for non-security-related reasons.\n- Dropping support for EOLed Ruby versions. [Some folks find this objectionable](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1568), but [SemVer says this is OK if the public API hasn't changed](https://semver.org/#what-should-i-do-if-i-update-my-own-dependencies-without-changing-the-public-api).\n- Backwards-incompatible changes to internal or private methods and constants. These are detailed in the \"Changes\" section of each changelog entry.\n- Removal of deprecated methods or parameters, after a generous transition period; usually when those methods or parameters are rarely-used or dangerous to the user. Essentially, removals that do not justify a major version bump.\n\n\n`Patch`:\n\n- Bugfixes.\n- Security updates.\n- Updating packaged libraries for security-related reasons.\n\n\n### Sponsorship\n\nYou can help sponsor the maintainers of this software through one of these organizations:\n\n- [github.com/sponsors/flavorjones](https://github.com/sponsors/flavorjones)\n- [opencollective.com/nokogiri](https://opencollective.com/nokogiri)\n- [tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/rubygems-nokogiri](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/rubygems-nokogiri?utm_source=rubygems-nokogiri&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Ruby >= 3.1\n- JRuby >= 9.4.0.0\n\nIf you are compiling the native extension against a system version of libxml2:\n\n- libxml2 >= 2.9.2 (recommended >= 2.12.0)\n\n\n### Native Gems: Faster, more reliable installation\n\n\"Native gems\" contain pre-compiled libraries for a specific machine architecture. On supported platforms, this removes the need for compiling the C extension and the packaged libraries, or for system dependencies to exist. This results in **much faster installation** and **more reliable installation**, which as you probably know are the biggest headaches for Nokogiri users.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nNokogiri ships pre-compiled, \"native\" gems for the following platforms:\n\n- Linux:\n  - `x86_64-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-linux-gnu`, and `arm-linux-gnu` (req: `glibc >= 2.29`)\n  - `x86_64-linux-musl`, `aarch64-linux-musl`, and `arm-linux-musl`\n- Darwin/MacOS: `x86_64-darwin` and `arm64-darwin`\n- Windows: `x64-mingw-ucrt`\n- Java: any platform running JRuby 9.4 or higher\n\nTo determine whether your system supports one of these gems, look at the output of `bundle platform` or `ruby -e 'puts Gem::Platform.local.to_s'`.\n\nIf you're on a supported platform, either `gem install` or `bundle install` should install a native gem without any additional action on your part. This installation should only take a few seconds, and your output should look something like:\n\n``` sh\n$ gem install nokogiri\nFetching nokogiri-1.11.0-x86_64-linux.gem\nSuccessfully installed nokogiri-1.11.0-x86_64-linux\n1 gem installed\n```\n\n\n### Other Installation Options\n\nBecause Nokogiri is a C extension, it requires that you have a C compiler toolchain, Ruby development header files, and some system dependencies installed.\n\nThe following may work for you if you have an appropriately-configured system:\n\n``` bash\ngem install nokogiri\n```\n\nIf you have any issues, please visit [Installing Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html) for more complete instructions and troubleshooting.\n\n\n## How To Use Nokogiri\n\nNokogiri is a large library, and so it's challenging to briefly summarize it. We've tried to provide long, real-world examples at [Tutorials](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/toc.html).\n\n### Parsing and Querying\n\nHere is example usage for parsing and querying a document:\n\n```ruby\n#! /usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'nokogiri'\nrequire 'open-uri'\n\n# Fetch and parse HTML document\ndoc = Nokogiri::HTML(URI.open('https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html'))\n\n# Search for nodes by css\ndoc.css('nav ul.menu li a', 'article h2').each do |link|\n  puts link.content\nend\n\n# Search for nodes by xpath\ndoc.xpath('//nav//ul//li/a', '//article//h2').each do |link|\n  puts link.content\nend\n\n# Or mix and match\ndoc.search('nav ul.menu li a', '//article//h2').each do |link|\n  puts link.content\nend\n```\n\n\n### Encoding\n\nStrings are always stored as UTF-8 internally.  Methods that return\ntext values will always return UTF-8 encoded strings.  Methods that\nreturn a string containing markup (like `to_xml`, `to_html` and\n`inner_html`) will return a string encoded like the source document.\n\n__WARNING__\n\nSome documents declare one encoding, but actually use a different\none. In these cases, which encoding should the parser choose?\n\nData is just a stream of bytes. Humans add meaning to that stream. Any\nparticular set of bytes could be valid characters in multiple\nencodings, so detecting encoding with 100% accuracy is not\npossible. `libxml2` does its best, but it can't be right all the time.\n\nIf you want Nokogiri to handle the document encoding properly, your\nbest bet is to explicitly set the encoding.  Here is an example of\nexplicitly setting the encoding to EUC-JP on the parser:\n\n```ruby\n  doc = Nokogiri.XML('<foo><bar /></foo>', nil, 'EUC-JP')\n```\n\n\n## Technical Overview\n\n### Guiding Principles\n\nAs noted above, two guiding principles of the software are:\n\n- be secure-by-default by treating all documents as **untrusted** by default\n- be a **thin-as-reasonable layer** on top of the underlying parsers, and don't attempt to fix behavioral differences between the parsers\n\nNotably, despite all parsers being standards-compliant, there are behavioral inconsistencies between the parsers used in the CRuby and JRuby implementations, and Nokogiri does not and should not attempt to remove these inconsistencies. Instead, we surface these differences in the test suite when they are important/semantic; or we intentionally write tests to depend only on the important/semantic bits (omitting whitespace from regex matchers on results, for example).\n\n\n### CRuby\n\nThe Ruby (a.k.a., CRuby, MRI, YARV) implementation is a C extension that depends on libxml2 and libxslt (which in turn depend on zlib and possibly libiconv).\n\nThese dependencies are met by default by Nokogiri's packaged versions of the libxml2 and libxslt source code, but a configuration option `--use-system-libraries` is provided to allow specification of alternative library locations. See [Installing Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html) for full documentation.\n\nWe provide native gems by pre-compiling libxml2 and libxslt (and potentially zlib and libiconv) and packaging them into the gem file. In this case, no compilation is necessary at installation time, which leads to faster and more reliable installation.\n\nSee [`LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md`](LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md) for more information on which dependencies are provided in which native and source gems.\n\n\n### JRuby\n\nThe Java (a.k.a. JRuby) implementation is a Java extension that depends primarily on Xerces and NekoHTML for parsing, though additional dependencies are on `isorelax`, `nekodtd`, `jing`, `serializer`, `xalan-j`, and `xml-apis`.\n\nThese dependencies are provided by pre-compiled jar files packaged in the `java` platform gem.\n\nSee [`LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md`](LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md) for more information on which dependencies are provided in which native and source gems.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for an intro guide to developing Nokogiri.\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nWe've adopted the Contributor Covenant code of conduct, which you can read in full in [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\n\nSee this license at [`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md).\n\n\n### Dependencies\n\nSome additional libraries may be distributed with your version of Nokogiri.

How bad are things?\nSomebody who knows encoding well should head this up.\n\n* Extract EncodingReader as a real object that can be injected\n  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/nokogiri-talk/arJeAtMqvkg/tGihB-iBRSAJ\n\n\n## Reader\n\nIt's fundamentally broken, in that we can't stop people from crashing\ntheir application if they want to use object reference unsafely.\n\n\n## Class methods that require Document\n\nThere are a few methods, like `Nokogiri::XML::Comment.new` that\nrequire a Document object.\n\nWe should probably make Document instance methods to wrap this, since\nit's a non-obvious expectation and thus fails as a convention.\n\nSo, instead, let's make alternative methods like\n`Nokogiri::XML::Document#new_comment`, and recommend those as the\nproper convention.\n\n\n## `collect_namespaces` is just broken\n\n`collect_namespaces` is returning a hash, which means it can't return\nnamespaces with the same prefix. See this issue for background:\n\n> [#885](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/885)\n\nDo we care? This seems like a useless method, but then again I hate\nXML, so what do I know?\n\n\n## Overhaul `ParseOptions`\n\nCurrently we mirror libxml2's parse options, and then retrofit those options on top of Xerces-J for JRuby.\n\n* I'd like to identify which options work across both parsers,\n* And overhaul the parse methods so that these options are easier to use.\n\nBy \"easier to use\" I mean:\n\n* it's unwieldy to create a block to set/unset parse options\n* it's unwieldy to create a constant like `MY_PARSE_OPTIONS = Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::STRICT | Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::RECOVER ...`\n* some options are named dangerously poorly, like `NOENT` which [does the opposite of what it says](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1582#issuecomment-562180275)\n* semantically some options should be set/unset together, specifically \"this is a trusted document\" or \"this is an untrusted document\" should flip the senses of `NONET` and `NOENT` and `DTDLOAD` together.\n* we need the ability to invent new parse options, like the one suggested in [#1582](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1582) that would allow local entities but not external entities.\n"

When escalating in that venue, please do not discuss your issue. Simply say that you're trying to get a hold of someone from the core team.\n\nThe information you share with the Nokogiri Core Contributors as part of this process will be kept confidential within the team, unless or until we need to share information upstream with our dependent libraries' core teams, at which point we will notify you.\n\nIf a vulnerability is first reported by you, we will credit you with the discovery in the public disclosure.\n"
