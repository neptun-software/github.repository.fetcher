It focuses on the inherent challenges of multiplayer online games such as latency, jitter and packet loss, mitigating through sophisticated algorithms and techniques, including prediction, compensation, reconciliation, interpolation and other mechanisms. It is also often deeply involved and integrated with other game systems such as physics, animation and gameplay.\n\n## Articles\n\n- [1500 Archers on a 28.8: Network Programming in Age of Empires and Beyond](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/1500-archers-on-a-28-8-network-programming-in-age-of-empires-and-beyond) - Mark Terrano, Paul Bettner.\n- [Alvaro Jover-Alvarez's Blog](https://vorixo.github.io/devtricks/) - Various articles on Unreal Engine 5 multiplayer by Alvaro Jover-Alvarez.\n- [Choosing TCP or UDP: a guide for game developers](https://web.archive.org/web/20210415231950/https://heroiclabs.com/docs/expert-tcp-udp/) - Basic TCP vs UDP comparison by Heroic Labs.\n- [Close Look: Halo Infinite's Online Experience](https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/closer-look-halo-infinite-online-experience) - Discussing netcode issues and mitigations by Richard Watson.\n- [Don't use Lockstep in RTS games](https://blog.istrolid.com/blog/dont-use-lockstep-in-rts-games.html) - Comparing Lockstep vs Client-Server Networking Models for RTS.\n- [Ethernet vs. WiFi](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231135556/https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/ethernet-vs-wifi-ping-packets-playing-better) - Connection over WiFi vs Ethernet metrics comparison by Viscarious from Riot Games.\n- [Explaining Delay-based and Rollback Netcode](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/explaining-how-fighting-games-use-delay-based-and-rollback-netcode/) - Rollback netcode for fighting games by Ricky Pusch.\n- [Fast-Paced Multiplayer](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) - Prediction, reconciliation, interpolation and compensation by Gabriel Gambetta.\n- [Fightin' Words, Netcode](http://ki.infil.net/w02-netcode.html) - Articles explaining how fighting games use delay-based and rollback netcode.\n- [Fight The Lag!
