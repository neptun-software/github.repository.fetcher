Big thanks to @tuffnatty for this!\n- CHANGE: #4553 Application has moved to Qt 6 (dropping Qt 5 support). This solves several technical issues (for example accented characters on MacOS, better UI scaling for high DPI displays, better dark theme support and more).\n- CHANGE: #5102 All raster icons are replaced with vector icons (SVG). This makes them scalable and work well with high DPI displays.\n- BUGFIX: #3995 Fixed blank MDI window buttons when using 150% interface scaling under Windows.\n- BIGFIX: #3146 Fixed accent characters support under MacOS.\n\n### 3.4.13\n- BUGFIX: #5183 Fixed completer proposals in the column names of the INSERT INTO statement.\n- BUGFIX: #5184 Fixed completer to show tables from implicitly attached database in case of 'SELECT other_database.'\n- BUGFIX: System tables (sqlite_*) are now pushed further in the competer proposals.\n- BUGFIX: Restored missing completer entries: string, number, BLOB literal.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed Linux installer issue related to the logname command on some Linux distributions.\n\n### 3.4.12\n- BIGFIX: #5179 Fixed results returned from query joining the same table twice.\n- BIGFIX: #5179 Fixed smart execution when joining tables with USING clause, so the result metadata is extracted properly and results can be edited.\n\n### 3.4.11\n- CHANGE: SQLite updated to 3.47.2\n- BUGFIX: #5161 An ultimate fix for dialog windows positioning, so they no longer can appear outside of visible screen.\n- BUGFIX: #4882 Fixed Rows Affected counter for huge numbers (over 2 trillion).\n\n### 3.4.10\n- CHANGE: #5160 The taskbar has been improved to make the currently active task more distinct from the others.\n- BUGFIX: #5148 Fixed counting of tables in queries transparently attaching other databases.\n- BIGFIX: #5162 Fixed crash when enabling STRICT option in Table Window.\n- BIGFIX: Fixed dialog windows positioning, so it's remembered correctly if the dialog is only moved, but not resized.\n- BIGFIX: System tables are again being presented on the database list if the app is configured to do so.\n\n### 3.4.9\n- BUGFIX: #5148 Fixed executing queries that refer to tables with database prefix (i.e. dbName.tableName).\n- BUGFIX: #5149 Relaxed recent limitation on requiring Custom SQL Functions to have unique names, so that names can duplicate if input parameters differ.\n\n### 3.4.8\n- CHANGE: #5146 If user enters a relative file path to the database dialog, a warning will issued to the user pointing out actual resolved path for the relative path entered.\n- BUGFIX: #5145 Fixed Extensions Manager crashing the app if the percentile extension was loaded before.

Now it can work with huge files, although all smart helpers (e.g. syntax highlighting, etc) are disabled in such window.\n- BUGFIX: #4872 Fixed executing SQL directly from file, so it does not skip CREATE TRIEGGER statements.\n- BUGFIX: #4871 Fixed executing SQL directly from file, so it no longer disables foreign key checks during execution.\n- BUGFIX: #4874 Fixed Foreign Key dropdown in data grid when foreign key references 2 different tables with same foreign column name in both referenced tables.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed tiny memory leak in the import() function.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed import() function options parser, so it no longer overwrites import plugin configuration with incorrect types of configuration values (i.e. string 'true' instead of expected boolean).\n- BUGFIX: #5096 Fixed executing large DDL scripts (more than 100 DDL statements) with CREATE TRIGGER in them.\n- BUGFIX: #4831 Fixed warning message of forbidded cell edition when trying to do it on a multi-level View results, where the View was given an alias name. Now the warning is clear about forbidden edition due to multi-level View.\n- BUGFIX: #5077 Fixed question dialog for going back to structure tab if there are uncommited structure changes (thanks to @marcpley).\n- BUGFIX: #5076 Fixed broken order of data insertion when adding new row to a table with GENERATED column (thanks to @marcpley).\n- BUGFIX: #4949 Added extra calls for cleaning up WAL files upon application exit.\n- BUGFIX: #4934 Fixed copying (drag&drop or copy&paste) tables between databases when a column in the table requires quoting due to being a keyword.\n- BUGFIX: #5076 Fixed unchecking Named Constraint option in constraint configuration (thanks to @marcpley).\n- BUGFIX: #5083 Improved cell editing behavior, so entering edition with Enter key or mouse Double-Click no longer preselects whole value.\n- BUGFIX: #5091 Fixed custom SQL functions editor to prevent duplicated argument names. Also fixed correct argumentName-to-value assignment if arguments share same initial part of their name. Also fixed handling of differnt type of arguments passed to custom SQL function.\n- BUGFIX: #5074 #5082 #5083 Fixed cell editing to preselect proper FK value from dropdown, to correctly load cell value if it containts single quote character and to have proper content selection depending on how editing is triggered.\n- BUGFIX: #5082 When editing FK value inline (not from dropdown), the autocompleted value also updates selection of item in the dropdown (yet to be shown if user chooses so). This also fixes up/down keyboard navigation basing on autocompleted value.\n- BUGFIX: #4959 GitHub Actions Linux build: include qt5-qtwayland to fix segfault in AlmaLinux 9.3 (thanks to @tuffnatty).\n- BUGFIX: #4980 Bunch of SchemaResolver optimizations, resulting in huge performance boost when opening/modifying databases with thousands of tables (from minutes down to milliseconds for opening database with ~6000 tables).\n- BUGFIX: #5065 Improved handling of columns named 'true' or 'false', which are allowed in SQLite, but are treated in a very unusual way by SQLite.\n\n### 3.4.4\n- ADDED: #3488 SQLite ICU extension is boundled into binary packages (thanks to @tuffnatty).\n- ADDED: #4697 Added a 'Restore original hotkey' buttons at keyboard shortcuts page of configuration dialog.\n- ADDED: Added sqlar extension to the default set of extensions provided with binary packages.\n- CHANGE: #4689 Sorting order is not cleared when table data is refreshed. To removed sorting order user can either double-click on header (once or twice) to restore no sorting for a column, or use context menu to clear any sorting.\n- CHANGE: #4735 Order of functions loading has changed. Now it's: built-in, extension-provided, user-defined. The last loaded has the highest precedense.\n- CHANGE: #4732 SQLite updated to 3.41.2 (except for SQLCipher, which is still on 3.39.4 at the moment).\n- CHANGE: #4683 Custom syntax highlighting colors now use theme-based colors by default (to work well with dynamically changing color palette in night/day theme changes) and can be explicitly enabled in configuration.\n- BUGFIX: #4676 #4716 #4693 #4701 #4669 #4721 Few critical fixes for Query Executor, fixing a frequent error: near \")\": syntax error.\n- BUGFIX: #4685 Fixed WINDOW/OVER/FILTER keyword handling in the SQL parser.\n- BUGFIX: #4694 Fixed messages for toolbar buttons in Code Snippets window & fixed loading translations for plugins.\n- BUGFIX: #4698 Fixed handling object names with '{' and '}' in their names.\n- BUGFIX: #4681 Fixed risk of null reference call in the SqliteOrderBy.\n- BUGFIX: #4707 Fixed database file selection dialog, so it doesn't complaint about read-only files.\n- BUGFIX: #4679 Fixed issue with case sensivity of CTE alias.\n- BUGFIX: #4697 Changed default hotkey for rolling back pending changes in table data from Ctrl+Backspace to Alt+Shit+Backspace. Default hotkey affects new users and will not change automatically for those who upgrade from older SQLiteStudio.\n- BUGFIX: #4739 Fixed committing changes in Extensions Manager if modifying valid extension settings, while there is another invalid, yet untouched extension on the list.\n- BUGFIX: #4715 Fixed the UPDATE OF column popup on MacOSX.\n- BUGFIX: #4754 Fixed Windows uninstaller to not create separate uninstall entries in Windows registry per each SQLiteStudio version and added SQLiteStudio icon for the uninstall entry in Windows Add/Remove programs.\n- BUGFIX: Tcl plugin compilation improved on Ubuntu 18.04 (thanks to @tuffnatty).\n\n### 3.4.3\n- CHANGE: #4631 Linux binaries are built again back on Ubuntu 20.04 (instead of 22.04) to make it compatible for more Linux machines.\n- BUGFIX: #4660 Removed unnecessary linking to curses library in Linux build file.\n- BUGFIX: #4658 Fixed crash when SQL parser stack gets overflown.\n\n### 3.4.2\n- ADDED: #4653 For dealing with small fractional numbers there is an option now to change Grid View representation of these numbers to a scientific notation - the option is in Configuration/Data Browsing.\n- CHANGE: #4535 Improved current query highlighter, so it considers query on the left of the cursor as current in a more intuitive way.\n- BUGFIX: #4602 Fixed editing data in table with Russian upper-case name.\n- BUGFIX: #4105 Fixed Import Dialog state update when changing import source (CSV vs RegExp), which could cause inability to proceed with the import in some cases.\n- BUGFIX: #3767 Fixed copying objects between unencrypted and encrypted databases, also fixed copying tables with generated columns.\n- BUGFIX: #4422 Portable configuration also prevents SQLiteStudio from touching Windows registry.\n- BUGFIX: #3759 Fixed using independent SQLiteStudio instances by different Unix users simultaneously, regardless of one's settings.\n- BUGFIX: #4198 When copying/moving table with name-colliding index (or trigger) to another database, the name conflict resolution now actually works.\n- BUGFIX: #3541 Standardized commit/rollback hotkeys for: functions editor, extensions editor, collations editor, snippets editor, table window structure tab, view window query tab.\n- BUGFIX: #4607 Fixed bug in Query Executor, that caused selecting ROWID from a View, without expanding the view in the first place, thus causing smart execution to fail.\n- BUGFIX: #4607 Fixed Query Executor to apply column sorting correctly even in Simple Execution method.\n- BUGFIX: #4614 Fixed opening object links in SQL editor to be case-insensitive.\n- BUGFIX: #4618 Fixed query executor when using filer on a View.\n- BUGFIX: #4613 Fixed per-column filter behavior when clearing single filter using the in-line erase button.\n- BUGFIX: #4613 Fixed per-column filter behavior when jumping between subsequent filter inputs, so it does not apply filter for each single input, but rather waits for user Enter or Return key to be hit.

The only condition is that columns are selected directly, without expression modifiers, such as math operations, etc.\n- CHANGE: Introduced support for custom number of table constraints (not column constraints), so for example two or more primary keys defined as separated table constraints is now possible from table dialog. (http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=200)\n- CHANGE: Trigger DDL support enhanced.

Nobody seems to use them. Users still can run SQLiteStudio from sources with some Tcl distribution.\n- BUGFIX: Again improved performance for huge table data and huge query results.\n- BUGFIX: Column context information in table window fixed to display constraints correctly.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed virtual table exporting (http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=201).\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=1199\n\n### 2.0.28\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=1086\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=1091\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=1128\n- BUGFIX: Fixed \"maximized\" window state, so it's correctly restored on Unixes.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed font picker dialog to use proper theming engine.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=1110\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=1115\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=977\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=1198\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=1144\n\n### 2.0.27\n- ADDED: http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=967\n- ADDED: http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=934\n- BUGFIX: Fix for white icons on disabled toolbar buttons on MacOSX.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=815\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=818\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=828\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=829\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=844\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=852\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=913\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=973\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=947\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=983\n- BUGFIX: Fixed error when completion hint was invoked for alias name that is also a proper table name.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=984\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=1029\n- BUGFIX: Fixed http://bugs.sqlitestudio.pl/?id=607\n- BUGFIX: Fixed invalid focus when clicked on \"data\" tab.

It provides many, many possibilities. Few of them are already implemented and listed in changelog below.\n- ADDED: (SQL parser stuff) SQL syntax validation on the fly with error markers.\n- ADDED: (SQL parser stuff) Enterprise SQL code formatter. It's very powerful and configurable, but works only on valid code, so if the SQL is marked to be incorrect (see paragraph above) then formatter won't format such SQL.\n- ADDED: Table columns can be edited directly from table window by double-clicking on them.\n- ADDED: Columns order in TableDialog can be now be managed by drag&drop.\n- ADDED: Possibility to display ROWID in table data view. Just right-click and pick it from context menu.\n- ADDED: Internal stuff: [final] procedure, so important internal variables are secured.\n- ADDED: Internal stuff: Introduced threads. GUI acts more shmoothly.\n- ADDED: Possibility to add database only for current session (it won't be on the list after application restart).\n- ADDED: Window/task can be renamed now from taskbar context menu.\n- ADDED: Tasks order in taskbar at the bottom can now be managed using drag&drop.\n- ADDED: Progress bar for export dialog, populate dalog and table dialog (good to keep track on tasks done on tables with lots of data) with possibility to interrupt the process.\n- ADDED: Long query executions can be interrupted.\n- ADDED: Pending commits (with autocommit as option in configuration). User can modify some data (add, edit or delete rows) and commit them all togather at the end.\n- ADDED: Filter entry in form view of table data tab.\n- ADDED: Added \"(filtered)\" information next to \"Total rows\" in case of filtered table data view.\n- ADDED: Edit trigger and edit index buttons added in table triggers and indexes tabs.\n- ADDED: \"Execute SQL from file\" button in SQL editor window.\n- ADDED: Context menu for SQL editor window.\n- ADDED: SQL functions available while managing databases in SQLiteStudio: md5(), base64_encode(), base64_decode(), file(), sha1(), hmac().\n- ADDED: \"Create similar table\" option.\n- ADDED: Quick opening of tables typed in SQL editor. Press Control key and click on table name to open it.\n- ADDED: Database integrity checking pragma added to database context menu.\n- ADDED: Full informations about installed plugins and used Tcl packages available in About dialog.\n- ADDED: Option to open items from database tree by single-click.\n- ADDED: While creating an unique index: if there are duplicates in table, then SQLiteStudio proposes to create SQL to select all duplicated rows.\n- ADDED: Button in SQL editor to create a view from query typed in the editor.\n- ADDED: Support for parameters (?, ?NNN, :VVV, @VVV, $VVV) in queries typed in SQL editor.\n- ADDED: Option to place SQL editor results below the query, not in separated tab.\n- ADDED: When holding mouse over data grid or results grid, the hint pops up with some context information about cell under mouse cursor.\n- ADDED: DDL tab in all Table/Index/Trigger/View dialog windows to see objects DDL before it's actualy created.\n- ADDED: New versions checking at startup or on demand and auto-upadte support for binary distributions.\n- ADDED: MacOS X port.\n- ADDED: Binaries for linux (ix86_64), freebsd (ix86_64) and macosx (ix86_64) platforms.\n- CHANGE: Exporting was rewritten from scratch. It was the ugliest code in whole application. Now it's based on plugins, so it's much easier to add new exporting engines.\n- CHANGE: (SQL parser stuff) Smart completion hints - now SQLiteStudio knows better if next argument should be a keyword, or a table name, or index, name, etc. Moreover - object names (tables, indexes, etc) already used somewhere in the SQL query appear higher in completion hint, since user seems to be interested in them. It really kicks ass! Try it out!\n- CHANGE: Internal stuff: 'Array' class has been completly replaced by Tcl Dicts from Tcl 8.5.\n- CHANGE: Small unification in layout of database edit dialog and convert database dialog.\n- CHANGE: Configuration settings saving enclosed in transaction - major speed improvement of this action.\n- CHANGE: Bug reporting engine completly rewritten. Know it is very simple to report a bug.\n- CHANGE: Numerous scrollbars are now shown/hidden dynamically when needed.\n- CHANGE: Query execution status field shows icon (info, warning, error) for all messages to identify type of message easier.\n- CHANGE: Results as plain text moved to separated tab.\n- CHANGE: Context menu in databases list reorganized.\n- CHANGE: Refreshing database schema doesn't collapse its branches.\n- CHANGE: Executing queries in SQL editor refreshes schema in databases tree, so all new, changed or deleted objects are noticed immediately.\n- CHANGE: Balloon hints appears now faster and allows to browse help hints for many widgets placed close to each other very quickly.\n- CHANGE: New icons.\n- CHANGE: Table window now displays all constraints in \"Columns\" tab as icons. Therefore \"constraints\" tab has been removed from table window.\n- CHANGE: More intuitive inserting data in form view.\n- CHANGE: Plain text results are now configurable (NULL representation, column width).\n- CHANGE: Pressing key Right/Left while editing cell and being on the begin/end of the edited value moves keyboard focus to cell on the left/right side.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed highlighting of comment which starts in the middle of contents with '/*' and never ends.\n- BUGFIX: Closing configuration window in other way than \"cancel\" or \"ok\" makes it close as for \"cancel\".\n- BUGFIX: (SQL parser stuff) Detecting symbolic database names (databases from objects tree) in SQL editor has been fixed, so table name same as database name won't be a problem anymore.\n- BUGFIX: (SQL parser stuff) All dialog windows for editing SQLite objets (tables, indexes, ...) use now built-in SQL parser, so they read all object definitions correctly.\n- BUGFIX: Triggers created for table are recreated after table is edited.\n- BUGFIX: File choosing dialog fixes under Unix (filters updating and <escape> key binding).\n- BUGFIX: Database adding/editing dialog under Windows unified to Unix version, so now there's only one button for file picking. No more confusion here.\n- BUGFIX: Many, many, many other bug fixes not listed here, because I didn't write them down during fixing.\n- BUGFIX: Scrolling grids horizontally is now smooth.\n- BUGFIX: Added *(*autoindex*)* indexes of SQLite2 to list of system indexes, so they can be filtered out.\n- BUGFIX: Many, many other minor and major bugfixes not mentioned here.\n\n### 1.1.3\n- ADDED: Port to FreeBSD!\n- ADDED: Support for lang/ subdirectory in starting directory, so testing new translations is now very simple.\n- ADDED: Ctrl+c shortcut now works for databases tree - you can copy label of any element from the tree.\n- ADDED: New translation: Espanol (Spanish).\n- ADDED: New translation: German.\n- CHANGE: Internal change: [foreach] replaced with [lassign] to adjust code to Tcl 8.5.\n- CHANGE: Export dialog suggests same directory for output file as exported database is in.\n- CHANGE: Tcl/Tk updated to 8.5.7, SQLite3 updated to 3.6.16, TreeCtrl updated to 2.2.9 - for binary packages.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed dialogs: About, ChangeLog and Roadmap.\n- BUGFIX: Minor fixes in messages and translations.\n- BUGFIX: Toolbar doesn't display undefined (empty) tooltips anymore.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed support of some constraints.

Huge performance gain!\n- CHANGE: Added support for img::png package as alternation to tkpng (img::png is still more popular on some platforms).\n- CHANGE: printStackTract procedure modified a little to produce more readable stack traces.\n- CHANGE: API documentation updated. More classess documented.\n- CHANGE: Shortcut edit widget takes Escape key as a way to cancel edition, instead of binding a shortcut with it.\n- CHANGE: New rows which user adds to table data appears below currently selected row, instead of end of grid.\n- CHANGE: SQL formatter externalized to plugin. Now anyone can write his own SQL formatter as plugin.\n- CHANGE: SQL errors are no longer connected with full Tcl stack trace in error/warning dialogs, so they are more readable to user.\n- BUGFIX: NULL handling fixed (for SQLite3). Note that setting NULL in SQLite2 databases works, but it cannot be read as NULL, so for NULLs in SQLite2 you'll see just empty cells.\n- BUGFIX: Exporting results of query with number of rows greater than 1000 was exporting only 1000 - the ones currently visible in results table.\n- BUGFIX: /* This kind of comments */ is now highlighted.\n- BUGFIX: Shortcut edits doesn't crash when Control key was pressed and released without any other key togather.\n- BUGFIX: ScrolledFrame fixed to fit well into parent widgets. It affects numerous Configuration Dialog tabs as well, as Form View of data, Index dialog and others.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed editing tables with name containing whitespaces.\n- BUGFIX: Font of grids is now set properly.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed indexes for columns with spaces in name.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed new index dialog when choosing target table from database with uncommon name.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed view edit dialog to support views with spaces in name.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed editing table columns with value length specified, as 'VARCHAR(10)'.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed validation of integer value for maximum results per page in data preview.\n- BUGFIX: Font dialog fixed so it looks a bit better.\n- BUGFIX: Total number of rows in table data tab updates on the fly when new rows are added or deleted.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed SQL highlighting in editor history tab.\n- BUGFIX: Setting Foreign Key for column(s) while creating new table (it worked for editing tables).\n- BUGFIX: Fixed restoring session - in some cases it wasn't restoring properly.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed creating and opening table with strange names, like '''''''''''.\n- BUGFIX: Edit widget (for non-BLOB columns) is now moved correctly when scrolling grid.\n- BUGFIX: Exporting dialog doesn't close on input error anymore and lets user to fix input.\n- BUGFIX: Add/Edit database dialog doesn't change main window title anymore.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed support for strange database names (such as abc';'efg).\n- BUGFIX: Refreshing toolbar after changing schema is now performed correctly.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed View dialog database selection.\n- BUGFIX: CSV exporting fixed in case of spearator character in cell value.\n- BUGFIX: Other minor fixes.\n\n### 1.0.1\n- CHANGE: SQLite 3 engine updated to 3.5.9 for binary distributions.\n- CHANGE: Index dialog modified to use ScrolledFrame instead of canvas, so it looks much better.\n- BUGFIX: Fixed common error \"item X column Y has no style\" that was very hard to reproduce, at last!\n- BUGFIX: Fixed running binary application with \"[\" character in its file name.\n- BUGFIX: Granted permissions to load external SQLite extensions using load_extension() SQL function.\n\n### 1.0.0\n- CHANGE: SQLiteStudio has been released on GPLv2 licence!\n- CHANGE: Removed licence-responsible code. Tbcload extension is no more required.\n\n### 1.0.0-beta6\n- CHANGE: Columns in table data view and editor results view can be resized now, but BLOB fileds still can't be loaded whole directly to grid cell (I think the reason is obvious).\n- CHANGE: There is a known bug that is not 100%-repeatable. It occurs sometimes when switching to FormView of table data.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"
