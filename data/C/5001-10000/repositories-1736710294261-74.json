By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\nLicense for //assets\n==========================================\n\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n\nCreative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does\nnot provide legal services or legal advice.

Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses,\nany material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related\ninformation. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting\nfrom their use to the fullest extent possible. Using Creative Commons Public\nLicenses Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and\nconditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original\nworks of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other\nrights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are\nfor informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of\nour licenses. Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended\nfor use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in\nways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses\nare irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions\nof the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure\nall rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse\nthe material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not\nsubject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material\nused under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for\nlicensors. Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses,\na licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under\nspecified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary\nfor any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation\nto copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant\nonly permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has\nauthority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for\nother reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the\nmaterial. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all\nchanges be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are\nencouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for\nthe public.\n\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be\nbound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public\nLicense may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights\nin consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the\nLicensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor\nreceives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and\nconditions.\n\nSection 1 – Definitions.\n\na. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights\nthat is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the\nLicensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise\nmodified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar\nRights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the\nLicensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted\nMaterial is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed\nrelation with a moving image.\n\nb. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and\nSimilar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with\nthe terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nc. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely\nrelated to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast,\nsound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the\nrights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the\nrights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nd. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence\nof proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations\nunder Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996,\nand/or similar international agreements.\n\ne. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other\nexception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your\nuse of the Licensed Material.\n\nf. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other\nmaterial to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\ng. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and\nconditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and\nSimilar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the\nLicensor has authority to license.\n\nh. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this\nPublic License.\n\ni. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that\nrequires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public\ndisplay, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or\nimportation, and to make material available to the public including in ways\nthat members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time\nindividually chosen by them.\n\nj. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting\nfrom Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11\nMarch 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded,\nas well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\nk. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under\nthis Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\nSection 2 – Scope.\n\na. License grant.\n\n1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: \n\nA. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n\nB. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. \n\n3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). \n\n4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. \n\n5. Downstream recipients. \n\nA. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the\nLicensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\nexercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public\nLicense.\n\nB. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or\ndifferent terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\nMeasures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\nLicensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). \n\nb. Other rights.\n\n1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. \n\n2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. \n\n3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. \n\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\na. Attribution.\n\n1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: \n\nA. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed\nMaterial:\n\ni. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others\ndesignated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the\nLicensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\nii. a copyright notice;\n\niii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\niv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\nv. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably\npracticable;\n\nB. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of\nany previous modifications; and\n\nC. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and\ninclude the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. \n\n3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. \n\n4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. \n\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to\nYour use of the Licensed Material:\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to\nextract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the\ncontents of the database;\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a\ndatabase in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in\nwhich You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)\nis Adapted Material; and\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a\nsubstantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace\nYour obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include\nother Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\na. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent\npossible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,\nand makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed\nMaterial, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes,\nwithout limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a\nparticular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects,\naccuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or\ndiscoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in\npart, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n\nb. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on\nany legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for\nany direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary,\nor other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public\nLicense or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised\nof the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a\nlimitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may\nnot apply to You.\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above\nshall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely\napproximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar\nRights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,\nthen Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\nb.

Its primary purpose is to act as a testbed for\nresearch in artificial intelligence, especially deep reinforcement learning.\n\n## About\n\nDisclaimer: This is not an official Google product.\n\nIf you use *DeepMind Lab* in your research and would like to cite\nthe *DeepMind Lab* environment, we suggest you cite\nthe [DeepMind Lab paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03801).\n\nYou can reach us at [lab@deepmind.com](mailto:lab@deepmind.com).\n\n## Getting started on Linux\n\n* Get [Bazel from bazel.io](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html).\n\n* Clone DeepMind Lab, e.g. by running\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/deepmind/lab\n$ cd lab\n```\n\nFor a live example of a random agent, run\n\n```shell\nlab$ bazel run :python_random_agent --define graphics=sdl -- \\\n               --length=10000 --width=640 --height=480\n```\n\nHere is some [more detailed build documentation](/docs/users/build.md),\nincluding how to install dependencies if you don't have them.\n\nTo enable compiler optimizations, pass the flag `--compilation_mode=opt`, or\n`-c opt` for short, to each `bazel build`, `bazel test` and `bazel run` command.\nThe flag is omitted from the examples here for brevity, but it should be used\nfor real training and evaluation where performance matters.\n\n### Play as a human\n\nTo test the game using human input controls, run\n\n```shell\nlab$ bazel run :game -- --level_script=tests/empty_room_test --level_setting=logToStdErr=true\n# or:\nlab$ bazel run :game -- -l tests/empty_room_test -s logToStdErr=true\n```\n\nLeave the `logToStdErr` setting off to disable most log output.\n\nThe values of observations that the environment exposes can be printed at every\nstep by adding a flag `--observation OBSERVATION_NAME` for each observation of\ninterest.\n\n```shell\nlab$ bazel run :game -- --level_script=lt_chasm --observation VEL.TRANS --observation VEL.ROT\n```\n\n### Train an agent\n\n*DeepMind Lab* ships with an example random agent in\n[`python/random_agent.py`](python/random_agent.py)\nwhich can be used as a starting point for implementing a learning agent. To let\nthis agent interact with DeepMind Lab for training, run\n\n```shell\nlab$ bazel run :python_random_agent\n```\n\nThe [Python API](/docs/users/python_api.md) is\nused for agent-environment interactions. We also provide bindings to DeepMind's\n\"[dm_env](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_env)\" general API for reinforcement\nlearning, as well as a way to build a self-contained PIP package; see the\n[separate documentation](python/pip_package/README.md)\nfor details.\n\n*DeepMind Lab* ships with [different\nlevels](/docs/levels.md) implementing different\ntasks. These tasks can be configured using Lua scripts, as described in the [Lua\nAPI](/docs/developers/reference/lua_api.md).\n\n-----------------\n\n## Upstream sources\n\n*DeepMind Lab* is built from the *ioquake3* game engine, and it uses the tools\n*q3map2* and *bspc* for map creation. Bug fixes and cleanups that originate\nwith those projects are best fixed upstream and then merged into *DeepMind Lab*.\n\n* *bspc* is taken from [github.com/TTimo/bspc](https://github.com/TTimo/bspc),\n  revision d9a372db3fb6163bc49ead41c76c801a3d14cf80. There are virtually no\n  local modifications, although we integrate this code with the main ioq3 code\n  and do not use their copy in the `deps` directory. We expect this code to be\n  stable.\n\n* *q3map2* is taken from\n  [github.com/TTimo/GtkRadiant](https://github.com/TTimo/GtkRadiant),\n  revision d3d00345c542c8d7cc74e2e8a577bdf76f79c701. A few minor local\n  modifications add synchronization. We also expect this code to be stable.\n\n* *ioquake3* is taken from\n  [github.com/ioquake/ioq3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3),\n  revision 29db64070aa0bae49953bddbedbed5e317af48ba. The code contains extensive\n  modifications and additions. We aim to merge upstream changes occasionally.\n\nWe are very grateful to the maintainers of these repositories for all their hard\nwork on maintaining high-quality code bases.\n\n## External dependencies, prerequisites and porting notes\n\n*DeepMind Lab* currently ships as source code only. It depends on a few external\nsoftware libraries, which we ship in several different ways:\n\n * The `zlib`, `glib`, `libxml2`, `jpeg` and `png` libraries are referenced as\n   external Bazel sources, and Bazel BUILD files are provided. The dependent\n   code itself should be fairly portable, but the BUILD rules we ship are\n   specific to Linux on x86. To build on a different platform you will most\n   likely have to edit those BUILD files.\n\n * Message digest algorithms are included in this package (in\n   [`//third_party/md`](third_party/md)), taken from the reference\n   implementations of their respective RFCs. A \"generic reinforcement learning\n   API\" is included in [`//third_party/rl_api`](third_party/rl_api), which has\n   also been created by the *DeepMind Lab* authors. This code is portable.\n\n * EGL headers are included in this package (in\n   `//third_party/GL/{`[`EGL`](third_party/GL/EGL)`,`[`KHR`](third_party/GL/KHR)`}`),\n   taken from the Khronos OpenGL/OpenGL ES XML API Registry at\n   [www.khronos.org/registry/EGL](http://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/). The\n   headers have been modified slightly to remove the dependency of EGL on X.\n\n * Several additional libraries are required but are not shipped in any form;\n   they must be present on your system:\n   * SDL 2\n   * gettext (required by `glib`)\n   * OpenGL: A hardware driver and library are needed for hardware-accelerated\n     human play. The headless library that machine learning agents will want to\n     use can use either hardware-accelerated rendering via EGL or GLX or\n     software rendering via OSMesa, depending on the `--define headless=...`\n     build setting.\n   * Python 2.7 (other versions might work, too) with NumPy, PIL (a few tests\n     require a NumPy version of at least 1.8), or Python 3 (at least 3.5) with\n     NumPy and Pillow.\n\nThe build rules are using a few compiler settings that are specific to GCC. If\nsome flags are not recognized by your compiler (typically those would be\nspecific warning suppressions), you may have to edit those flags. The warnings\nshould be noisy but harmless.\n"

The EnvCApi functions `fps` and `act` have been removed. See previous\n    release notes for migration details.\n3.  A conformance test suite has been added to EnvCApi which exercises the\n    specified interface functions and detects some basic errors.\n\n## release-2020-12-07 December 2020 release\n\n### New Levels:\n\n1.  Psychlab.\n\n    1. contributed/psychlab/memory_suite_01/explore_goal_locations_extrapolate\n    2. contributed/psychlab/memory_suite_01/explore_goal_locations_holdout_extrapolate\n    3. contributed/psychlab/memory_suite_01/explore_goal_locations_holdout_interpolate\n    4. contributed/psychlab/memory_suite_01/explore_goal_locations_holdout_large\n    5. contributed/psychlab/memory_suite_01/explore_goal_locations_holdout_small\n    6. contributed/psychlab/memory_suite_01/explore_goal_locations_interpolate\n    7. contributed/psychlab/memory_suite_01/explore_goal_locations_train_large\n    8. contributed/psychlab/memory_suite_01/explore_goal_locations_train_small\n\n2.  Language binding tasks.\n\n    1. contributed/fast_mapping/fast_mapping\n    2. contributed/fast_mapping/slow_mapping\n\n### New Features:\n\n1.  A property system has been added that allows dynamic querying and modifying\n    of environment state. Level scripts can register and consume custom\n    properties.\n2.  A new Python module, `dmenv_module`, is provided that exposes the DeepMind\n    [`dm_env` API](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_env).\n\n### Minor Improvements:\n\n1.  Quake console commands can now be issued via a write-only property.\n2.  New numeric \"accumulate\" operations for TensorView and the Lua Tensor types:\n    sum, product, sum-of-squares, and dot product of two tensors.\n\n### EnvCApi Changes:\n\n1.  \"Properties\" have been added to the EnvCApi. Properties may be queried, set,\n    and enumerated.\n2.  The new API version is 1.4 (up from 1.3).\n3.  The EnvCApi function `fps` is now deprecated; environments should instead\n    use the new property system to communicate this information.\n\n### Bug Fixes:\n\n1.  Fix observation 'VEL.ROT' to allow non-zero values when combined with pixel\n    observations. Previously, the presence of pixel observations caused the\n    angular velocity information to be lost due to a logic error.\n\n## release-2019-10-07 October 2019 release\n\n### New Levels:\n\n1.

The `game` demo executable can now print observations at each step.\n\n### EnvCApi Changes:\n\n1.  The meaning of major and minor versions and the resulting notions of\n    stability are clarified. The new API version is 1.3 (up from 1.2).\n2.  The EnvCApi `act` function is now deprecated in favour of two finer-grained\n    functions: A call to `act` should be replaced by a call `act_discrete` to\n    set discrete actions, followed by an optional call to `act_continuous` to\n    set continuous actions. (DeepMind Lab does not use continuous actions.)\n3.  New support for \"text actions\", which can be set with the new `act_text` API\n    function. (DeepMind Lab does not use text actions.)\n\n### Bug Fixes:\n\n1.  Observation 'DEBUG.CAMERA_INTERLEAVED.TOP_DOWN' is now correct for levels\n    `dmlab30/explore_object_rewards_{few,many}`.\n\n    An error is now raised if there is not enough space to place every possible\n    room (regardless of whether the random generation _actually_ produces a room\n    of excessive size) and if a non-zero number of rooms was requested.\n\n    The affected levels have been updated and will generate layouts similar to\n    before, but the whole maze is offset by 100 units, and object placements\n    will change.\n2.  Fix top-down camera for language levels.\n3.  Correct typo in bot `Leonis`, skill level 1, based on OpenArena's bot code\n    `gargoyle_c.c`.\n4.  Tensor scalar operations using arrays now work similar to the way they do\n    with single values.\n\n## release-2019-02-04 February 2019 release\n\n### New Levels:\n\n1.  Psychlab.\n\n    1. contributed/psychlab/harlow\n\n### Minor Improvements:\n\n1.  Improve documentation of how to configure non-hermetic dependencies (Lua,\n    Python, NumPy).\n2.  Add 'allowHoldOutLevels' setting to allow running of levels that should not\n    be trained on, but held out for evaluation.\n3.  Add logging library 'common.log', which provides the ability to control\n    which log messages are emitted via the setting 'logLevel'.\n4.  Update the ioq3 upstream code to the [latest\n    state](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3/tree/29db64070aa0bae49953bddbedbed5e317af48ba).\n5.  Lua 5.1 is now downloaded and built from source, and is thus no longer a\n    required local dependency.\n6.  A minimal version of the \"realpath\" utility is now bundled with the code,\n    and thus \"realpath\" is no longer a required local dependency.\n\n### Bug Fixes:\n\n1.  Prevent missing sounds from causing clients to disconnect.\n2.  Fix a bug in the call of the theme callback 'placeFloorModels', which had\n    caused an \"'index' is missing\" error during compilation of text levels with\n    texture sets that use floor models, such as MINESWEEPER, GO, and PACMAN.\n3.  Fix bug where levels 'keys_doors_medium', 'keys_doors_random' and\n    'rooms_keys_doors_puzzle' would not accept the common 'logLevel' setting.\n4.  Expose a 'demofiles' command line flag for the Python random agent, without\n    which the agent was not able to record or play back demos.\n5.  Fix a memory deallocation order error introduced by [an earlier\n    commit](https://github.com/deepmind/lab/commit/467f2de3a5c495e0c879023b73fe9ed2a86bc69c).\n\n## release-2018-06-20 June 2018 release\n\n### New Levels:\n\n1.  Psychlab.\n\n    1. contributed/psychlab/glass_pattern_detection\n    2. contributed/psychlab/landoltC_identification\n    3. contributed/psychlab/motion_discrimination{,_easy}\n    4. contributed/psychlab/multiple_object_tracking{,_easy}\n    5. contributed/psychlab/odd_one_out\n\n### Bug Fixes:\n\n1.  Let Python level cache set to `None` mean the same as not setting it at all.\n2.  Change Python module initialization in Python-3 mode to make PIP packages\n    work in Python 3.\n\n### Minor Improvements:\n\n1.  Add support for absl::variant to lua::Push and lua::Read.\n2.  The demo `:game` has a new flag `--start_index` to start at an episode index\n    other than 0.\n3.  Add a console command `dm_pickup` to pick up an item identified by its `id`.\n4.  More Python demos and tests now work with Python 3.\n5.  Add a shader for rendering decals with transparency.\n\n## release-2018-05-15 May 2018 release\n\n### New Levels:\n\n1.  DMLab-30.\n\n    1.   contributed/dmlab30/psychlab_arbitrary_visuomotor_mapping\n    2.   contributed/dmlab30/psychlab_continuous_recognition\n\n2.  Psychlab.\n\n    1.   contributed/psychlab/arbitrary_visuomotor_mapping\n    2.   contributed/psychlab/continuous_recognition\n\n### New Features:\n\n1.  Support for level caching for improved performance in the Python module.\n2.  Add the ability to spawn pickups dynamically at arbitrary locations.\n3.  Add implementations to read datasets including Cifar10 and Stimuli.\n4.  Add the ability to specify custom actions via 'customDiscreteActionSpec' and\n    'customDiscreteAction' callbacks.\n\n### Bug Fixes:\n\n1.  Fix playerId and otherPlayerId out by one errors in 'game_rewards.lua'.\n2.  Require playerId passed to `game:addScore` to be one indexed instead of zero\n    indexed and allow `game:addScore` to be used without a playerId.\n3.  `game:renderCustomView` now renders the view with top-left as the origin.\n    The previous behaviour can be achieved by calling reverse(1) on the returned\n    tensor.\n4.  Fix a bug in image.scale whereby the offset into the data was erroneously\n    ignored.\n5.  Fix a typo in a `require` statement in visual_search_factory.lua.\n6.  Fix a few erroneous dependencies on Lua dictionary iteration order.\n7.  `game:AddScore` now works even on the final frame of an episode.\n\n### Minor Improvements:\n\n1.  Moved .map files into assets/maps/src and .bsp files into assets/maps/built.\n    Added further pre-built maps, which removes the need for the expensive\n    :map_assets build step.\n2.  Allow game to be rendered with top-left as origin instead of bottom-left.\n3.  Add 'mixerSeed' setting to change behaviour of all random number generators.\n4.  Support for BGR_INTERLEAVED and BGRD_INTERLEAVED observation formats.\n5.  Add a Lua API to load PNGs from file contents.\n6.  Add 'eyePos' to playerInfo() for a more accurate eye position of player.\n    Used in place of player pos + height.\n7.  Add support for absl::string_view to lua::Push and lua::Read.\n8.  Allow player model to be overridden via 'playerModel' callback.\n9.  Add ability to specify custom actions via 'customDiscreteActionSpec' and\n    'customDiscreteAction' callbacks.\n10. Add `game:console` command to issue Quake 3 console commands directly.\n11. Add `clamp` to tensor operations.\n12. Add new callback `api:newClientInfo`, allowing each client to intercept\n    when players are loading.\n13. Skymaze level generation is now restricted to produce only 100000 distinct\n    levels. This allows for caching to avoid expensive recompilations.\n14. Add cvars 'cg_drawScriptRectanglesAlways' and 'cg_drawScriptTextAlways' to\n    enable script rendering when reducedUI or minimalUI is enabled.\n15. All pickup types can now choose their movement type separately, and in\n    particular, all pickup types can be made static. Two separate table entries\n    are now specified for an item, 'typeTag' and 'moveType'.\n\n### Deprecated Features:\n\n1.  Observation format names `RGB_INTERLEAVED` and `RGBD_INTERLEAVED` replace\n    `RGB_INTERLACED` and `RGBD_INTERLACED`, respectively. The old format names\n    are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n2.  The pickup item's `tag` member is now called `moveType`. The old name is\n    deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n\n## release-2018-02-07 February 2018 release\n\n### New Levels:\n\n1.

Basic support for demo recording and playback.\n\n### Minor Improvements:\n\n1.  Add a mechanism to build DeepMind Lab as a PIP package.\n2.  Extend basic testing to all levels under game_scripts/levels.\n3.  Add settings `minimalUI` and `reducedUI` to avoid rendering parts of the\n    HUD.\n4.  Add `teleported` flag to `game:playerInfo()` to tell whether a player has\n    teleported that frame.\n5.  Add Lua functions `countEntities` and `countVariations` to the maze\n    generation API to count the number of occurrences of a specific entity or\n    variation, respectively.\n6.  Add ability to switch/select gadget via actions. Actions are available when\n    enabling flags `gadgetSelect` and/or `gadgetSwitch`.\n\n### Bug Fixes:\n\n1.  Fix out-of-bounds access in Lua 'image' library.\n2.  Fix off-by-one error in renderergl1 grid mesh rendering.\n\n## release-2018-01-26 January 2018 release\n\n### New Levels:\n\n1.  Psychlab, a platform for implementing classical experimental paradigms from\n    cognitive psychology.\n\n    1.  contributed/psychlab/sequential_comparison\n    2.  contributed/psychlab/visual_search\n\n### New Features:\n\n1.  Extend functionality of the built-in `tensor` Lua library.\n2.  Add built-in `image` Lua library for loading and scaling PNGs.\n3.  Add error handling to the env_c_api (version 1.1).\n4.  Add ability to create events from Lua scripts.\n5.  Add ability to retrieve game entity from Lua scripts.\n6.  Add ability create pickup models during level load.\n7.  Add ability to update textures from script after the level has loaded.\n8.  Add Lua customisable themes. Note: This change renames helpers in\n    `maze_generation` to be in lowerCamelCase (e.g. `MazeGeneration` ->\n    `mazeGeneration`).\n9.  The directory `game_scripts` has moved out of the `assets` directory, and\n    level scripts now live separately from the library code in the `levels`\n    subdirectory.\n\n### Minor Improvements:\n\n1.  Remove unnecessary dependency of map assets on Lua scripts, preventing\n    time-consuming rebuilding of maps when scripts are modified.\n2.  Add ability to disable bobbing of reward and goal pickups.\n3.  The setting `controls` (with values `internal`, `external`) has been renamed\n    to `nativeApp` (with values `true`, `false`, respectively). When set to\n    `true`, programs linked against `game_lib_sdl` will use the native SDL input\n    devices.\n4.  Change LuaSnippetEmitter methods to use table call conventions.\n5.  Add config variable for monochromatic lightmaps ('r_monolightmaps'). Enabled\n    by default.\n6.  Add config variable to limit texture size ('r_textureMaxSize').\n7.  api:modifyTexture must now return whether the texture was modified.\n8.  Add ability to adjust rewards.\n9.  Add ability to raycast between different points on the map.\n10. Add ability to test whether a view vector is within an angle range within a\n    oriented view frame.\n\n### Bug Fixes:\n\n1.  Increase current score storage from short to long.\n2.  Fix ramp jump velocity in level lt_space_bounce_hard.\n3.  Fix Lua function 'addScore' from module 'dmlab.system.game' to allow\n    negative scores added to a player.\n4.  Remove some undefined behaviour in the engine.\n5.  Reduce inaccuracies related to angle conversion and normalization.\n6.  Behavior of team spawn points now matches that of player spawn points.\n    'randomAngleRange' spawnVar must be set to 0 to match previous behavior.\n\n## release-2016-12-06 Initial release\n"
