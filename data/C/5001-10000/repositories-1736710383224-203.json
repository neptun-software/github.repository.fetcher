Based on DPDK, dperf can generate huge traffic with a single x86 server: tens of millions of HTTP CPS，hundreds of Gbps throughput and billions of concurrent connections.\n- Detailed statistics：\n  - Provides detailed statistics and identify every packet loss.\n- Support multiple scenarios：\n  - Load testing and stability testing for Layer 4 Load Balancer and other Layer 4 gateways.\n  - Network  performance testing for servers on cloud.\n  - Performance test of network package processing capability for NIC and CPU.\n  - Can be used as a high performance HTTP server or client for load testing.\n\n## Performance\n### HTTP Connections per Second\n|Client Cores|Server Cores|HTTP CPS|\n|------------|------------|--------|\n|1|1|2,101,044|\n|2|2|4,000,423|\n|4|4|7,010,743|\n|6|6|10,027,172|\n\n### HTTP Throughput per Second\n|Client Cores|Server Cores|RX(Gbps)|TX(Gbps)|Client CPU Usage(%)|Server CPU Usage(%)|\n|------------|------------|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|1|1|18|18|60|59|\n|2|2|35|35|60|59|\n|4|4|46|46|43|43|\n\n### HTTP Current Connections\n|Client Cores|Server Cores|Current Connections|Client CPU Usage(%)|Server CPU Usage(%)|\n|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|1|1|100,000,000|34|39|\n|2|2|200,000,000|36|39|\n|4|4|400,000,000|40|41|\n\n### UDP TX PPS\n|Client Cores|TX MPPS|Client CPU Usage(%)|\n|------------|-------|-------------------|\n|1|15.96|95|\n|2|29.95|95|\n|4|34.92|67|\n|6|35.92|54|\n|8|37.12|22|\n\nNote: this test is under one 25Gbps Mellanox CX4\n\n### Client & Server Configuration\nAbove performance is obtained with below configurations:\n\n- MEM: 512GB(hugepage 100GB)\n- NIC: Mellanox MT27710 25Gbps * 2\n- Kernel: 4.19.90\n\n## Statistics\ndperf outputs various statistics every second：\n- TPS, CPS, various PPS\n- Errors of TCP/Socket/HTTP\n- Packets loss/drop\n- Retransmissions of TCP Flags\n\n```\nseconds 22                 cpuUsage 52\npktRx   3,001,058          pktTx    3,001,025          bitsRx   2,272,799,040      bitsTx  1,920,657,600      dropTx  0\narpRx   0                  arpTx    0                  icmpRx   0                  icmpTx  0                  otherRx 0          badRx 0\nsynRx   1,000,345          synTx    1,000,330          finRx    1,000,350          finTx   1,000,350          rstRx   0          rstTx 0\nsynRt   0                  finRt    0                  ackRt    0                  pushRt  0                  tcpDrop 0\nskOpen  1,000,330          skClose  1,000,363          skCon    230                skErr   0\nhttpGet 1,000,345          http2XX  1,000,350          httpErr  0\nierrors 0                  oerrors  0                  imissed  0\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n### Set hugepages\n    #edit '/boot/grub2/grub.cfg' like this, and reboot the OS\n    linux16 /vmlinuz-... nopku transparent_hugepage=never default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=8\n\n### Build DPDK\n    #edit 'config/common_base' to enable PMDs\n    #Mellanox CX4/CX5 requires 'CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_MLX5_PMD=y'\n    #HNS3 requires 'CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_HNS3_PMD=y'\n    #VMXNET3 requires 'CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_VMXNET3_PMD=y'\n\n    TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc #or arm64-armv8a-linuxapp-gcc\n\n    cd /root/dpdk/dpdk-stable-19.11.10\n    make install T=$TARGET -j16\n\n### Build dperf\n    cd dperf\n    make -j8 RTE_SDK=/root/dpdk/dpdk-stable-19.11.10 RTE_TARGET=$TARGET\n\n### Bind interface\n    #Mellanox NIC skip this step!\n    #Suppose your PCI number is 0000:1b:00.0\n\n    modprobe uio\n    modprobe uio_pci_generic\n    /root/dpdk/dpdk-stable-19.11.10/usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b uio_pci_generic 0000:1b:00.0\n\n### Start dperf server\n    #dperf server bind at 6.6.241.27:80,  gateway is 6.6.241.1\n    ./build/dperf -c test/http/server-cps.conf\n\n### Send request from a client\n    #the client IP must be in the range of 'client' in the configuration file\n    ping 6.6.241.27\n    curl http://6.6.241.27/\n\n## Running the tests\nBelow example will start a HTTP CPS stress test.\n\n    #run dperf server\n    ./build/dperf -c test/http/server-cps.conf\n\n    #from another host, run dperf client\n    ./build/dperf -c test/http/client-cps.conf\n\n## Documentation\nSee the website at [https://dperf.org/](https://dperf.org/).\n\n## Limitation\n - dperf requires that the HTTP message is in one packet, which is not suitable for the test of layer 7 load balancer.\n - dperf requires exclusive use of the network interfaces.\n - dperf does not have routing capability.
