          "content": "Installation Instructions\n*************************\n\nCopyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005 Free\nSoftware Foundation, Inc.\n\nThis file is free documentation; the Free Software Foundation gives\nunlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.\n\nBasic Installation\n==================\n\nThese are generic installation instructions.\n\n   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for\nvarious system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses\nthose values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.\nIt may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent\ndefinitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that\nyou can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a\nfile `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for\ndebugging `configure').\n\n   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'\nand enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves\nthe results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  (Caching is\ndisabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale\ncache files.)\n\n   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try\nto figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail\ndiffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can\nbe considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at\nsome point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you\nmay remove or edit it.\n\n   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create\n`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You only need\n`configure.ac' if you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using\na newer version of `autoconf'.\n\nThe simplest way to compile this package is:\n\n  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type\n     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're\n     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type\n     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute\n     `configure' itself.\n\n     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some\n     messages telling which features it is checking for.\n\n  2. Type `make' to compile the package.\n\n  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with\n     the package.\n\n  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and\n     documentation.\n\n  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the\n     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the\n     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for\n     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is\n     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly\n     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get\n     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came\n     with the distribution.\n\nCompilers and Options\n=====================\n\nSome systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the\n`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for\ndetails on some of the pertinent environment variables.\n\n   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters\nby setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here\nis an example:\n\n     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix\n\n   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.\n\nCompiling For Multiple Architectures\n====================================\n\nYou can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the\nsame time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their\nown directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that\nsupports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the\ndirectory where you want the object files and executables to go and run\nthe `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the\nsource code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.\n\n   If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'\nvariable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a\ntime in the source code directory.  After you have installed the\npackage for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring\nfor another architecture.\n\nInstallation Names\n==================\n\nBy default, `make install' installs the package's commands under\n`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You\ncan specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving\n`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.\n\n   You can specify separate installation prefixes for\narchitecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you\npass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses\nPREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.\nDocumentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.\n\n   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give\noptions like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular\nkinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories\nyou can set and what kinds of files go in them.\n\n   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed\nwith an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the\noption `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.\n\nOptional Features\n=================\n\nSome packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to\n`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.\nThey may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE\nis something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The\n`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the\npackage recognizes.\n\n   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually\nfind the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,\nyou can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and\n`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.\n\nSpecifying the System Type\n==========================\n\nThere may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,\nbut needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.\nUsually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_\narchitectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a\nmessage saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the\n`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system\ntype, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:\n\n     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM\n\nwhere SYSTEM can have one of these forms:\n\n     OS KERNEL-OS\n\n   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If\n`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't\nneed to know the machine type.\n\n   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should\nuse the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will\nproduce code for.\n\n   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a\nplatform different from the build platform, you should specify the\n\"host\" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will\neventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.\n\nSharing Defaults\n================\n\nIf you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you\ncan create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default\nvalues for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.\n`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then\n`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the\n`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.\nA warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.\n\nDefining Variables\n==================\n\nVariables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the\nenvironment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run\nconfigure again during the build, and the customized values of these\nvariables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set\nthem in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:\n\n     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc\n\ncauses the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is\noverridden in the site shell script).  Here is a another example:\n\n     /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash\n\nHere the `CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash' operand causes subsequent\nconfiguration-related scripts to be executed by `/bin/bash'.\n\n`configure' Invocation\n======================\n\n`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.\n\n`--help'\n`-h'\n     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.\n\n`--version'\n`-V'\n     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'\n     script, and exit.\n\n`--cache-file=FILE'\n     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,\n     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to\n     disable caching.\n\n`--config-cache'\n`-C'\n     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.\n\n`--quiet'\n`--silent'\n`-q'\n     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To\n     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error\n     messages will still be shown).\n\n`--srcdir=DIR'\n     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually\n     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.\n\n`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run\n`configure --help' for more details.\n\n"

          "content": "iperf3:  A TCP, UDP, and SCTP network bandwidth measurement tool\n================================================================\n\nSummary\n-------\n\niperf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable\nbandwidth on IP networks.  It supports tuning of various parameters\nrelated to timing, protocols, and buffers.  For each test it reports\nthe measured throughput / bitrate, loss, and other parameters.\n\nThis version, sometimes referred to as iperf3, is a redesign of an\noriginal version developed at NLANR/DAST.  iperf3 is a new\nimplementation from scratch, with the goal of a smaller, simpler code\nbase, and a library version of the functionality that can be used in\nother programs. iperf3 also has a number of features found in other tools\nsuch as nuttcp and netperf, but were missing from the original iperf.\nThese include, for example, a zero-copy mode and optional JSON output.\nNote that iperf3 is *not* backwards compatible with the original iperf.\n\nPrimary development for iperf3 takes place on Ubuntu Linux, FreeBSD,\nand macOS.  At this time, these are the only officially supported\nplatforms, however there have been some reports of success with\nOpenBSD, NetBSD, Android, Solaris, and other Linux distributions.\n\niperf3 is principally developed by ESnet / Lawrence Berkeley National\nLaboratory.  It is released under a three-clause BSD license.\n\nFor more information see: https://software.es.net/iperf\n\nSource code and issue tracker: https://github.com/esnet/iperf\n\nDiscussion forums: https://github.com/esnet/iperf/discussions\n\nReporting security vulnerabilities: iperf@es.net\n\nObtaining iperf3\n----------------\n\nDownloads of iperf3 are available at:\n\n    https://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/\n\nTo check out the most recent code, clone the git repository at:\n\n    https://github.com/esnet/iperf.git\n\nBuilding iperf3\n---------------\n\n### Prerequisites: ###\n\nNone.\n\n### Building ###\n\n    ./configure; make; make install\n\n(Note: If configure fails, try running `./bootstrap.sh` first)\n\nInvoking iperf3\n---------------\n\niperf3 includes a manual page listing all of the command-line options.\nThe manual page is the most up-to-date reference to the various flags and parameters.\n\nFor sample command line usage, see:\n\nhttps://fasterdata.es.net/performance-testing/network-troubleshooting-tools/iperf/\n\nUsing the default options, iperf is meant to show typical well\ndesigned application performance.  \"Typical well designed application\"\nmeans avoiding artificial enhancements that work only for testing\n(such as splice()'ing the data to /dev/null).  iperf does also have\nflags for \"extreme best case\" optimizations, but they must be\nexplicitly activated.\n\nThese flags include:\n\n    -Z, --zerocopy            use a 'zero copy' sendfile() method of sending data\n    -A, --affinity n/n,m      set CPU affinity\n\nBug and Security Reports\n------------------------\n\nBefore submitting a bug report, please make sure you're running the\nlatest version of the code, and confirm that your issue has not\nalready been fixed.  Then submit to the iperf3 issue tracker on\nGitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues\n\nIn your issue submission, please indicate the version of iperf3 and\nwhat platform you're trying to run on (provide the platform\ninformation even if you're not using a supported platform, we\n*might* be able to help anyway).  Exact command-line arguments will\nhelp us recreate your problem.  If you're getting error messages,\nplease include them verbatim if possible, but remember to sanitize any\nsensitive information.\n\nIf you have a question about usage or about the code, please do *not*\nsubmit an issue.  Please use one of the mailing lists for that.\n\nIf you suspect there is a potential security issue, please contact the\ndevelopers at:\n\niperf@es.net\n\nRelation to iperf 2.x\n---------------------\n\nAlthough iperf2 and iperf3 both measure network performance,\nthey are not compatible with each other.\nThe projects (as of mid-2021) are in active, but separate, development.\nThe continuing iperf2 development\nproject can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf2/.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nA set of known issues is maintained on the iperf3 Web pages:\n\nhttps://software.es.net/iperf/dev.html#known-issues\n\nLinks\n-----\n\nThis section lists links to user-contributed Web pages regarding\niperf3.

          "content": "iperf3 Release Notes\n====================\n\niperf-3.18 2024-12-13\n---------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n    * SECURITY NOTE: Thanks to Leonid Krolle Bi.Zone for discovering a\n                     JSON type security vulnerability that caused a\n                     segmentation fault in the\n                     server. (CVE-2024-53580) This has now been\n                     fixed. (PR#1810)\n\n    * UDP packets per second now reports the correct number of\n      packets, by reporting NET_SOFTERROR if there's a EAGAIN/EINTR\n      errno if no data was sent (#1367/PR#1379).\n\n    * Several segmentation faults related to threading were fixed. One\n      where `pthread_cancel` was called on an improperly initialized\n      thread (#1801), another where threads were being recycled\n      (#1760/PR#1761), and another where threads were improperly\n      handling signals (#1750/PR#1752).\n\n    * A segmentation fault from calling `freeaddrinfo` with `NULL` was\n      fixed (PR#1755).\n\n    * Some JSON options were fixed, including checking the size for\n      `json_read` (PR#1709), but the size limit was removed for\n      received server output (PR#1779).\n\n    * A rcv-timeout error has been fixed. The Nread timeout was\n      hardcoded and timed out before the `--rcv-timeout` option\n      (PR#1744).\n\n    * There is no longer a limit on the omit time period\n      (#1770/PR#1774).\n\n    * Fixed an output crash under 32-bit big-endian systems (PR#1713).\n\n    * An issue was fixed where CPU utilization was unexpectedly high\n      during limited baud rate tests. The `--pacing-timer` option was\n      removed, but it is still available in the library\n      (#1741/PR#1743).\n\n    * Add SCTP information to `--json` output and fixed compile error\n      when SCTP is not supported (#1731).\n\n    * `--fq-rate` was changed from a uint to a uint64 to allow pacing above\n      32G.  Not yet tested on big-endian systems (PR#1728).\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\n    * Clang compilation failure on Android were fixed (PR#1687).\n\n    * `iperf_time_add()` was optimizated to improve performance\n      (PR#1742).\n\n    * Debug messages were added when the state changes (PR#1734).\n\n    * To increase performance, the old UDP `prot_listener` is cleared\n      and removed after each test (PR#1708).\n\n    * A file descriptor leak was closed (PR#1619).\n\niperf-3.17.1 2024-05-13\n-----------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * Version number has been corrected. (#1699)\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\n  * No longer signing tags\n\niperf-3.17 2024-05-10\n---------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * BREAKING CHANGE: iperf3's authentication features, when used with\n    OpenSSL prior to 3.2.0, contain a vulnerability to a side-channel\n    timing attack. To address this flaw, a change has been made to the\n    padding applied to encrypted strings. This change is not backwards\n    compatible with older versions of iperf3 (before 3.17). To restore\n    the older (vulnerable) behavior, and hence\n    backwards-compatibility, use the --use-pkcs1-padding flag. The\n    iperf3 team thanks Hubert Kario from RedHat for reporting this\n    issue and providing feedback on the fix. (CVE-2024-26306)(PR#1695)\n\n  * iperf3 no longer changes its current working directory in --daemon\n    mode. This results in more predictable behavior with relative\n    paths, in particular finding key and credential files for\n    authentication. (PR#1672)\n\n  * A new --json-stream option has been added to enable a streaming\n    output format, consisting of a series of JSON objects (for the\n    start of the test, each measurement interval, and the end of the\n    test) separated by newlines (#444, #923, #1098).\n\n  * UDP tests now work correctly between different endian hosts\n    (#1415).\n\n  * The --fq-rate parameter now works for --reverse tests (#1632, PR#1667).\n\n  * The statistics reporting interval is now available in the --json\n    start test object (#1663).\n\n  * A negative time test duration is now properly flagged as an error\n    (IS#1662 / PR#1666).\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\n  * Fixes have been made to better (unofficially) support builds on\n    Android (#1641 / #1651) and VxWorks (#1595).\n\n  * iperf3 now builds correctly on architectures without native\n    support for 64-bit atomic types, by linking with the libatomic\n    library (#1611).\n\niperf-3.16 2023-11-30\n---------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * Multiple test streams started with -P/--parallel will now be\n    serviced by different threads. This allows iperf3 to take\n    advantage of multiple CPU cores on modern processors, and will\n    generally result in significant throughput increases (PR #1591).\n\n  * OpenSSL 3 is now detected at build time. If OpenSSL 3 is found,\n    various older, deprecated, APIs will not be used. iperf3 will\n    continue to work with OpenSSL 1.1.1. OpenSSL is used as a part\n    of the iperf3 authentication functionality (Issue #1300, PR\n    #1589).\n    \n  * The authorized users file used by the authentication functionality\n    is now checked for accessibility much earlier during the program\n    startup, as opposed to being checked near the start of a\n    test (Issue #1583, PR #1585).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * BREAKING CHANGE: iperf3 now requires pthreads and C atomic\n    variables to compile and run.\n\niperf-3.15 2023-09-14\n---------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * Several bugs that could allow the iperf3 server to hang waiting\n    for input on the control connection has been fixed. ESnet thanks\n    Jorge Sancho Larraz from Canonical for reporting this issue. For\n    more information, see:\n    https://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/esnet-secadv-2023-0002.txt.asc\n\n  * A bug that caused garbled output with UDP tests on 32-bit hosts\n    has been fixed (PR #1554, PR #1556). This bug was introduced in\n    iperf-3.14.\n\n  * A bug in counting UDP messages has been fixed (PR #1367, PR\n    #1380).\n\niperf-3.14 2023-07-07\n---------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * A memory allocation hazard was fixed (Issue #1542/PR #1543). For\n    more information see:\n    https://downloads.es.net/pub/iperf/esnet-secadv-2023-0001.txt.asc\n\n  * JSON output was improved, such as print JSON numbers as signed (PR\n    #1539, Issue #1435), the exit code when doing JSON output was\n    fixed (PR #1523), and client_api was fixed so that it still\n    returns an error code when JSON is enabled (Issue #1405).  Also,\n    duplicate fields when using multiple streams was removed from the\n    JSON output (#1492).\n\n  * Prevent UDP packet count and operations overflow (PR #1536/Issue\n    #1534).\n\n  * Statistics are fixed when --omit is used (Issue #1489/PR #1498).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * CI builds and tests using GitHub actions have been added (PR\n    #1519).\n\n  * A fix for Android \"unable to create a new stream error\" was added\n    (PR #1506).\n\n  * Support for Voice Admit DSCP code point from RFC 5865 was added\n    (PR #1490).\n\n  * A fix for preventing a crash when RSA public key path doesn't\n    exist was fixed (PR #1488/Issue #1471).\n\niperf-3.13 2023-02-16\n---------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * fq-rate (PR #1461, Issue #1366), and bidirectional flag (Issue #1428,\n    PR #1429) were added to the JSON output.\n\n  * Added support for OpenBSD including cleaning up endian handling (PR #1396)\n    and support for TCP_INFO on systems where it was implemented (PR #1397).\n\n  * Fixed bug in how TOS is set in mapped v4 (PR #1427).\n\n  * Corrected documentation, such as updating binary download links and text\n    (Issue #1459), updating version on iperf3 websites, and fixing an\n    incorrect error message (Issue #1441).\n\n  * Fixed crash on rcv-timeout with JSON logfile (#1463, #1460, issue #1360,\n    PR #1369).\n\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented TOS/DSCP from getting set correctly for reverse\n    tests (PR #1427, Issue #638).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * Getter and setter are now available for bind_dev (PR #1419).\n\n  * Added missing getter for bidirectional tests (PR #1453).\n\n  * Added minor changes to clean up .gitignore and error messages (#1408).\n\n  * Made sure configure scripts are runnable with /bin/sh (PR #1398).\n\n  * Cleaned up RPM spec, such as adding missing RPM build dependencies, dropping\n    EL5 and removing outdated %changelog (PR #1401) to make.\n\n  * Added a fix for a resource leak bug in function iperf_create_pidfile(#1443).\n\n\niperf-3.12 2022-09-30\n---------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * cJSON has been updated to version 1.7.15 (#1383).\n\n  * The --bind <host>%<dev> option syntax now works properly (#1360 /\n    #1371).\n\n  * A server-side file descriptor leak with the --logfile option has\n    been fixed (#1369 / #1360 / #1369 / #1389 / #1393).\n\n  * A bug that caused some large values from TCP_INFO to be misprinted\n    as negative numbers has been fixed (#1372).\n\n  * Using the -k or -n flags with --reverse no longer leak into future\n    tests (#1363 / #1364).\n\n  * There are now various debug level options available with the\n    --debug option. These can be used to adjust the amount of\n    debugging output (#1327).\n\n  * A new --snd-timeout option has been added to set a termination\n    timeout for idle TCP connections (#1215 / #1282).\n\n  * iperf3 is slightly more robust to out-of-order packets during UDP\n    connection setup in --reverse mode (#914 / #1123 / #1182 / #1212 /\n    #1260).\n\n  * iperf3 will now use different ports for each direction when the\n    --cport and --bdir options are set (#1249 / #1259).\n\n  * The iperf3 server will now exit if it can't open its log file\n    (#1225 / #1251).\n\n  * Various help message and output fixes have been made (#1299 /\n    #1330 / #1345 / #1350).\n\n  * Various compiler warnings have been fixed (#1211 / #1316).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * Operation of bootstrap.sh has been fixed and simplified (#1335 /\n    #1325).\n    \n  * Flow label support / compatibility under Linux has been improved\n    (#1310).\n    \n  * Various minor memory leaks have been fixed (#1332 / #1333).\n\n  * A getter/setter has been added for the bind_port parameter\n    (--cport option). (#1303, #1305)\n\n  * Various internal documentation improvements (#1265 / #1285 / #1304).\n\niperf-3.11 2022-01-31\n---------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * Update links to Discussions in documentation\n\n  * Fix DSCP so that TOS = DSCP * 4 (#1162)\n\n  * Fix --bind-dev for TCP streams (#1153)\n\n  * Fix interface specification so doesn't overlap with IPv6 link-local addresses for -c and -B (#1157, #1180)\n\n  * Add get/set test_unit_format function declaration to iperf_api.h\n\n  * Auto adjustment of test-end condition for file transfers (-F), if no end condition is set, it will automatically adjust it to file size in bytes\n\n  * Exit if idle time expires waiting for a connection in one-off mode (#1187, #1197)\n\n  * Support zerocopy by reverse mode (#1204)\n\n  * Update help and manpage text for #1157, support bind device\n\n  * Consistently print target_bandwidth in JSON start section (#1177)\n\n  * Test bitrate added to JSON output (#1168)\n\n  * Remove fsync call after every write to receiving --file (#1176, #1159)\n\n  * Update documentation for -w (#1175)\n\n  * Fix for #952, different JSON object names for bidir reverse channel\n\niperf-3.10.1 2021-06-03\n-----------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * Fixed a problem with autoconf scripts that made builds fail in\n    some environments (#1154 / #1155).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * GNU autoconf 2.71 or newer is now required to regenerate iperf3's\n    configure scripts.\n\niperf 3.10 2021-05-26\n---------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * Fix a bug where some --reverse tests didn't terminate (#982 /\n    #1054).\n\n  * Responsiveness of control connections is slightly improved (#1045\n    / #1046 / #1063).\n\n  * The allowable clock skew when doing authentication between client\n    and server is now configurable with the new --time-skew-threshold\n    (#1065 / #1070).\n\n  * Bitrate throttling using the -b option now works when a burst size\n    is specified (#1090).\n\n  * A bug with calculating CPU utilization has been fixed (#1076 /\n    #1077).\n\n  * A --bind-dev option to support binding sockets to a given network\n    interface has been added to make iperf3 work better with\n    multi-homed machines and/or VRFs (#817 / #1089 / #1097).\n\n  * --pidfile now works with --client mode (#1110).\n\n  * The server is now less likely to get stuck due to network errors\n    (#1101, #1125), controlled by the new --rcv-timeout option.\n\n  * Fixed a few bugs in termination conditions for byte or\n    block-limited tests (#1113, #1114, #1115).\n\n  * Added tcp_info.snd_wnd to JSON output (#1148).\n\n  * Some bugs with garbled JSON output have been fixed (#1086, #1118,\n    #1143 / #1146).\n\n  * Support for setting the IPv4 don't-fragment (DF) bit has been\n    added with the new --dont-fragment option (#1119).\n\n  * A failure with not being able to read the congestion control\n    algorithm under WSL1 has been fixed (#1061 / #1126).\n\n  * Error handling and error messages now make more sense in cases\n    where sockets were not successfully opened (#1129 / #1132 /\n    #1136, #1135 / #1138, #1128 / #1139).\n\n  * Some buffer overflow hazards were fixed (#1134).\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\n  * It is now possible to use the API to set/get the congestion\n    control algorithm (#1036 / #1112).\n\n\niperf 3.9 2020-08-17\n--------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * A --timestamps flag has been added, which prepends a timestamp to\n    each output line.  An optional argument to this flag, which is a\n    format specification to strftime(3), allows for custom timestamp\n    formats (#909, #1028).\n\n  * A --server-bitrate-limit flag has been added as a server-side\n    command-line argument.  It allows a server to enforce a maximum\n    throughput rate; client connections that specify a higher bitrate\n    or exceed this bitrate during a test will be terminated.  The\n    bitrate is expressed in bits per second, with an optional trailing\n    slash and integer count that specifies an averaging interval over\n    which to enforce the limit (#999).\n\n  * A bug that caused increased CPU usage with the --bidir option has\n    been fixed (#1011).\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\n  * Fixed various minor memory leaks (#1023).\n\niperf 3.8.1 2020-06-10\n----------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * A regression with \"make install\", where the libiperf shared\n    library files were not getting installed, has been fixed (#1013 /\n    #1014).\n\niperf 3.8 2020-06-08\n--------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * Profiled libraries and binaries are no longer built by default\n    (#950).\n\n  * A minimal Dockerfile has been added (#824).\n\n  * A bug with burst mode and unlimited rate has been fixed (#898).\n\n  * Configuring with the --enable-static-bin flag will now cause\n    a statically-linked iperf3 binary to be built (#989).\n\n  * Configuring with the --without-sctp flag will now prevent SCTP\n    from being auto-detected (#1008).  This flag allows building a\n    static binary (see above item) on a CentOS system with SCTP\n    installed, because no static SCTP libraries are available.\n\n  * Clock skew between the iperf3 client and server will no longer\n    skew the computation of jitter during UDP tests (#842 / #990).\n\n  * A possible buffer overflow in the authentication feature has been\n    fixed.  This was only relevant when configuration authentication\n    using the libiperf3 API, and did not affect command-line usage.\n    Various other improvements and fixes in this area were also made\n    (#996).\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\n  * The embedded version of cJSON has been updated to 1.7.13 (#978).\n\n  * Some server authentication functions have been added to the API\n    (#911).\n\n  * API access has been added to the connection timeout parameter\n    (#1001).\n\n  * Tests for some authentication functions have been added.\n\n  * Various compiler errors and warnings have been fixed.\n\niperf 3.7 2019-06-21\n--------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * Support for simultaneous bidirectional tests with the --bidir flag\n    (#201/#780).\n\n  * Use POSIX standard clock_gettime(3) interface for timekeeping where\n    available (#253/#738).\n\n  * Passwords for authentication can be provided via environment\n    variable (#815).\n\n  * Specifying --repeating-payload and --reverse now works (#867).\n\n  * Failed authentication doesn't count for --one-off (#864/#877).\n\n  * Several memory leaks related to authenticated use were fixed\n    (#881/#888).\n\n  * The delay for tearing down the control connection for the default\n    timed tests has been increased, to more gracefully handle\n    high-delay paths (#751/#859).\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\n  * Various improvements to the libiperf APIs (#767, #775, #869, #870,\n    #871)\n\n  * Fixed build behavior when OpenSSL is absent (#854).\n\n  * Portability fixes (#821/#874).\n\niperf 3.6 2018-06-25\n--------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * A new --extra-data option can be used to fill in a user-defined\n    string field that appears in JSON output.  (#600 / #729)\n\n  * A new --repeating-payload option makes iperf3 use a payload pattern\n    similar to that used by iperf2, which could help in recreating\n    results that might be affected by payload entropy (for example,\n    compression).  (#726)\n\n  * -B now works properly with SCTP tests.  (#678 / #715)\n\n  * A compile fix for Solaris 10 was added.  (#711)\n\n  * Some minor bug fixes for JSON output.  In particular, warnings for\n    debug and/or verbose modes with --json output (#737) and a fix for\n    JSON output on CentOS 6 (#727 / #744).\n\n  * software.es.net and downloads.es.net now support HTTPS, so URLs in\n    documentation that refer to those two hosts now use https://\n    instead of http:// URLs. (#759)\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\n  * Functions related to authenticated iperf3 connections have been\n    exposed via libiperf.  (#712 / #713)\n\n  * The ToS byte is now exposed in the libiperf API. (#719)\n\niperf 3.5 2018-03-02\n--------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * iperf3 no longer counts data received after the end of a test in\n    the bytecounts.  This fixes a bug that could, under some\n    conditions, artificially inflate the transfer size and measured\n    bitrate.  This bug was most noticeable on reverse direction\n    transfers on short tests over high-latency or buffer-bloated\n    paths.  Many thanks to @FuzzyStatic for providing access to a test\n    environment for diagnosing this issue (#692).\n\niperf 3.4 2018-02-14\n--------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * The -A (set processor affinity) command-line flag is now supported\n    on Windows (#665).\n\n  * iperf3 now builds on systems lacking a daemon(3) library call\n    (#369).\n\n  * A bug in time skew checking under authentication was fixed (#674).\n\n  * IPv6 flow labels now work correctly with multiple parallel streams\n    (#694).\n\n  * The client no longer closes its control connection before sending\n    end-of-test statistics to the server (#677). This fixes a\n    regression introduced in iperf-3.2.\n\n  * Sending output to stdout now makes errors go to stderr, as per\n    UNIX convention (#695).\n\n  * A server side crash in verbose output with a client running\n    multiple parallel connections has been fixed (#686).\n\n  * The --cport option can now be specified without the --bind option.\n    Using the --cport option on Linux can eliminate a problem with\n    ephemeral port number allocation that can make multi-stream iperf3\n    tests perform very poorly on LAGG links.  Also, the --cport option\n    now works on SCTP tests (#697).\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\n  * iperf3 now builds on (some) macOS systems older than 10.7 (#607).\n\n  * Some unused code and header inclusions were eliminated (#667,\n    #668).  Also some code was cleaned up to eliminate (or at least\n    reduce) compiler warnings (#664, #671).\n\niperf 3.3 2017-10-31\n--------------------\n\n* Notable user-visible changes\n\n  * iperf3 can now be built --without-openssl on systems where OpenSSL\n    is present (#624, #633).\n\n  * A bug with printing very large numbers has been fixed (#642).\n\n  * A bug where the server would, under certain circumstances, halt a\n    test after exactly fifteen seconds has been fixed (#645).\n\n  * The --tos parameter is no longer \"sticky\" between tests when doing\n    --reverse tests (#639).\n\n  * The authentication token on the server is properly reset between\n    tests (#650).\n\n  * A bug that could cause iperf3 to overwrite the PID file of an\n    already-existing iperf3 process has been fixed (#623).\n\n  * iperf3 will now ignore nonsensical TCP MSS values (from the TCP\n    control connection) when trying to determine a reasonable block\n    size for UDP tests.  This condition primarily affected users on\n    Windows, but potentially improves robustness for all\n    platforms. (#659)\n\n* Notable developer-visible changes\n\niperf 3.2 2017-06-26\n--------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Authentication via a username/password mechanism, coupled with a\n    public-key pair, is now an optional way of limiting access to an\n    iperf3 server (#517).\n\n  * Ending statistics are less ambiguous for UDP and also now use\n    correct test durations for all protocols (#560, #238).  Many fixes\n    have been made in statistics printing code, generally for\n    human-readable output (#562, #575, #252, #443, #236).\n\n  * Several problems with the -F/--file options have been fixed.\n    Documentation has been improved to note some ways in which this\n    feature might not behave as expected (#588).\n\n  * iperf3 now uses the correct \"bitrate\" phraseology rather than\n    \"bandwidth\" when describing measurement results.  The --bandwidth\n    option has been renamed --bitrate, although --bandwidth is still\n    accepted for backwards compatibility (#583).\n\n  * Application-level bandwidth pacing (--bitrate option) is now\n    checked every millisecond by default, instead of of every tenth of\n    a second, to provide smoother traffic behavior when using\n    application pacing (#460).  The pacing can be tuned via the use of\n    the --pacing-timer option (#563).\n\n  * A new --dscp option allows specifying the DSCP value to be used\n    for outgoing packets (#508).  The TOS byte value is now printed in\n    the JSON output (#226).\n\n  * Congestion window data on FreeBSD is now computed correctly (#465,\n    #475, #338).\n\n  * The T/t suffixes for terabytes/terabits are now accepted for\n    quantities where suffixes are supported, such as --bandwidth\n    (#402).\n\n  * Sanity checks for UDP send sizes have been added (#390), and\n    existing checks on the --window option have been improved (#557).\n\n  * The TCP rttvar value is now available in the JSON output (#534), as are\n    the socket buffer sizes (#558).\n\n  * Error handling and documentation have been improved for the\n    -f/--format options (#568).\n\n  * A new --connect-timeout option on the client allows specifying a\n    length of time that the client will attempt to connect to the\n    server, in milliseconds (#216).\n\n  * The hostname and current timestamp are no longer used in the\n    cookie used to associate the client and server.  Instead, random\n    data is used.  Note that iperf3 now requires the /dev/urandom\n    device (#582).\n\n  * Prior versions of iperf3 doing UDP tests used to overcount packet\n    losses in the presence of packet reordering.  This has been\n    (partially) fixed by try to not count the sequence number gaps\n    resulting from out-of-order packets as actual losses (#457).\n\n  * iperf3 no longer prints results from very small intervals (10% of\n    the statistics reporting interval) at the end of the test run if\n    they contain no data.  This can happen due to timing difference or\n    network queueing on the path between the client and server.  This\n    is primarily a cosmetic change to prevent these fairly meaningless\n    intervals from showing up in the output (#278).\n\n  * Compatibility note: Users running iperf3 3.2 or newer from the\n    bwctl utility will need to obtain version 1.6.3 or newer of bwctl.\n    Note that bwctl, a component of the perfSONAR toolkit, has been\n    deprecated in favor of pScheduler since the release of perfSONAR\n    4.0.\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * Various warnings and build fixes (#551, #564, #518, #597).\n\n  * Some improvements have been made for increased compatibility on\n    IRIX (#368) and with C++ (#587).\n\n  * cJSON has been updated to 1.5.2 (#573), bringing in a number of\n    bugfixes.\n\n  * Some dead code has been removed.\n\niperf 3.1.7 2017-03-06\n----------------------\n\niperf 3.1.7 is functionally identical to iperf 3.1.6.  Its only\nchanges consist of updated documentation files and text in the RPM\nspec file.\n\niperf 3.1.6 2017-02-02\n----------------------\n\nThe release notes for iperf 3.1.6 describe changes, including bug\nfixes and new functionality, made since iperf 3.1.5.\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Specifying --fq-rate or --no-fq-socket-pacing on a system where\n    these options are not supported now generate an error instead of a\n    warning.  This change makes diagnosing issues related to pacing\n    more apparent.\n\n  * Fixed a bug where two recently-added diagnostic messages spammed\n    the JSON output on UDP tests.\n\niperf 3.1.5 2017-01-12\n----------------------\n\nThe release notes for iperf 3.1.5 describe changes, including bug\nfixes and new functionality, made since iperf 3.1.4.\n\nCompatibility note: Fair-queueing is now specified differently in\niperf 3.1.5 than in prior versions (which include 3.1.3 and 3.1.4).\n\nCompatibility note: UDP tests may yield different results from all\nprior versions of iperf3 (through 3.1.4) due to the new default UDP\nsending size.\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * The fair-queueing per-socket based pacing available on recent\n    Linux systems has been reimplemented with a different user\n    interface (#325, #467, #488).  The --bandwidth command-line flag\n    now controls only the application-level pacing, as was the case in\n    iperf 3.1.2 and all earlier versions.  Fair-queueing per-socket\n    based pacing is now controlled via a new --fq-rate command-line\n    flag.  Note that TCP and UDP tests may use --bandwidth, --fq-rate,\n    both flags, or neither flag.  SCTP tests currently support\n    --bandwidth only.  The --no-fq-socket-pacing flag, which was\n    introduced in iperf 3.1.3, has now been deprecated, and is\n    equivalent to --fq-rate=0.  iperf3 now reacts more gracefully if\n    --no-fq-socket-pacing or --fq-rate are specified on platforms that\n    don't support these options.\n\n    For UDP tests, note that the default --bandwidth is 1 Mbps.  Using\n    the fair-queueing-based pacing will probably require explicitly\n    setting both --bandwidth and --fq-rate, preferably to the same\n    value.  (While setting different values for --bandwidth and\n    --fq-rate can certainly be done, the results can range from\n    entertaining to perplexing.)\n\n  * iperf3 now chooses a more sane default UDP send size (#496, #498).\n    The former default (8KB) caused IP packet fragmentation on paths\n    having smaller MTUs (including any Ethernet network not configured\n    for jumbo frames).  This could have effects ranging from increased\n    burstiness, to packet loss, to complete failure of the test.\n    iperf3 now attempts to use the MSS of the control connection to\n    determine a default UDP send size if no sending length was\n    explicitly specified with --length.\n\n  * Several checks are now made when setting the socket buffer sizes\n    with the -w option, to verify that the settings have been applied\n    correctly.  The results of these checks can been seen when the\n    --debug flag is specified.  (#356)\n\n  * A --forceflush flag has been added to flush the output stream\n    after every statistics reporting interval.\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * A systemd service file has been added (#340, #430).\n\niperf 3.1.4 2016-10-31\n----------------------\n\nThe release notes for iperf 3.1.4 describe changes, including bug\nfixes and new functionality, made since iperf 3.1.3.\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * On systems that support setting the congestion control algorithm,\n    iperf3 now keeps track of the congestion control algorithm and\n    print it in the JSON output in the members sender_tcp_congestion\n    and receiver_tcp_congestion (issue #461).  A few bugs (probably\n    not user-visible) with setting the congestion control algorithm\n    were also fixed.\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * Fixed a buffer overflow in the cJSON library (issue #466).  It is\n    not believed that this bug created any security vulnerabilities in\n    the context of iperf3.\n\n  * Travis CI builds are now enabled on this codeline (pull request #424).\n\n  * Various bug fixes (issue #459, pull request #429, issue #388).\n\niperf 3.1.3 2016-06-08\n----------------------\n\nThe release notes for iperf 3.1.3 describe changes, including bug\nfixes and new functionality, made since iperf 3.1.2.\n\n* Security\n\n  * Fixed a buffer overflow / heap corruption issue that could occur\n    if a malformed JSON string was passed on the control channel.  In\n    theory, this vulnerability could be leveraged to create a heap\n    exploit.  This issue, present in the cJSON library, was already\n    fixed upstream, so was addressed in iperf3 by importing a newer\n    version of cJSON (plus local ESnet modifications).  Discovered and\n    reported by Dave McDaniel, Cisco Talos.  Cross-references:\n    TALOS-CAN-0164, ESNET-SECADV-2016-0001, CVE-2016-4303.\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * On supported platforms (recent Linux), iperf3 can use\n    fair-queueing-based per-socket pacing instead of its own\n    application-level pacing for the --bandwidth option.\n    Application-level pacing can be forced with the\n    -no-fq-socket-pacing flag.\n\n  * A bug that could show negative loss counters with --udp and --omit\n    has been fixed (issue #412, pull request #414).\n\n  * Error handling has been made slightly more robust.  Also, the\n    iperf3 server will no longer exit after five consecutive errors,\n    but will only exit for certain types of errors that prevent it\n    from participating in any tests at all.\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * Fixed the build on FreeBSD 11-CURRENT (issue #413).\n\n  * Fixed various coding errors (issue #423, issue #425).\n\niperf 3.1.2 2016-02-01\n----------------------\n\nThe release notes for iperf 3.1.2 describe changes, including bug\nfixes and new functionality, made since iperf 3.1.1.\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Fixed a bug that caused nan values to be emitted (incorrectly)\n    into JSON, particularly at the end of UDP tests (issue #278).\n\n  * Fixed a bug that caused the wrong value to be printed for\n    out-of-order UDP packets (issue #329).\n\n  * Added a contrib/ directory containing a few submitted graphing\n    scripts.\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\niperf 3.1.1 2015-11-19\n----------------------\n\nThe release notes for iperf 3.1.1 describe changes and new\nfunctionality in iperf 3.1.1, but not present in 3.1.\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Some markup fixes have been made in the manpages for Debian\n    compatibility (issue #291).\n\n  * A bug where the -T title option was not being output correctly\n    in JSON output has been fixed (issue #292).\n\n  * Argument handling for some command-line options has been improved\n    (issue #316).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * A regression with C++ compatibility in one of the iperf header\n    files has been fixed (issue #323).\n\niperf 3.1 2015-10-16\n--------------------\n\nThe release notes for iperf 3.1 describe changes and new\nfunctionality in iperf 3.1, but not present in 3.0.11 or any earlier\n3.0.x release.\n\n* Selected user-visible changes\n\n  * SCTP support has been added (with the --sctp flag), on Linux,\n    FreeBSD, and Solaris (issue #131).\n\n  * Setting CPU affinity now works on FreeBSD.\n\n  * Selection of TCP congestion now works on FreeBSD, and is now\n    called --congestion (the old --linux-congestion option works\n    but is now deprecated).\n\n  * A new -I option for the server causes it to write a PID file,\n    mostly useful for daemon mode (issue #120).\n\n  * A --logfile argument can now force all output to go to a file,\n    rather than to a file.  This is especially useful when running an\n    iperf3 server in daemon mode (issue #119).\n\n  * Various compatibility fixes for Android (issue #184, issue #185),\n    iOS (issue #288), NetBSD (issue #248), Solaris (issue #175, issue\n    #178, issue #180, issue #211), vxWorks (issue #268).\n\n  * A --udp-counters-64bit flag has been added to support very\n    long-running UDP tests, which could cause a counter to overflow\n    (issue #191).\n\n  * A --cport option to specify the client-side port has been added\n    (issue #207, issue #209, issue #239).\n\n  * Some calculation errors with the -O feature have been fixed (issue\n    #236).\n\n  * A potential crash in the iperf3 server has been fixed (issue #257,\n    issue #258).\n\n  * Many miscellaneous bug fixes.\n\n* Selected developer-visible changes\n\n  * Consumers of libiperf can now get the JSON output for a\n    just-completed test (issue #147).\n\n  * Detection of various optional features has been improved to check\n    for the presence or absence of platform functionality, not the name\n    of platforms.\n\n  * Out-of-tree builds now work (issue #265).\n\niperf 3.0.11 2015-01-09\n-----------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Added -1 / --one-off flag, which causes the iperf3 server to\n    process one client connection and then exit.  Intended primarily\n    for bwctl integration (issue #230).\n\n  * Added various minor bug fixes (issues #231, #232, #233).\n\n  * Added 30-second timeout for UDP tests if unable to establish UDP\n    connectivity between sender and receiver (issue #222).\n\niperf 3.0.10 2014-12-16\n-----------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Fixed the build on MacOS X Yosemite (issue #213).\n\n  * UDP tests now honor the -w option for setting the socket buffer\n    sizes (issue #219).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * Added an RPM spec file plus functionality to fill in the version\n    number.\n\n  * Fixed potential filename collision with a system header (issue\n    #203).\n\niperf 3.0.9 2014-10-14\n----------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Fixed a series of problems that came from attempting a UDP test\n    with a pathologically large block size.  This put the server into\n    an odd state where it could not accept new client connections.\n    This in turn caused subsequent client connections to crash when\n    interrupted (issue #212).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * None.\n\niperf 3.0.8 2014-09-30\n----------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Updated license and copyright verbage to confirm to LBNL Tech\n    Transfer requirements.  No substantive changes; license remains\n    the 3-clause BSD license.\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * None.\n\niperf 3.0.7 2014-08-28\n----------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * A server bug where new connections from clients could disrupt\n    running tests has been fixed (issue #202).\n\n  * Rates now consistently use 1000-based prefixes (K, M, G), where\n    sizes of objects now consistently use 1024-based prefixes (issue #173).\n\n  * UDP tests with unlimited bandwidth are now supported (issue #170).\n\n  * An interaction between the -w and -B options, which kept them from\n    working when used together, has been fixed (issue #193).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\niperf 3.0.6 2014-07-28\n----------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Several bugs that kept the -B option from working in various\n    circumstances have been fixed (issue #193).\n\n  * Various compatibility fixes for OpenBSD (issue #196) and\n    Solaris (issue #177).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * The {get,set}_test_bind_address API calls have been added to\n    expose the -B functionality to API consumers (issue #197).\n\niperf 3.0.5 2014-06-16\n----------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Erroneous output when doing --json output has been fixed (this\n    problem was caused by an attempt to fix issue #158).\n\n  * The maximum test running time has been increased from one hour to\n    one day (issue #166).\n\n  * Project documentation has been moved to GitHub Pages at this URL:\n    http://software.es.net/iperf/.\n\n  * A bug that caused CPU time to be computed incorrectly on FreeBSD\n    has been fixed.\n\n  * A timing issue which caused measurement intervals to be wrong\n    with TCP tests on lossy networks has been fixed (issue #125).\n\n  * Newer versions of autoconf / automake / libtool are now used by\n    default (issue #161).\n\n  * JSON output now indicates whether the test was run in --reverse\n    mode (issue #167).\n\n  * It is now possible to get (most of) the server-side output at\n    the client by using the --get-server-output flag (issue #160).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * automake/autoconf/libtool have been updated to more recent\n    versions.  AM_MAINTAINER_MODE is now used to avoid requiring these\n    tools at build-time.\n\niperf 3.0.4 was not released\n----------------------------\n\niperf 3.0.3 2014-03-26\n----------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * Due to several oversights, the source code archive for iperf 3.0.2\n    was distributed as an uncompressed tarball, despite having an\n    extension (\".tar.gz\") that indicated it was compressed.  The\n    release generation procedure has been changed to avoid this\n    problem going forward.\n\n  * Summary structures in the JSON output are now included, even if\n    there is only one stream.  This change makes consuming the JSON\n    output easier and more consistent (issue #151).\n\n  * A possible buffer overflow in iperf_error.c has been fixed (issue\n    #155).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * Example programs now build correctly, after having been broken in\n    the 3.0.2 release (issue #152).\n\niperf 3.0.2 2014-03-10\n----------------------\n\n* User-visible changes\n\n  * The iperf3 project has been moved to GitHub, and various URLs in\n    documentation files have been changed to point there.\n\n  * iperf3 now builds on Linux systems that do not support\n    TCP_CONGESTION.  Most notably this allows iperf3 to work on CentOS\n    5.\n\n  * An abort on MacOS 10.9 has been fixed (issue #135).\n\n  * Added -I flag for the server to write a PID file, mostly useful for\n    daemon mode (issue #120).\n\n  * A bug that could break some TCP tests on FreeBSD has been fixed.\n\n  * TCP snd_cwnd output is now printed by default on Linux (issue #99).\n\n  * In JSON output, the --title string no longer has a colon and two\n    spaces appended (issue #139).\n\n  * A buffer for holding formatted numeric values is now\n    properly-sized so that output is not truncated (issue #142).\n\n* Developer-visible changes\n\n  * Some memory leaks have been fixed.\n\n  * A -d flag enables debugging output.\n\n  * A .gitignore file has been added.\n\n  * libtoolize is now invoked correctly from the bootstrap.sh script.\n\n  * The test unit format can now be set from the API (issue #144).\n\n  * libiperf is now built as both shared and static libraries.\n\n  * In the JSON output, the \"connection\" structures are now stored as\n    an array in the \"start\" block, instead of overwriting each other.\n    While technically an incompatible API change, the former behavior\n    generated unusable JSON.\n\niperf 3.0.1 2014-01-10\n----------------------\n\n  * Added the following new flags\n     -D, --daemon\t       run server as a daemon\n     -L, --flowlabel           set IPv6 flow label (Linux only)\n     -C, --linux-congestion    set congestion control algorithm (Linux only)\n     -k, --blockcount #[KMG]   number of blocks (packets) to transmit\n     \t \t      \t       (instead of -t or -n)\n  * Bug fixes\n\niperf 3.0-RC5 2013-11-15\n------------------------\n\n  * Added the following new flags\n     -F, --file name           xmit/recv the specified file\n     -A, --affinity n/n,m      set CPU affinity (Linux only)\n     -J, --json                output in JSON format\n     -Z, --zerocopy            use a 'zero copy' method of sending data\n     -O, --omit N              omit the first n seconds\n     -T, --title str           prefix every output line with this string\n  * more useful information in 'verbose' mode\n  * Many bug fixes\n\n\niperf 3.0b4 2010-08-02\n----------------------\n\n  * Added support for binding to a specific interface (-B)\n  * Added support for IPv6 mode (-6)\n  * Setting TCP window size (-w) is now supported\n  * Updates to iperf_error\n      * Added new errors\n      * Should generate more relevant messages\n  * Stream list now managed by queue.h macros\n  * Test structures are now kept intact after a test is run (for API users)\n  * Improved interval timer granularity\n      * Support for decimal values\n  * Many bug fixes\n\niperf 3.0b3 2010-07-23\n----------------------\n\n  * Better error handling\n      * All errors now handled with iperf_error()\n      * All functions that can return errors return NULL or -1 on error and set i_errno appropriately\n  * Iperf API introduced\n      * Support for adding new protocols\n      * Added support for callback functions\n          * on_connect - executes after a connection is made to the server\n          * on_new_stream - executes after a new stream is created\n          * on_test_start - executes right before the test begins\n          * on_test_finish - executes after the test is finished\n  * Added early support for verbose mode (-V)\n\niperf 3.0b2 2010-07-15\n----------------------\n\n  * UDP mode now supported\n      * Support for setting bandwidth (-b)\n      * Parallel UDP stream support\n      * Reverse mode UDP support\n  * Support for setting TCP_NODELAY (-N), disabling Nagle's Algorithm\n  * Support for setting TCP MSS (-M)\n      * Note: This feature is still in development. It is still very buggy.\n\niperf 3.0b1 2010-07-08\n----------------------\n\n  * TCP control socket now manages messages between client and server\n  * Dynamic server (gets test parameters from client)\n      * Server can now set test options dynamically without having to restart.\n          * Currently supported options: -l, -t, -n, -P, -R\n          * Future options: -u, -b, -w, -M, -N, -I, -T, -Z, -6\n  * Results exchange\n      * Client can now see server results (and vice versa)\n  * Reverse mode (-R)\n      * Server sends, client receives\n"

In an in-source build this is usually\n# harmless because $srcdir is '.', but things will broke when you\n# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.\n#\n# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,\n# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.

It\n#   sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads library and linker\n#   flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable to any special C compiler\n#   flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain compiler\n#   flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment variables.)\n#\n#   Also sets PTHREAD_CC and PTHREAD_CXX to any special C compiler that is\n#   needed for multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC\n#   respectively CXX otherwise). (This is necessary on e.g. AIX to use the\n#   special cc_r/CC_r compiler alias.)\n#\n#   NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,\n#   but also to link with them as well. For example, you might link with\n#   $PTHREAD_CC $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS\n#   $PTHREAD_CXX $CXXFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS\n#\n#   If you are only building threaded programs, you may wish to use these\n#   variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:\n#\n#     LIBS=\"$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS\"\n#     CFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS\"\n#     CXXFLAGS=\"$CXXFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS\"\n#     CC=\"$PTHREAD_CC\"\n#     CXX=\"$PTHREAD_CXX\"\n#\n#   In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute constant\n#   has a nonstandard name, this macro defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to\n#   that name (e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).\n#\n#   Also HAVE_PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT is defined if pthread is found and the\n#   PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT symbol is defined when compiling with\n#   PTHREAD_CFLAGS.\n#\n#   ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads library\n#   is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it\n#   is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action\n#   will define HAVE_PTHREAD.\n#\n#   Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform, or if\n#   you have any other suggestions or comments. This macro was based on work\n#   by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/) (with help\n#   from M. Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread macros posted by\n#   Alejandro Forero Cuervo to the autoconf macro repository.
