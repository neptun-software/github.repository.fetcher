If you're not sure, open a terminal and type `firejail\n  --version`.\n- Linux distribution (so that we can try to reproduce it, if necessary).\n- If you know that the problem did not exist in an earlier version of firejail,\n  please mention it.\n- If you are reporting that a program does not work with firejail, please also\n  run firejail with the `--noprofile` argument.  For example, if `firejail\n  firefox` does not work, please also run `firejail --noprofile firefox` and\n  let us know if it runs correctly or not.\n- You may also try disabling various options provided in\n  `/etc/firejail/<ProgramName.profile>` until you find out which one causes\n  problems.  It will significantly help in finding a solution for your issue.\n\nPlease note: If you are running Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or another related\ndistribution and you installed firejail from your distro's repositories, please\nensure that **all** of the following packages were installed:\n\n- firejail\n- firejail-profiles\n\nA common source of issues is that firejail-profiles was not installed when\ninstalling firejail.\n\n## Security vulnerabilities\n\nSee [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).\n\n## Opening a pull request\n\nPull requests with enhancements, bugfixes or new profiles are very welcome.\n\nIf you want to write a new profile, the easiest way to do this is to use the\nprofile template:\n\n- [etc/templates/profile.template](etc/templates/profile.template)\n\nIf you have already written a profile, please make sure it follows the rules\ndescribed in the template.\n\nIf you add a new command, here's the checklist:\n\n- [ ] Update manpages: firejail(1) and firejail-profile(5)\n- [ ] Update shell completions\n- [ ] Update syntax files (run `make syntax` or just `make`)\n- [ ] Update --help\n\n## Editing the wiki\n\nYou are highly encouraged to add your own tips and tricks to the\n[wiki](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/wiki).\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

It allows a process and all its descendants to have their own\nprivate view of the globally shared kernel resources, such as the network\nstack, process table and mount table.  Firejail can work in an SELinux or\nAppArmor environment, and it is integrated with Linux Control Groups.\n\nWritten in C with virtually no dependencies, the software runs on any Linux\ncomputer with a 3.x kernel version or newer.  It can sandbox any type of\nprocesses: servers, graphical applications, and even user login sessions.  The\nsoftware includes sandbox profiles for a number of more common Linux programs,\nsuch as Mozilla Firefox, Chromium, VLC, Transmission etc.\n\nThe sandbox is lightweight, the overhead is low.  There are no complicated\nconfiguration files to edit, no socket connections open, no daemons running in\nthe background.  All security features are implemented directly in Linux kernel\nand available on any Linux computer.\n\n## Videos\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n\n<td>\n<a href=\"https://odysee.com/@netblue30:9/install\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"https://thumbs.odycdn.com/f19bcfa08c2b35658dc18f4e2fd63f3f.webp\"\nalt=\"Quick Start\" width=\"240\" height=\"142\" border=\"10\" />\n<br/>Quick Start\n</a>\n</td>\n\n<td>\n<a href=\"https://odysee.com/@netblue30:9/firefox\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"https://thumbs.odycdn.com/acf4b1c66737feb97640fb1d28a7daa6.png\"\nalt=\"Advanced Browser Security\" width=\"240\" height=\"142\" border=\"10\" />\n<br/>Advanced Browser Security\n</a>\n</td>\n\n<td>\n<a href=\"https://odysee.com/@netblue30:9/tor\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"https://thumbs.odycdn.com/f6aa82bd7b86b2f17caed03ccb870d2b.webp\"\nalt=\"Tor Browser Security\" width=\"240\" height=\"142\" border=\"10\" />\n<br/>Tor Browser Security\n</a>\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n## Links\n\n* Project webpage: <https://firejail.wordpress.com/>\n* IRC: <https://web.libera.chat/#firejail>\n* Download and Installation: <https://firejail.wordpress.com/download-2/>\n* Features: <https://firejail.wordpress.com/features-3/>\n* Documentation: <https://firejail.wordpress.com/documentation-2/>\n* FAQ: <https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions>\n* Wiki: <https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/wiki>\n* GitHub Actions: <https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/actions>\n* GitLab CI: <https://gitlab.com/Firejail/firejail_ci/pipelines>\n* Video Channel: <https://odysee.com/@netblue30:9?order=new>\n* Backup Video Channel: <https://www.bitchute.com/profile/JSBsA1aoQVfW/>\n\n## Security vulnerabilities\n\nSee [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).\n\n## Installing\n\n### Debian\n\nDebian stable (bullseye): We recommend to use the\n[backports](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye-backports/firejail) package.\n\n### Ubuntu\n\nNote: The PPA recommendation is mainly for firejail itself; it should be fine\nto install firetools and firejail-related tools directly from the distribution\nif they are not in the PPA as they tend to be updated less frequently.\n\nFor Ubuntu 18.04+ and derivatives (such as Linux Mint), users are **strongly\nadvised** to use the\n[PPA](https://launchpad.net/~deki/+archive/ubuntu/firejail).\n\nHow to add and install from the PPA:\n\n```sh\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:deki/firejail\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firejail firejail-profiles\n```\n\nReason: The firejail package for Ubuntu 20.04 has been left vulnerable to\nCVE-2021-26910 for months after a patch for it was posted on Launchpad:\n\n* [CVE-2021-26910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2q4h-h5jp-942w)\n* [firejail version in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is vulnerable to\n  CVE-2021-26910](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firejail/+bug/1916767)\n\nSee also <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/FAQ>:\n\n> What software is supported by the Ubuntu Security team?\n>\n> Ubuntu is currently divided into four components: main, restricted, universe\n> and multiverse.  All binary packages in main and restricted are supported by\n> the Ubuntu Security team for the life of an Ubuntu release, while binary\n> packages in universe and multiverse are supported by the Ubuntu community.\n\nAdditionally, the PPA version is likely to be more recent and to contain more\nprofile fixes.\n\nSee the following discussions for details:\n\n* [Should I keep using the version of firejail available in my distro\n  repos?](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/discussions/4666)\n* [How to install the latest version on Ubuntu and\n  derivatives](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/discussions/4663)\n\n### Other\n\nFirejail is available in multiple Linux distributions:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Repology</summary>\n<p>\n\n[![Packaging status (Repology)](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/firejail.svg)](https://repology.org/project/firejail/versions)\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\nOther than the [aforementioned exceptions](#installing), as long as your\ndistribution provides a [supported version](SECURITY.md) of firejail, it's\ngenerally a good idea to install it from the distribution.\n\nThe version can be checked with `firejail --version` after installing.\n\nYou can also install one of the [released\npackages](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/releases).\n\n## Building\n\nYou can clone the source code from this git repository and build manually:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/netblue30/firejail.git\ncd firejail\n./configure && make && sudo make install-strip\n```\n\nOn Debian/Ubuntu you will need to install git and gcc.\n\nTo build with AppArmor support (which is usually used on Debian, Ubuntu,\nopenSUSE and derivatives), install the AppArmor development libraries and\npkg-config and use the `--enable-apparmor` ./configure option:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install git build-essential libapparmor-dev pkg-config gawk\n```\n\nTo build with SELinux support (which is usually used on Fedora, RHEL and\nderivatives), install libselinux1-dev (libselinux-devel on Fedora) and use the\n`--enable-selinux` ./configure option.\n\nDetailed information on using firejail from git is available on the\n[wiki](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/wiki/Using-firejail-from-git).\n\n## Running the sandbox\n\nTo start the sandbox, prefix your command with `firejail`:\n\n```sh\nfirejail firefox            # starting Mozilla Firefox\nfirejail transmission-gtk   # starting Transmission BitTorrent\nfirejail vlc                # starting VideoLAN Client\nsudo firejail /etc/init.d/nginx start\n```\n\nRun `firejail --list` in a terminal to list all active sandboxes.  Example:\n\n```console\n$ firejail --list\n1617:netblue:/usr/bin/firejail /usr/bin/firefox-esr\n7719:netblue:/usr/bin/firejail /usr/bin/transmission-qt\n7779:netblue:/usr/bin/firejail /usr/bin/galculator\n7874:netblue:/usr/bin/firejail /usr/bin/vlc --started-from-file file:///home/netblue/firejail-whitelist.mp4\n7916:netblue:firejail --list\n```\n\n## Desktop integration\n\nIntegrate your sandbox into your desktop by running the following two commands:\n\n```sh\nfirecfg --fix-sound\nsudo firecfg\n```\n\nThe first command solves some shared memory/PID namespace bugs in PulseAudio\nsoftware prior to version 9.  The second command integrates Firejail into your\ndesktop.  You would need to logout and login back to apply PulseAudio changes.\n\nStart your programs the way you are used to: desktop manager menus, file\nmanager, desktop launchers.\n\nThe integration applies to any program supported by default by Firejail.  There\nare over 900 default applications in the current Firejail version, and the\nnumber goes up with every new release.\n\nWe keep the application list in\n[src/firecfg/firecfg.config](src/firecfg/firecfg.config)\n(/etc/firejail/firecfg.config when installed).\n\n## Security profiles\n\nMost Firejail command line options can be passed to the sandbox using profile\nfiles.\n\nYou can find the profiles for all supported applications in [etc/](etc/)\n(/etc/firejail/ when installed).\n\nWe also keep a list of profile fixes for previous released versions in\n[etc-fixes/](etc-fixes/).\n\nIf you keep additional Firejail security profiles in a public repository,\nplease give us a link:\n\n* <https://github.com/chiraag-nataraj/firejail-profiles>\n* <https://github.com/triceratops1/fe>\n\nUse this issue to request new profiles:\n\n* [Profile requests](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/1139)\n\nYou can also use this tool to get a list of syscalls needed by a program:\n\n* [contrib/syscalls.sh](contrib/syscalls.sh)\n\n## Uninstalling\n\nfirecfg creates symlinks in /usr/local/bin, so to fully remove firejail, run\nthe following before uninstalling:\n\n```sh\nsudo firecfg --clean\n```\n\nSee `man firecfg` for details.\n\nNote: Broken symlinks are ignored when searching for an executable in `$PATH`,\nso uninstalling without doing the above should not cause issues.\n\n## Latest released version: 0.9.72\n\n## Current development version: 0.9.73\n\n### --keep-shell-rc\n\n```text\n       --keep-shell-rc\n              By default, when using a private home directory, firejail copies\n              files  from the system's user home template (/etc/skel) into it,\n              which overrides attempts to whitelist the original  files  (such\n              as  ~/.bashrc and ~/.zshrc).  This option disables this feature,\n              and enables the user to whitelist the original files.\n```\n\n### private-etc rework\n\n```text\n       --private-etc, --private-etc=file,directory,@group\n              The files installed by --private-etc are copies of the original\n              system files from /etc directory.  By default, the command\n              brings in a skeleton of files and directories used by most\n              console tools:\n\n              $ firejail --private-etc dig debian.org\n\n              For X11/GTK/QT/Gnome/KDE  programs add @x11 group as a\n              parameter. Example:\n\n              $ firejail --private-etc=@x11,gcrypt,python* gimp\n\n              gcrypt and /etc/python* directories are not part of the generic\n              @x11 group.  File globbing is supported.\n\n              For games, add @games group:\n\n              $ firejail --private-etc=@games,@x11 warzone2100\n\n              Sound and networking files are included automatically, unless\n              --nosound or --net=none are specified.  Files for encrypted\n              TLS/SSL protocol are in @tls-ca group.\n\n              $ firejail --private-etc=@tls-ca,wgetrc wget https://debian.org\n\n              Note: The easiest way to extract the list of /etc files accessed\n              by your program is using strace utility:\n\n              $ strace /usr/bin/transmission-qt 2>&1 | grep open | grep etc\n```\n\nWe keep the list of groups in\n[src/include/etc_groups.h](src/include/etc_groups.h).\n\nDiscussion:\n\n* [private-etc rework](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/discussions/5610)\n\n### Landlock support\n\n* Added on #6078, which is based on #5315 from ChrysoliteAzalea/landlock\n* Compile-time detection based on linux/landlock.h - if the header is found,\n  the feature is compiled in\n* Runtime detection based on whether Landlock is supported by the kernel and is\n  enabled on the system\n\n```text\nLANDLOCK\n       Landlock is a Linux security module first introduced in version 5.13 of\n       the  Linux  kernel.  It allows unprivileged processes to restrict their\n       access to the filesystem.  Once imposed, these restrictions  can  never\n       be  removed,  and  all child processes created by a Landlock-restricted\n       processes inherit these restrictions.  Firejail supports Landlock as an\n       additional  sandboxing  feature.  It can be used to ensure that a sand‐\n       boxed application can only access files and directories that it was ex‐\n       plicitly  allowed  to access.  Firejail supports populating the ruleset\n       with both a basic set of rules (see --landlock) and with a  custom  set\n       of rules.\n\n       Important notes:\n\n              - A process can install a Landlock ruleset only if it has either\n              CAP_SYS_ADMIN in its effective capability set, or  the  \"No  New\n              Privileges\"  restriction enabled.  Because of this, enabling the\n              Landlock feature will also cause Firejail to enable the \"No  New\n              Privileges\"  restriction,  regardless  of  the  profile  or  the\n              --nonewprivs command line option.\n\n              - Access to the /proc directory is managed through  the  --land‐\n              lock.proc command line option.\n\n              -  Access  to  the  /etc directory is automatically allowed.  To\n              override this, use the --writable-etc command line option.   You\n              can  also use the --private-etc option to restrict access to the\n              /etc directory.\n\n       To enable Landlock self-restriction on top of your current Firejail se‐\n       curity  features,  pass  --landlock flag to Firejail command line.  You\n       can also use --landlock.read, --landlock.write, --landlock.special  and\n       --landlock.execute  options  together with --landlock or instead of it.\n       Example:\n\n       $ firejail --landlock --landlock.read=/media --landlock.proc=ro mc\n```\n\n### Profile Statistics\n\nA small tool to print profile statistics.  Compile and install as usual.  The\ntool is installed in the /usr/lib/firejail directory.\n\nRun it over the profiles in /etc/profiles:\n\n```console\n$ /usr/lib/firejail/profstats /etc/firejail/*.profile\nNo include .local found in /etc/firejail/noprofile.profile\nWarning: multiple caps in /etc/firejail/tidal-hifi.profile\nWarning: multiple caps in /etc/firejail/tqemu.profile\nWarning: multiple caps in /etc/firejail/transmission-daemon.profile\n\nStats:\n    profiles\t\t\t1305\n    include local profile\t1304   (include profile-name.local)\n    include globals\t\t1271   (include globals.local)\n    blacklist ~/.ssh\t\t1167   (include disable-common.inc)\n    seccomp\t\t\t1178\n    capabilities\t\t1298\n    noexec\t\t\t1178   (include disable-exec.inc)\n    noroot\t\t\t1077\n    memory-deny-write-execute\t309\n    restrict-namespaces\t\t1026\n    apparmor\t\t\t833\n    private-bin\t\t\t790\n    private-dev\t\t\t1140\n    private-etc\t\t\t811\n    private-lib\t\t\t85\n    private-tmp\t\t\t1004\n    whitelist home directory\t642\n    whitelist var\t\t950   (include whitelist-var-common.inc)\n    whitelist run/user\t\t1268   (include whitelist-runuser-common.inc\n\t\t\t\t\tor blacklist ${RUNUSER})\n    whitelist usr/share\t\t732   (include whitelist-usr-share-common.inc\n    net none\t\t\t443\n    dbus-user none \t\t738\n    dbus-user filter \t\t192\n    dbus-system none \t\t939\n    dbus-system filter \t\t13\n\n```\n"
