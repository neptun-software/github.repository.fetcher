          "content": "                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\n    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n"

Many people working\n       in these organizations do not care for laws and ethics anyways.\n            You are not one of the \"good\" ones if you ignore this.)\n\n           NOTE: no this is not meant to be a markdown doc! old school!\n\n\nHydra in the most current github state can be directly downloaded via docker:\n```\ndocker pull vanhauser/hydra\n```\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n------------\nNumber one of the biggest security holes are passwords, as every password\nsecurity study shows.\nThis tool is a proof of concept code, to give researchers and security\nconsultants the possibility to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized\naccess from remote to a system.\n\nTHIS TOOL IS FOR LEGAL PURPOSES ONLY!\n\nThere are already several login hacker tools available, however, none does\neither support more than one protocol to attack or support parallelized\nconnects.\n\nIt was tested to compile cleanly on Linux, Windows/Cygwin, Solaris,\nFreeBSD/OpenBSD, QNX (Blackberry 10) and MacOS.\n\nCurrently this tool supports the following protocols:\n Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP,\n HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY,\n HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST,\n HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener,\n Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin,\n Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5,\n SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, Teamspeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth,\n VNC and XMPP.\n\nHowever the module engine for new services is very easy so it won't take a\nlong time until even more services are supported.\nYour help in writing, enhancing or fixing modules is highly appreciated!! :-)\n\n\n\nWHERE TO GET\n------------\nYou can always find the newest release/production version of hydra at its\nproject page at https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra/releases\nIf you are interested in the current development state, the public development\nrepository is at Github:\n  svn co https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra\n or\n  git clone https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra\nUse the development version at your own risk. It contains new features and\nnew bugs. Things might not work!\n\nAlternatively (and easier) to can pull it as a docker container:\n```\ndocker pull vanhauser/hydra\n```\n\n\nHOW TO COMPILE\n--------------\nTo configure, compile and install hydra, just type:\n\n```\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n```\n\nIf you want the ssh module, you have to setup libssh (not libssh2!) on your\nsystem,  get it from https://www.libssh.org, for ssh v1 support you also need\nto add \"-DWITH_SSH1=On\" option in the cmake command line.\nIMPORTANT: If you compile on MacOS then you must do this - do not install libssh via brew!\n\nIf you use Ubuntu/Debian, this will install supplementary libraries needed\nfor a few optional modules (note that some might not be available on your distribution):\n\n```\napt-get install libssl-dev libssh-dev libidn11-dev libpcre3-dev \\\n                 libgtk2.0-dev libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev libsvn-dev \\\n                 firebird-dev libmemcached-dev libgpg-error-dev \\\n                 libgcrypt11-dev libgcrypt20-dev\n```\n\nThis enables all optional modules and features with the exception of Oracle,\nSAP R/3, NCP and the apple filing protocol - which you will need to download and\ninstall from the vendor's web sites.\n\nFor all other Linux derivates and BSD based systems, use the system\nsoftware installer and look for similarly named libraries like in the\ncommand above. In all other cases, you have to download all source libraries\nand compile them manually.\n\n\n\nSUPPORTED PLATFORMS\n-------------------\n- All UNIX platforms (Linux, *BSD, Solaris, etc.)\n- MacOS (basically a BSD clone)\n- Windows with Cygwin (both IPv4 and IPv6)\n- Mobile systems based on Linux, MacOS or QNX (e.g. Android, iPhone, Blackberry 10, Zaurus, iPaq)\n\n\n\nHOW TO USE\n----------\nIf you just enter `hydra`, you will see a short summary of the important\noptions available.\nType `./hydra -h` to see all available command line options.\n\nNote that NO login/password file is included. Generate them yourself.\nA default password list is however present, use \"dpl4hydra.sh\" to generate\na list.\n\nFor Linux users, a GTK GUI is available, try `./xhydra`\n\nFor the command line usage, the syntax is as follows:\n For attacking one target or a network, you can use the new \"://\" style:\n  hydra [some command line options] PROTOCOL://TARGET:PORT/MODULE-OPTIONS\n The old mode can be used for these too, and additionally if you want to\n specify your targets from a text file, you *must* use this one:\n\n```\nhydra [some command line options] [-s PORT] TARGET PROTOCOL [MODULE-OPTIONS]\n```\n\nVia the command line options you specify which logins to try, which passwords,\nif SSL should be used, how many parallel tasks to use for attacking, etc.\n\nPROTOCOL is the protocol you want to use for attacking, e.g. ftp, smtp,\nhttp-get or many others are available\nTARGET is the target you want to attack\nMODULE-OPTIONS are optional values which are special per PROTOCOL module\n\nFIRST - select your target\n you have three options on how to specify the target you want to attack:\n 1. a single target on the command line: just put the IP or DNS address in\n 2. a network range on the command line: CIDR specification like \"192.168.0.0/24\"\n 3. a list of hosts in a text file: one line per entry (see below)\n\nSECOND - select your protocol\n Try to avoid telnet, as it is unreliable to detect a correct or false login attempt.\n Use a port scanner to see which protocols are enabled on the target.\n\nTHIRD - check if the module has optional parameters\n hydra -U PROTOCOL\n e.g. hydra -U smtp\n\nFOURTH - the destination port\n this is optional, if no port is supplied the default common port for the\n PROTOCOL is used.\n If you specify SSL to use (\"-S\" option), the SSL common port is used by default.\n\n\nIf you use \"://\" notation, you must use \"[\" \"]\" brackets if you want to supply\nIPv6 addresses or CIDR (\"192.168.0.0/24\") notations to attack:\n  hydra [some command line options] ftp://[192.168.0.0/24]/\n  hydra [some command line options] -6 smtps://[2001:db8::1]/NTLM\n\nNote that everything hydra does is IPv4 only!\nIf you want to attack IPv6 addresses, you must add the \"-6\" command line option.\nAll attacks are then IPv6 only!\n\nIf you want to supply your targets via a text file, you can not use the ://\nnotation but use the old style and just supply the protocol (and module options):\n  hydra [some command line options] -M targets.txt ftp\nYou can also supply the port for each target entry by adding \":<port>\" after a\ntarget entry in the file, e.g.:\n\n```\nfoo.bar.com\ntarget.com:21\nunusual.port.com:2121\ndefault.used.here.com\n127.0.0.1\n127.0.0.1:2121\n```\n\nNote that if you want to attach IPv6 targets, you must supply the -6 option\nand *must* put IPv6 addresses in brackets in the file(!) like this:\n\n```\nfoo.bar.com\ntarget.com:21\n[fe80::1%eth0]\n[2001::1]\n[2002::2]:8080\n[2a01:24a:133:0:00:123:ff:1a]\n```\n\nLOGINS AND PASSWORDS\n--------------------\nYou have many options on how to attack with logins and passwords\nWith -l for login and -p for password you tell hydra that this is the only\nlogin and/or password to try.\nWith -L for logins and -P for passwords you supply text files with entries.\ne.g.:\n\n```\nhydra -l admin -p password ftp://localhost/\nhydra -L default_logins.txt -p test ftp://localhost/\nhydra -l admin -P common_passwords.txt ftp://localhost/\nhydra -L logins.txt -P passwords.txt ftp://localhost/\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can try passwords based on the login via the \"-e\" option.\nThe \"-e\" option has three parameters:\n\n```\ns - try the login as password\nn - try an empty password\nr - reverse the login and try it as password\n```\n\nIf you want to, e.g. try \"try login as password and \"empty password\", you \nspecify \"-e sn\" on the command line.\n\nBut there are two more modes for trying passwords than -p/-P:\nYou can use text file which where a login and password pair is separated by a colon,\ne.g.:\n\n```\nadmin:password\ntest:test\nfoo:bar\n```\n\nThis is a common default account style listing, that is also generated by the\ndpl4hydra.sh default account file generator supplied with hydra.\nYou use such a text file with the -C option - note that in this mode you\ncan not use -l/-L/-p/-P options (-e nsr however you can).\nExample:\n\n```\nhydra -C default_accounts.txt ftp://localhost/\n```\n\nAnd finally, there is a bruteforce mode with the -x option (which you can not\nuse with -p/-P/-C):\n\n```\n-x minimum_length:maximum_length:charset\n```\n\nthe charset definition is `a` for lowercase letters, `A` for uppercase letters,\n`1` for numbers and for anything else you supply it is their real representation.\nExamples:\n\n```\n-x 1:3:a generate passwords from length 1 to 3 with all lowercase letters\n-x 2:5:/ generate passwords from length 2 to 5 containing only slashes\n-x 5:8:A1 generate passwords from length 5 to 8 with uppercase and numbers\n-x '3:3:aA1&~#\\\\ \"\\'<{([-|_^@)]=}>$%*?./§,;:!`' -v generates lenght 3 passwords with all 95 characters, and verbose. \n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\nhydra -l ftp -x 3:3:a ftp://localhost/\n```\n\nSPECIAL OPTIONS FOR MODULES\n---------------------------\nVia the third command line parameter (TARGET SERVICE OPTIONAL) or the -m\ncommand line option, you can pass one option to a module.\nMany modules use this, a few require it!\n\nTo see the special option of a module, type:\n\n  hydra -U <module>\n\ne.g.\n\n  ./hydra -U http-post-form\n\nThe special options can be passed via the -m parameter, as 3rd command line\noption or in the service://target/option format.\n\nExamples (they are all equal):\n\n```\n./hydra -l test -p test -m PLAIN 127.0.0.1 imap\n./hydra -l test -p test 127.0.0.1 imap PLAIN\n./hydra -l test -p test imap://127.0.0.1/PLAIN\n```\n\nRESTORING AN ABORTED/CRASHED SESSION\n------------------------------------\nWhen hydra is aborted with Control-C, killed or crashes, it leaves a\n\"hydra.restore\" file behind which contains all necessary information to\nrestore the session. This session file is written every 5 minutes.\nNOTE: the hydra.restore file can NOT be copied to a different platform (e.g.\nfrom little endian to big endian, or from Solaris to AIX)\n\nHOW TO SCAN/CRACK OVER A PROXY\n------------------------------\nThe environment variable HYDRA_PROXY_HTTP defines the web proxy (this works\njust for the http services!).\nThe following syntax is valid:\n\n```\nHYDRA_PROXY_HTTP=\"http://123.45.67.89:8080/\"\nHYDRA_PROXY_HTTP=\"http://login:password@123.45.67.89:8080/\"\nHYDRA_PROXY_HTTP=\"proxylist.txt\"\n```\n\nThe last example is a text file containing up to 64 proxies (in the same\nformat definition as the other examples).\n\nFor all other services, use the HYDRA_PROXY variable to scan/crack.\nIt uses the same syntax. eg:\n\n```\nHYDRA_PROXY=[connect|socks4|socks5]://[login:password@]proxy_addr:proxy_port\n```\n\nfor example:\n\n```\nHYDRA_PROXY=connect://proxy.anonymizer.com:8000\nHYDRA_PROXY=socks4://auth:pw@127.0.0.1:1080\nHYDRA_PROXY=socksproxylist.txt\n```\n\nADDITIONAL HINTS\n----------------\n* sort your password files by likelihood and use the -u option to find\n  passwords much faster!\n* uniq your dictionary files! this can save you a lot of time :-)\n    cat words.txt | sort | uniq > dictionary.txt\n* if you know that the target is using a password policy (allowing users\n  only to choose a password with a minimum length of 6, containing a least one\n  letter and one number, etc. use the tool pw-inspector which comes along\n  with the hydra package to reduce the password list:\n    cat dictionary.txt | pw-inspector -m 6 -c 2 -n > passlist.txt\n\n\nRESULTS OUTPUT\n--------------\n\nThe results are output to stdio along with the other information.  Via the -o\ncommand line option, the results can also be written to a file.  Using -b,\nthe format of the output can be specified.  Currently, these are supported:\n\n* `text`   - plain text format\n* `jsonv1` - JSON data using version 1.x of the schema (defined below).\n* `json`   - JSON data using the latest version of the schema, currently there\n             is only version 1.\n\nIf using JSON output, the results file may not be valid JSON if there are\nserious errors in booting Hydra.\n\n\nJSON Schema\n-----------\nHere is an example of the JSON output.  Notes on some of the fields:\n\n* `errormessages` - an array of zero or more strings that are normally printed\n   to stderr at the end of the Hydra's run.  The text is very free form.\n* `success` - indication if Hydra ran correctly without error (**NOT** if\n   passwords were detected).  This parameter is either the JSON value `true`\n   or `false` depending on completion.  \n* `quantityfound` - How many username+password combinations discovered.\n* `jsonoutputversion` - Version of the schema, 1.00, 1.01, 1.11, 2.00,\n   2.03, etc.  Hydra will make second tuple of the version to always be two\n   digits to make it easier for downstream processors (as opposed to v1.1 vs\n   v1.10).  The minor-level versions are additive, so 1.02 will contain more\n   fields than version 1.00 and will be backward compatible.  Version 2.x will\n   break something from version 1.x output.  \n\nVersion 1.00 example:\n```\n{\n    \"errormessages\": [\n        \"[ERROR] Error Message of Something\",\n        \"[ERROR] Another Message\",\n        \"These are very free form\"\n    ],\n    \"generator\": {\n        \"built\": \"2021-03-01 14:44:22\",\n        \"commandline\": \"hydra -b jsonv1 -o results.json ... ...\",\n        \"jsonoutputversion\": \"1.00\",\n        \"server\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n        \"service\": \"http-post-form\",\n        \"software\": \"Hydra\",\n        \"version\": \"v8.5\"\n    },\n    \"quantityfound\": 2,\n    \"results\": [\n        {\n            \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n            \"login\": \"bill@example.com\",\n            \"password\": \"bill\",\n            \"port\": 9999,\n            \"service\": \"http-post-form\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n            \"login\": \"joe@example.com\",\n            \"password\": \"joe\",\n            \"port\": 9999,\n            \"service\": \"http-post-form\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"success\": false\n}\n```\n\n\nSPEED\n-----\nthrough the parallelizing feature, this password cracker tool can be very\nfast, however it depends on the protocol. The fastest are generally POP3\nand FTP.\nExperiment with the task option (-t) to speed things up!

You may use this program, or\n *  code or tables extracted from it, as desired without restriction.\n *\n *  First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The\n *  polynomial is\n *  X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0\n *\n *  Note that we take it \"backwards\" and put the highest-order term in\n *  the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is \"implied\"; the LSB is the\n *  X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as \"+1\") results in\n *  the MSB being 1\n *\n *  Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which\n *  is what we're using (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit\n *  chunks at a time) shifts bits into the lowest-order term.  In our\n *  implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why do we\n *  do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in\n *  order from highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit\n *  characters in order from LSB to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way\n *  we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to high-byte; the UART\n *  sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit\n *  by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit\n *  shuffling on our part.  Reception works similarly\n *\n *  The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes\n *\n *      The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so\n *      is shown later.

The module can be invoked\nwith the service names of \"http-get-form\", \"http-post-form\",\n\"https-get-form\" and \"https-post-form\".\n\nHere's a couple of examples: -\n\n./hydra -l \"<userID>\" -P pass.txt 10.221.64.12 http-post-form\n\"/irmlab2/testsso-auth.do:ID=^USER^&Password=^PASS^:Invalid Password\"\n\n./hydra -S -s 443 -l \"<username>\" -P pass.txt 10.221.64.2 https-get-form\n\"/irmlab1/vulnapp.php:username=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:incorrect\"\n\nThe option field (following the service field) takes \":\" separated values:\nThe first is the page on the server to GET or POST to.\nThe second is the POST/GET variables (taken from either the browser, or a proxy\nsuch as ZAP) with the varying usernames and passwords in the \"^USER^\" and\n\"^PASS^\" placeholders.\nThe third + are optional parameters like C=, H= etc. (see below)\nThe final(!) parameter is the string that it checks for an *invalid* or *valid*\nlogin\nSo please:\n * invalid condition login should be preceded by \"F=\"\n * valid condition login should be preceded by \"S=\".\nBy default, if no header is found the condition is assume to be a fail (F=),\nso checking for an *invalid* login string.\n\nIf you specify the debug flag (-d) it will show you the response from the\nHTTP server which is useful for checking the result of a failed login to\nfind something to pattern match against.

This may be useful for an auditor who has aquired\n   a sam._ or pwdump file and would like to quickly determine\n   which are valid entries. This module can also be used to test\n   SMB passwords against devices that do not allow clear text\n   LanMan passwords.\n\n   The \"-m 'METHOD'\" option is required for this module. The\n   following are valid methods: Local, Domain, Hash, Machine,\n   NTLMV2, NTLM, LMV2, LM (in quotes).\n\n     Local == Check local account.\n     Domain == Check credentials against this hosts primary\n          domain controller via this host.\n     Hash == Use a NTLM hash rather than a password.\n     Machine == Use the Machine's NetBIOS name as the password.\n     NTLMV2, NTLM, LMV2, LM == set the dialect\n\n   Be careful of mass domain account lockout with this. For\n   example, assume you are checking several accounts against\n   many domain workstations. If you are not using the 'L'\n   options and these accounts do not exist locally on the\n   workstations, each workstation will in turn check their\n   respective domain controller. This could cause a bunch of\n   lockouts. Of course, it'd look like the workstations, not\n   you, were doing it. ;)\n\n   **FYI, this code is unable to test accounts on default XP\n   hosts which are not part of a domain and do not have normal\n   file sharing enabled. Default XP does not allow shares and\n   returns STATUS_LOGON_FAILED for both valid and invalid\n   credentials. XP with simple sharing enabled returns SUCCESS\n   for both valid and invalid credentials. If anyone knows a\n   way to test in these configurations...\n\n*/\n\n#define WIN2000_NATIVEMODE 1\n#define WIN_NETBIOSMODE 2\n\n#define PLAINTEXT 10\n#define ENCRYPTED 11\n\n#ifndef CHAR_BIT\n#define CHAR_BIT 8\n#endif\n\n#ifndef TIME_T_MIN\n#define TIME_T_MIN ((time_t)0 < (time_t)-1 ?

New modules are easy to add, beside that, it is flexible and\nvery fast.\n.LP\nThis tool gives researchers and security consultants the possibility to\nshow how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access from remote to a\nsystem.\n.TP\nCurrently this tool supports:\nadam6500 afp asterisk cisco cisco-enable cvs firebird ftp ftps\nhttp[s]-{head|get|post} http[s]-{get|post}-form http-proxy\nhttp-proxy-urlenum icq imap[s] irc ldap2[s]\nldap3[-{cram|digest}md5][s] mssql mysql(v4) mysql5 ncp nntp\noracle oracle-listener oracle-sid pcanywhere pcnfs pop3[s]\npostgres rdp radmin2 redis rexec rlogin rpcap rsh rtsp s7-300 sapr3 sip\nsmb smtp[s] smtp-enum snmp socks5 ssh sshkey svn teamspeak telnet[s]\nvmauthd vnc xmpp\n.LP\nFor most protocols SSL is supported (e.g. https-get, ftp-ssl, etc.).\nIf not all necessary libraries are found during compile time, your\navailable services will be less.\nType \"hydra\" to see what is available.\n.SH Options\n.TP\n.B target\na target to attack, can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address or DNS name.\n.TP\n.B service\na service to attack, see the list of protocols available\n.TP\n.B OPTIONAL SERVICE PARAMETER\nSome modules have optional or mandatory options. type \"hydra \\-U <servicename>\"\n to get help on on the options of a service.\n.TP\n.B \\-R \nrestore a previously aborted session. Requires a hydra.restore file was\nwritten. Options are restored, but can be changed by setting them after\n\\-R on the command line\n.TP\n.B \\-S\nconnect via SSL\n.TP\n.TP\n.B \\-O\nuse old SSL v2 and v3\n.TP\n.B \\-s PORT\nif the service is on a different default port, define it here\n.TP\n.B \\-l LOGIN\nor \\-L FILE login with LOGIN name, or load several logins from FILE\n.TP\n.B \\-p PASS\nor \\-P FILE try password PASS, or load several passwords from FILE\n.TP\n.B \\-x min:max:charset\ngenerate passwords from min to max length. charset can contain 1\n for numbers, a for lowcase and A for upcase characters.\n Any other character is added is put to the list. \n   Example: 1:2:a1%.\n   The generated passwords will be of length 1 to 2 and contain\n   lowcase letters, numbers and/or percent signs and dots.\n.TP\n.B \\-y\ndisable use of symbols in \\-x bruteforce, see above\n.TP\n.B \\-e nsr\nadditional checks, \"n\" for null password, \"s\" try login as pass, \"r\" try the reverse login as pass\n.TP\n.B \\-C FILE\ncolon separated \"login:pass\" format, instead of \\-L/\\-P options\n.TP\n.B \\-u\nby default Hydra checks all passwords for one login and then tries the next\nlogin. This option loops around the passwords, so the first password is\ntried on all logins, then the next password.\n.TP\n.B \\-f\nexit after the first found login/password pair (per host if \\-M)\n.TP\n.B \\-F\nexit after the first found login/password pair for any host (for usage with \\-M)\n.TP\n.B \\-M FILE\nserver list for parallel attacks, one entry per line\n.TP\n.B \\-o FILE\nwrite found login/password pairs to FILE instead of stdout\n.TP\n.B \\-b FORMAT\nspecify the format for the \\-o FILE: text(default), json, jsonv1\n.TP\n.B \\-t TASKS\nrun TASKS number of connects in parallel (default: 16)\n.TP\n.B \\-m OPTIONS\nmodule specific options. See hydra -U <module> what options are available.\n.TP\n.B \\-w TIME\ndefines the max wait time in seconds for responses (default: 32)\n.TP\n.B \\-W TIME\ndefines a wait time between each connection a task performs. This usually\nonly makes sense if a low task number is used, .e.g \\-t 1\n.TP\n.B \\-c TIME\nthe wait time in seconds per login attempt over all threads (-t 1 is recommended)\nThis usually only makes sense if a low task number is used, .e.g \\-t 1\n.TP\n.B \\-4 / \\-6 \nprefer IPv4 (default) or IPv6 addresses\n.TP\n.B \\-v / \\-V \nverbose mode / show login+pass combination for each attempt\n.TP\n.B \\-d\ndebug mode\n.TP\n.B \\-I\nignore an existing restore file (don't wait 10 seconds)\n.TP\n.B \\-h, \\-\\-help\nShow summary of options.\n.SH SEE ALSO\n.BR xhydra (1),\n.BR pw-inspector (1).\n.br\nThe programs are documented fully by van Hauser <vh@thc.org>\n.SH AUTHOR\nhydra was written by van Hauser / THC <vh@thc.org>\nFind new versions or report bugs at https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra\n.PP\nThis manual page was written by Daniel Echeverry <epsilon77@gmail.com>,\nfor the Debian project (and may be used by others).\n"

I have\n> looked at it, and I would have thought that you might make a distinction\n> between LE and BE machines, but you only seem to distinguish between 386\n> and all other architectures.\n>\n> Can you give me a clue?\n\nsure.\n\nThe distinction between 386 and other architectures is only there as\nan optimisation. You can take it out completely and it will make no\ndifference. The routines (macros) in byteorder.h are totally byteorder\nindependent. The 386 optimsation just takes advantage of the fact that\nthe x86 processors don't care about alignment, so we don't have to\nalign ints on int32_t boundaries etc. If there are other processors out\nthere that aren't alignment sensitive then you could also define\nCAREFUL_ALIGNMENT=0 on those processors as well.\n\nOk, now to the macros themselves. I'll take a simple example, say we\nwant to extract a 2 byte integer from a SMB packet and put it into a\ntype called uint16 that is in the local machines byte order, and you\nwant to do it with only the assumption that uint16 is _at_least_ 16\nbits long (this last condition is very important for architectures\nthat don't have any int32_t types that are 2 bytes long)\n\nYou do this:\n\n#define CVAL(buf,pos) (((unsigned char *)(buf))[pos])\n#define PVAL(buf,pos) ((unsigned)CVAL(buf,pos))\n#define SVAL(buf,pos) (PVAL(buf,pos)|PVAL(buf,(pos)+1)<<8)\n\nthen to extract a uint16 value at offset 25 in a buffer you do this:\n\nchar *buffer = foo_bar();\nuint16 xx = SVAL(buffer,25);\n\nWe are using the byteoder independence of the ANSI C bitshifts to do\nthe work. A good optimising compiler should turn this into efficient\ncode, especially if it happens to have the right byteorder :-)\n\nI know these macros can be made a bit tidier by removing some of the\ncasts, but you need to look at byteorder.h as a whole to see the\nreasoning behind them. byteorder.h defines the following macros:\n\nSVAL(buf,pos) - extract a 2 byte SMB value\nIVAL(buf,pos) - extract a 4 byte SMB value\nSVALS(buf,pos) signed version of SVAL()\nIVALS(buf,pos) signed version of IVAL()\n\nSSVAL(buf,pos,val) - put a 2 byte SMB value into a buffer\nSIVAL(buf,pos,val) - put a 4 byte SMB value into a buffer\nSSVALS(buf,pos,val) - signed version of SSVAL()\nSIVALS(buf,pos,val) - signed version of SIVAL()\n\nRSVAL(buf,pos) - like SVAL() but for NMB byte ordering\nRSVALS(buf,pos) - like SVALS() but for NMB byte ordering\nRIVAL(buf,pos) - like IVAL() but for NMB byte ordering\nRIVALS(buf,pos) - like IVALS() but for NMB byte ordering\nRSSVAL(buf,pos,val) - like SSVAL() but for NMB ordering\nRSIVAL(buf,pos,val) - like SIVAL() but for NMB ordering\nRSIVALS(buf,pos,val) - like SIVALS() but for NMB ordering\n\nit also defines lots of intermediate macros, just ignore those :-)\n\n*/\n\n/* some switch macros that do both store and read to and from SMB buffers */\n\n#define RW_PCVAL(read, inbuf, outbuf, len)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\n  {                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\\n    if (read) {                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\n      PCVAL(inbuf, 0, outbuf, len);
