By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"

          "content": "ProxyChains-NG ver 4.17 README\n=============================\n\n  ProxyChains is a UNIX program, that hooks network-related libc functions\n  in DYNAMICALLY LINKED programs via a preloaded DLL (dlsym(), LD_PRELOAD)\n  and redirects the connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies.\n  It supports TCP only (no UDP/ICMP etc).\n\n  The way it works is basically a HACK; so it is possible that it doesn't\n  work with your program, especially when it's a script, or starts\n  numerous processes like background daemons or uses dlopen() to load\n  \"modules\" (bug in glibc dynlinker).\n  It should work with simple compiled (C/C++) dynamically linked programs\n  though.\n\n  If your program doesn't work with proxychains, consider using an\n  iptables based solution instead; this is much more robust.\n\n  Supported Platforms: Linux, BSD, Mac, Haiku.\n\n\n*********** ATTENTION ***********\n\n  this program can be used to circumvent censorship.\n  doing so can be VERY DANGEROUS in certain countries.\n\n  ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT PROXYCHAINS WORKS AS EXPECTED\n  BEFORE USING IT FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.\n\n  this involves both the program and the proxy that you're going to\n  use.\n\n  for example, you can connect to some \"what is my ip\" service\n  like ifconfig.me to make sure that it's not using your real ip.\n\n  ONLY USE PROXYCHAINS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.\n\n  THE AUTHORS AND MAINTAINERS OF PROXYCHAINS DO NOT TAKE ANY\n  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ABUSE OR MISUSE OF THIS SOFTWARE AND\n  THE RESULTING CONSEQUENCES.\n\n*** Installation ***\n\n  # needs a working C compiler, preferably gcc\n  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc\n  make\n  [optional] sudo make install\n  [optional] sudo make install-config (installs proxychains.conf)\n\n  if you dont install, you can use proxychains from the build directory\n  like this: ./proxychains4 -f src/proxychains.conf telnet google.com 80\n\nChangelog:\n----------\nVersion 4.17\n- add hook for close_range function, fixing newer versions of openssh\n- fat-binary-m1 option for mac\n- fix DNS error handling in proxy_dns_old\n- simplify init code\n- fix openbsd preloading\n- fix double-close in multithreaded apps\n- various improvements to configure script\n\nVersion 4.16\n- fix regression in configure script linker flag detection\n- remove 10 year old workaround for wrong glibc getnameinfo signature\n- support for new DYLD hooking method for OSX Monterey\n- netbsd compilation fix\n- support IPv6 localnets\n- more user-friendly error message when execvp fails\n- proxy_getaddrinfo(): fill in ai_socktype if requested\n\nVersion 4.15\n- fix configure script for buggy binutils version\n- initialize rand_seed with nano-second granularity\n- add support for numeric ipv6 in getaddrinfo\n- fix bug in getaddrinfo when node is null and !passive\n- add dnat feature\n- add raw proxy type\n- add haiku support\n- add proxy_dns_old to emulate proxychains 3.1 behaviour\n- add new proxy_dns_daemon feature (experimental)\n- various other fixes\n\nVersion 4.14\n- allow alternative proto://user:pass@ip:port syntax for proxylist\n- fix endless loop in round robin mode when all proxies are down (#147)\n- fix compilation on android (#265)\n- fix fd leak in forked processes (#273)\n- skip connection attempt to nullrouted ips\n- allow hostnames for proxylist under specific circumstances\n\nVersion 4.13\n- fix robustness of DNS lookup thread and a segfault\n- fix socks5 user/pass auth on non-conforming servers\n- fix memory leak\n- add support for Solaris\n\nVersion 4.12\n- fix several build issues\n  - for MAC\n  - with -pie\n  - with custom CC\n- compatibility fix for some GUI apps (8870140)\n- compatibility fix for some HTTP proxies (cf9a16d)\n- fix several warnings for cleaner build on debian\n- fix random_chain on OSX (0f6b226)\n\nVersion 4.11\n- preliminary IPv6 support\n- fixed bug in hostsreader\n- preliminary support for usage on OpenBSD (caveat emptor)\n\nVersion 4.10\n- fix regression in linking order with custom LDFLAGS\n- fix segfault in DNS mapping code in programs with > ~400 different lookups\n\nVersion 4.9\n- fix a security issue CVE-2015-3887\n- add sendto hook to handle MSG_FASTOPEN flag\n- replace problematic hostentdb with hostsreader\n- fix compilation on OpenBSD (although doesn't work there)\n\nVersion 4.8.1:\n- fix regression in 4.8 install-config Makefile target\n\nVersion 4.8:\n- fix for odd cornercase where getaddrinfo was used with AI_NUMERICHOST\n  to test for a numeric ip instead of resolving it (fixes nmap).\n- allow usage with programs that rely on LD_PRELOAD themselves\n- reject wrong entries in config file\n- print version number on startup\n\nVersion 4.7:\n- new round_robin chaintype by crass.\n- fix bug with lazy allocation when GCC constructor was not used.\n- new configure flag --fat-binary to create a \"fat\" binary/library on OS X\n- return EBADF rather than EINTR in close hook.\n  it's legal for a program to retry close() calls when they receive\n  EINTR, which could cause an infinite loop, as seen in chromium.\n\nVersion 4.6:\n- some cosmetic fixes to Makefile, fix a bug when non-numeric ip was\n  used as proxy server address.\n\nVersion 4.5:\n- hook close() to prevent OpenSSH from messing with internal infrastructure.\n  this caused ssh client to segfault when proxified.\n\nVersion 4.4:\n- FreeBSD port\n- fixes some installation issues on Debian and Mac.\n\nVersion 4.3:\n- fixes programs that do dns-lookups in child processes (fork()ed),\n  like irssi. to achieve this, support for compilation without pthreads\n  was sacrified.\n- fixes thread safety for gethostent() calls.\n- improved DNS handling speed, since hostent db is cached.\n\nVersion 4.2:\n- fixes compilation issues with ubuntu 12.04 toolchain\n- fixes segfault in rare codepath\n\nVersion 4.1\n- support for mac os x (all archs)\n- all internal functions are threadsafe when compiled with -DTHREAD_SAFE\n  (default).\n\nVersion 4.0\n- replaced dnsresolver script (which required a dynamically linked \"dig\"\n  binary to be present) with remote DNS lookup.\n  this speeds up any operation involving DNS, as the old script had to use TCP.\n  additionally it allows to use .onion urls when used with TOR.\n- removed broken autoconf build system with a simple Makefile.\n  there's a ./configure script though for convenience.\n  it also adds support for a config file passed via command line switches/\n  environment variables.\n\nVersion 3.0\n- support for DNS resolving through proxy\n  supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT proxy servers.\n  Auth-types: socks - \"user/pass\" , http - \"basic\".\n\nWhen to use it ?\n1) When the only way to get \"outside\" from your LAN is through proxy server.\n2) To get out from behind restrictive firewall which filters outgoing ports.\n3) To use two (or more) proxies in chain:\n\tlike: your_host <--> proxy1 <--> proxy2 <--> target_host\n4) To \"proxify\" some program with no proxy support built-in (like telnet)\n5) Access intranet from outside via proxy.\n6) To use DNS behind proxy.\n7) To access hidden tor onion services.\n\nSome cool features:\n\n* This program can mix different proxy types in the same chain\n\tlike: your_host <-->socks5 <--> http <--> socks4 <--> target_host\n* Different chaining options supported\n\trandom order from the list ( user defined length of chain ).\n\texact order  (as they appear in the list )\n\tdynamic order (smart exclude dead proxies from chain)\n* You can use it with most TCP client applications, possibly even network\n\tscanners, as long as they use standard libc functionality.\n\tpcap based scanning does not work.\n* You can use it with servers, like squid, sendmail, or whatever.\n* DNS resolving through proxy.\n\n\nConfiguration:\n--------------\n\nproxychains looks for config file in following order:\n1)\tfile listed in environment variable PROXYCHAINS_CONF_FILE or\n\tprovided as a -f argument to proxychains script or binary.\n2)\t./proxychains.conf\n3)\t$(HOME)/.proxychains/proxychains.conf\n4)\t$(sysconfdir)/proxychains.conf  **\n\n** usually /etc/proxychains.conf\n\nUsage Example:\n\n\t$ proxychains telnet targethost.com\n\nin this example it will run telnet through proxy(or chained proxies)\nspecified by proxychains.conf\n\nUsage Example:\n\n\t$ proxychains -f /etc/proxychains-other.conf telnet targethost2.com\n\nin this example it will use different configuration file then proxychains.conf\nto connect to targethost2.com host.\n\nUsage Example:\n\n\t$ proxyresolv targethost.com\n\nin this example it will resolve targethost.com through proxy(or chained proxies)\nspecified by proxychains.conf\n\nKnown Problems:\n---------------\n- newer versions of nmap try to determine the network interface to use\n  even if it's not needed (like when doing simple syn scans which use the\n  standard POSIX socket API. this results in errors when proxychains hands\n  out an ip address to a reserved address space.\n  possible workarounds: disable proxy_dns, use a numeric ip, or use nmap's\n  native support for SOCKS proxies.\n\n- Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) ships with a new security feature called SIP\n  that prevents hooking of system apps.\n  workarounds are to partially disable SIP by issuing\n  csrutil enable --without debug in recovery mode,\n  or to copy the system binary into the home directory and run it from there.\n  see github issue #78 for details.\n\n- the glibc dynlinker has a bug or security feature that inhibits dlopen()ed\n  modules from being subject to the same dlsym hooks as installed for the main\n  program. this mainly affects scripting languages such as perl or python\n  that heavily rely on dlopen() for modules written in C to work.\n  there are unconfirmed reports that it works as root though.\n  musl libc is unaffected from the bug.\n\n\nCommunity:\n----------\n#proxychains on irc.libera.chat\n\nDonations:\n----------\nbitcoins donations are welcome -
