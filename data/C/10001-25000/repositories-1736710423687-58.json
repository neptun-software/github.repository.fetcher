Change: the \"421 Misdirected Request\" response now used when\n       rejecting requests to a virtual server different from one negotiated\n       during an SSL handshake; this improves interoperability with some\n       HTTP/2 clients when using client certificates.\n\n    *) Change: HTTP/2 clients can now start sending request body\n       immediately; the \"http2_body_preread_size\" directive controls size of\n       the buffer used before nginx will start reading client request body.\n\n    *) Bugfix: cached error responses were not updated when using the\n       \"proxy_cache_bypass\" directive.\n\n\nChanges with nginx 1.9.15                                        19 Apr 2016\n\n    *) Bugfix: \"recv() failed\" errors might occur when using HHVM

Feature: the ngx_http_perl_module can be built dynamically.\n\n    *) Feature: UDP support in the stream module.\n\n    *) Feature: the \"aio_write\" directive.\n\n    *) Feature: now cache manager monitors number of elements in caches and\n       tries to avoid cache keys zone overflows.\n\n    *) Bugfix: \"task already active\" and \"second aio post\" alerts might\n       appear in logs when using the \"sendfile\" and \"aio\" directives with\n       subrequests.\n\n    *) Bugfix: \"zero size buf in output\" alerts might appear in logs if\n       caching was used and a client closed a connection prematurely.\n\n    *) Bugfix: connections with clients might be closed needlessly if\n       caching was used.\n       Thanks to Justin Li.\n\n    *) Bugfix: nginx might hog CPU if the \"sendfile\" directive was used on\n       Linux or Solaris and a file being sent was changed during sending.\n\n    *) Bugfix: connections might hang when using the \"sendfile\" and \"aio\n       threads\" directives.\n\n    *) Bugfix: in the \"proxy_pass\", \"fastcgi_pass\", \"scgi_pass\", and\n       \"uwsgi_pass\" directives when using variables.\n       Thanks to Piotr Sikora.\n\n    *) Bugfix: in the ngx_http_sub_filter_module.\n\n    *) Bugfix: if an error occurred in a cached backend connection, the\n       request was passed to the next server regardless of the\n       proxy_next_upstream directive.\n\n    *) Bugfix: \"CreateFile() failed\" errors when creating temporary files on\n       Windows.\n\n\nChanges with nginx 1.9.12

pointer dereference might occur during DNS server\n       response processing if the \"resolver\" directive was used, allowing an\n       attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to\n       cause segmentation fault in a worker process (CVE-2016-0742).\n\n    *) Security: use-after-free condition might occur during CNAME response\n       processing if the \"resolver\" directive was used, allowing an attacker\n       who is able to trigger name resolution to cause segmentation fault in\n       a worker process, or might have potential other impact\n       (CVE-2016-0746).\n\n    *) Security: CNAME resolution was insufficiently limited if the\n       \"resolver\" directive was used, allowing an attacker who is able to\n       trigger arbitrary name resolution to cause

It is based on the [Nginx](http://nginx.org) HTTP server and has many advanced features. Tengine has proven to be very stable and efficient on some of the top 100 websites in the world, including [taobao.com](http://www.taobao.com) and [tmall.com](http://www.tmall.com).\n\nTengine has been an open source project since December 2011. It is being actively developed by the Tengine team, whose core members are from Taobao, Sogou and other Internet companies. Tengine is a community effort and everyone is encouraged to [get involved](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine).\n\n## Features\n* All features of nginx-1.24.0 are inherited, i.e., it is 100% compatible with nginx.\n* Dynamically configure the servers, locations and upstreams without reloading or restarting worker processes with [tengine-ingress](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine-ingress).\n* HTTP/3 support (QUIC v1 and draft-29) with [xquic](https://github.com/alibaba/xquic).\n* High-speed UDP transmission with kernel-bypass.\n* Dynamically configure different TLS protocols for different server names with [tengine-ingress](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine-ingress).\n* Dynamically configure timeout setting, SSL Redirects, CORS and enabling/disabling robots for the server and location with [tengine-ingress](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine-ingress).\n* Dynamically configure HTTP routing based on multiple values of a specific header, cookie or query parameter with [tengine-ingress](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine-ingress).\n* Dynamically configure HTTP routing based on multiple upstream according to weight with [tengine-ingress](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine-ingress).\n* Dynamically configure HTTP routing based on modulo operation for a specific header, cookie or query parameter with [tengine-ingress](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine-ingress).\n* Dynamically configure HTTP routing to add/append custom header or add query parameter in the HTTP request to the upstream with [tengine-ingress](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine-ingress).\n* Dynamically configure HTTP routing to add custom header in the HTTP response to the client with [tengine-ingress](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine-ingress).\n* Support the CONNECT HTTP method for forward proxy.\n* Support asynchronous OpenSSL, using hardware such as QAT for HTTPS acceleration.\n* Enhanced operations monitoring, such as asynchronous log & rollback, DNS caching, memory usage, etc.\n* Support server_name in Stream module.\n* More load balancing methods, e.g., consistent hashing, and session persistence.\n* Input body filter support. It's quite handy to write Web Application Firewalls using this mechanism.\n* Dynamic scripting language (Lua) support, which is very efficient and makes it easy to extend core functionalities.\n* Limits retries for upstream servers (proxy, memcached, fastcgi, scgi, uwsgi).\n* Includes a mechanism to support standalone processes.\n* Protects the server in case system load or memory use goes too high.\n* Multiple CSS or JavaScript requests can be combined into one request to reduce download time.\n* Removes unnecessary white spaces and comments to reduce the size of a page.\n* Proactive health checks of upstream servers can be performed.\n* The number of worker processes and CPU affinities can be set automatically.\n* The limit_req module is enhanced with whitelist support and more conditions are allowed in a single location.\n* Enhanced diagnostic information makes it easier to troubleshoot errors.\n* More user-friendly command lines, e.g., showing all compiled-in modules and supported directives.\n* Expiration times can be specified for certain MIME types.\n* Receives HTTP traffic on the TLS listener with option.\n* Debugging HTTP connection usage.\n* ...\n\n## Installation\nTengine can be downloaded at [http://tengine.taobao.org/download/tengine.tar.gz](http://tengine.taobao.org/download/tengine.tar.gz). You can also checkout the latest source code from GitHub at [https://github.com/alibaba/tengine](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine)\n\nTo install Tengine, just follow these three steps:\n```bash\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nBy default, it will be installed to _/usr/local/nginx_. You can use the __'--prefix'__ option to specify the root directory.\nIf you want to know all the _'configure'_ options, you should run __'./configure --help'__ for help.\n\n## Documentation\nThe homepage of Tengine is at [http://tengine.taobao.org/](http://tengine.taobao.org/)\nYou can access [http://tengine.taobao.org/documentation.html](http://tengine.taobao.org/documentation.html) for more information.\n\n## Contact\n[https://github.com/alibaba/tengine/issues](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine/issues)\n\nDingtalk user group: 23394285\n\n## License\n\n[BSD-2-Clause License](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n<h1 align=\"center\" style=\"border-bottom: none\">\n    <a href=\"https://tengine.taobao.org\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Tengine\" src=\"/docs/image/tengine-logo.png\"></a>\n</h1>\n"
