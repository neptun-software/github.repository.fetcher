Note: this fundamentally changes the mechanism Sbie uses for token creation, the new mechanism can be enabled separately with \"UseCreateToken=y\"\n- added \"EditAdminOnly=y\" can now be configured per box\n- added UI for CoverBoxedWindows in NewBoxWizard\n- added UI option to start unsandboxed process but force child processes in SelectBoxWindow\n- added option \"AlertBeforeStart\"\n  - when it is set, a prompt pops up before launching a new program into the sandbox using \"Start.exe\" and checks if the program that started \"Start.exe\" is a Sandboxie component itself, if it is not, a warning pops up\n- added option for EditAdminOnly in SetupWizard\n\n### Changed\n- split the advanced new box wizard to stretch over two pages\n- reorganized box options\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed issue with proxy authentication setting\n- fixed memory leak in SbieSvc\n- fixed issue with inconsistent WFP option application [#3900](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/3900)\n- fixed resource leak in buffer hashing function\n- fixed DLL name corruption when BlockInterferenceControl is enabled [#3945](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/3945)\n- fixed issue with driver verifier\n\n\n\n## [1.14.0 / 5.69.0] -

use \"ProcessNumberLimit\" (number) to set process number limit\n- added ability to adjust the logic speed of sandboxed processes, including reduced fixed latency and modified single-player speed (thanks Yeyixiao)\n  - Note: you can set \"UseChangeSpeed=y\" to configure the following options: \"AddTickSpeed\", \"AddSleepSpeed\", \"AddTimerSpeed\", \"LowTickSpeed\", \"LowSleepSpeed\" and \"LowTimerSpeed\" (integer values only)\n  - Note: these options use multiples instead of adding or subtracting; the \"Add\" series is configured by multiplication, while the \"Low\" series by division\n  - Note: when set to \"AddSleepSpeed=0\", all sleep function calls will be skipped. For example, you can bypass fixed delay code in hidden malware, reducing analysis time without affecting essential operations, which is useful for virus analysts\n- added /fcp /force_children command line option to Start.exe; it allows to start a program unsandboxed but have all its children sandboxed\n- added ability to force sandboxed processes to use a pre-defined SOCKS5 proxy\n- added ability to intercept DNS queries so that they can be logged and/or redirected\n- added support for SOCKS5 proxy authentication based on RFC1928 (thanks Deezzir)\n- added test dialog UI for SOCKS5 proxy (thanks Deezzir)\n- added ability to automatically remove template references that begin with \"Template_Temp_\"\n\n### Changed\n- validated compatibility with Windows build 26217 and updated DynData\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed an issue with an early batch of Large Supporter certificates\n\n\n\n## [1.13.7 / 5.68.7] -

the program image must be located outside the sandbox for this to work\n  - if another sandbox has \"ForceProcess=program.exe\" configured, it will capture the process\n  - use case: set up a box with a Web browser forced, when another box opens a website, this will happen in the dedicated browser box\n  - Note: \"BreakoutFolder=some\\path\" is also available\n- added silent uninstall switch `/remove /S` for Classic installer (by sredna) [#1532](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/pull/1532)\n\n### Changed\n- the filename \"sandman_pt\" was changed to \"sandman_pt_BR\" (Brazilian Portuguese) [#1497](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/pull/1497)\n- the filename \"sandman_ua\" was changed to \"sandman_uk\" (Ukrainian) [#1527](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1527)\n  -

you can force the installation of other hooks by specifying them with \"EnableWin32Hook=...\"\n  - or disable the installation of the default hooks with \"DisableWin32Hook=...\"\n  - please note that some Win32k hooks may cause BSODs or undefined behaviour (!)\n  - the most obviously problematic Win32k hooks are blacklisted, this can be bypassed with \"IgnoreWin32HookBlacklist=y\"\n- added debug option \"AdjustBoxedSystem=n\" to disable the adjustment of service ACLs running with a system token\n- added \"NoUACProxy=y\" option together with the accompanying template, in order to disable UAC proxy\n  - Note: boxes configured in compartment mode activate this template by default\n- added UI option to change default RpcMgmtSetComTimeout preset\n- added Plus installer option to start the default browser under Sandboxie through a desktop shortcut\n- added more entries to the Plus installer (current translations on [Languages.iss](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/blob/master/Installer/Languages.iss) file need to be updated)\n\n### Changed\n- \"EnableWin32kHooks=y\" is now enabled by default, as no issues were reported in 1.0.3\n  -

2021-12-12\n\n### Added\n- added mechanism to hook Win32k system calls on Windows 10 and later, this should resolve the issue with Chromium HW acceleration\n  - Note: this mechanism does not, yet, work for 32-bit applications running under WoW64\n  - to enable it, add \"EnableWin32kHooks=y\" to the global ini section, this feature is highly experimental (!)\n  - the hooks will be automatically applied to Chromium GPU processes\n  - to force Win32k hooks for all processes in a selected box, add \"AlwaysUseWin32kHooks=program.exe,y\" [#1261](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1261) [#1395](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1395)\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed bug in GetVersionExW making \"OverrideOsBuild=...\" not working [#605](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/605) [#1426](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1426)\n- fixed issue with some UTF-8 characters when used in the ini file\n- fixed isolation issue with Virtual Network Editor [#1102](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1102)\n\n\n\n## [1.0.2 / 5.55.2] -

2021-11-17\n\n### Added\n- added Privacy Enhanced mode, sandboxes with \"UsePrivacyMode=y\" will not allow read access to locations containing user data\n  - all locations except generic Windows system paths will need to be opened explicitly for read and/or write access\n  - using \"NormalFilePath=...\", \"NormalKeyPath=...\", \"NormalIpcPath=...\" allows to open locations to be readable and sandboxed\n- added new Application Compartment mode of operation, it is enabled by adding \"NoSecurityIsolation=y\" to the sandbox config\n  - in this mode, security is traded in for compatibility, it should not be used for untrusted applications\n  - Note: in this mode, file and registry filtering are still in place, hence processes run without administrative privileges\n  - it is reasonably safe, all filtering can be disabled with \"NoSecurityFiltering=y\"\n- added experimental use of ObRegisterCallbacks to filter object creation and duplication\n  - this filtering is independent from the regular SbieDrv's syscall-based filtering, hence it also applies to Application Compartments\n  - with it enabled, an application running in a compartment will not be able to manipulate processes running outside the sandbox\n  - Note: this feature improves the security of non-isolated Application Compartment sandboxes\n  - to enable this feature, set \"EnableObjectFiltering=y\" in the global section and reload the driver\n  - when globally activated, the filtering can be disabled for individual boxes with \"DisableObjectFilter=y\"\n- added \"DontOpenForBoxed=n\", this option disables the discrimination of boxed processes for open file and open key directives\n  - this behaviour does not really improve security anyway, but may be annoying, also Application Compartments always disable this\n- added setting to entirely open access to the COM infrastructure\n\n### Changed\n- reworked the resource access path matching mechanism to optionally apply more specific rules over less specific ones\n  - for example \"OpenFilePath=C:\\User\\Me\\AppData\\Firefox takes precedence over \"WriteFilePath=C:\\User\\Me\\\"\n  - to enable this new behaviour, add \"UseRuleSpecificity=y\" to your Sandboxie.ini, this behaviour is always enabled in Privacy Enhanced mode\n  - added \"NormalFilePath=...\" to restore default Sandboxie behaviour on a given path\n  - added \"OpenConfPath=...\", which similarly to \"OpenPipePath=...\" is a \"OpenKeyPath=...\" variant which applies to executables located in the sandbox\n- removed option to copy a box during creation, instead the box context menu offers a duplication option\n- reworked the box creation dialog to offer new box types\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed SBIE1401 notification during Sandboxie Plus uninstall (by mpheath) [68fa37d](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/commit/68fa37d45be2be3565917d0de097709b7aa009e0)\n- fixed memory leak in driver handling FLT_FILE_NAME_INFORMATION (by Therzok) [#1371](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/pull/1371)\n\n\n\n## [0.9.8d / 5.53.3] - 2021-11-01\n\n### Added\n- added checkbox if the user wants SandMan.exe to be started after installation [#1318](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/1318)\n- added template for Windows 10 virtual desktop manager [#1326](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/discussions/1326)\n\n### Changed\n- \"OpenClsid=...\" is no longer restricted to CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER execution contexts only\n  -

2021-07-29 (pre-release)\n\n### Added\n- added support for Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to be used instead of the device-based network blocking scheme\n  - to enable this support, add 'NetworkEnableWFP=y' to the global section and reboot or reload the driver\n  - to use WFP for a specific sandbox, add 'AllowNetworkAccess=n'\n  - you can allow certain processes by using 'AllowNetworkAccess=program.exe,y'\n  - you can also enable this policy globally by adding 'AllowNetworkAccess=n' to the global section\n  - in this case you can exempt entire sandboxes by adding 'AllowNetworkAccess=y' to specific boxes\n  - you can block certain processes by using 'AllowNetworkAccess=program.exe,n'\n  - Note: WFP is less absolute than the old approach, using WFP will filter only TCP/UDP communication\n  - restricted boxed processes will still be able to resolve domain names using the system service\n  - however, they will not be able to send or receive data packets directly\n  - the advantages of WFP is that filter rules can be implemented by restricting communication only to specified addresses or selected ports using \"NetworkAccess=...\"\n- added fully functional rule-based packet filter in user mode for the case when \"NetworkEnableWFP=y\" is not set\n  - the mechanism replaces the old \"BlockPort=...\" functionality\n  - Note: this filter applies only to outgoing connections/traffic, for incoming traffic either the WFP mode or a third-party firewall is needed\n  - like the old user mode based mechanism, malicious applications can bypass it by unhooking certain functions\n  - hence it's recommended to use the kernel mode WFP-based mechanism when reliable isolation is required\n- added new trace option \"NetFwTrace=*\" to trace the actions of the firewall components\n  - please note that the driver only trace logs the kernel debug output, use DbgView.exe to log\n- API_QUERY_PROCESS_INFO can now be used to get the impersonation token of a sandboxed thread\n  - Note: this capability is used by TaskExplorer to allow inspecting sandbox-internal tokens\n  - Note: a process must have administrative privileges to be able to use this API\n- added a UI option to switch \"MsiInstallerExemptions=y\" on and off\n  - just in case a future Windows build breaks something in the systemless mode\n- added sample code for ObRegisterCallbacks to the driver\n- added new debug options \"DisableFileFilter=y\" and \"DisableKeyFilter=y\" that allow to disable file and registry filtering\n  - Note: these options are for testing only and disable core parts of the sandbox isolation\n- added a few command line options to SandMan.exe\n\n### Changed\n- greatly improved the performance of the trace log, but it's no longer possible to log to both SandMan and SbieCtrl at the same time\n- reworked process creation code to use PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx and improved process termination\n\n### Fixed\n- added missing hook for ConnectEx function\n\n\n\n## [0.8.9 / 5.50.9] - 2021-07-28 HotFix 2\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed issue with registering session leader\n\n\n\n## [0.8.9 / 5.50.9] - 2021-07-28 HotFix 1\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed issue with Windows 7\n\n\n\n## [0.8.9 / 5.50.9] -

code signature is no longer required to change config, to protect presets use the existing \"EditAdminOnly=y\"\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed issue with systemless MSI mode introduced in the last build\n- fixed MSI installer not being able to create the action server mechanism on Windows 11\n- fixed MSI installer not working in systemless mode on Windows 11\n- fixed Inno Setup script not being able to remove shell integration keys during Sandboxie Plus uninstall (by mpheath) [#1037](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/pull/1037)\n\n\n\n## [0.8.8 / 5.50.8] - 2021-07-13\n\n### Changed\n- MSIServer no longer requires being run as system; this completes the move to not use system tokens in a sandbox by default\n  - the security-enhanced option \"MsiInstallerExemptions=n\" is now the default behaviour\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed issue with the \"explore sandboxed\" command [#972](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/972)\n- rolled back the switch from using NtQueryKey to NtQueryObject as it seems to break some older Windows 10 versions like 1803 [#984](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/984)\n  - this change was introduced to fix [#951](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/951)\n  - to use NtQueryObject the option \"UseObjectNameForKeys=y\" can be added to Sandboxie.ini\n\n\n\n## [0.8.7b / 5.50.7] -

2021-07-10\n\n### Added\n- added option to always auto-pick the DefaultBox [#959](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/959)\n  - when this option is enabled, the normal behaviour with a box selection dialog can be brought up by holding down CTRL\n- added option to hide a sandbox from the \"run in box\" dialog\n  -

Note: this change provides an almost static system call speed of 1.2µs regardless of the running process count\n  - the old list, with 100 programs running required 4.5µs; with 200: 12µs; and with 300: 18µs per syscall\n  - Note: some of the slowdown was also affecting non-sandboxed applications due to how the driver handles certain callbacks\n- replaced the per-process Thread List used by the driver with a much faster Hash Map implementation\n- replaced configuration section list with a hash map to improve configuration performance, and increased line limit to 100000\n  -

i.e. \"InjectDll=\\LogAPI\\i386\\logapi32v.dll\" or \"InjectDll64=\\LogAPI\\amd64\\logapi64v.dll\"\n\n### Fixed\n- IniWatcher did not work in portable mode\n- service path fix broke other services\n- workaround for the MSI installer issue\n\n\n\n## [0.2 / 5.41.0] - 2020-06-08\n\n### Added\n- IniWatcher, the .ini is now reloaded automatically every time it changes\n- added Maintenance menu to the Sandbox menu, allowing to install/uninstall and start/stop Sandboxie driver, service\n- SandMan.exe now is packed with Sbie files and when no Sbie is installed acts as a portable installation\n- added option to clean-up logs\n\n### Changed\n- Sbie driver now first checks the home path for the configuration file Sandboxie.ini before checking SystemRoot\n\n### Fixed\n- FIXED SECURITY ISSUE ID-1: sandboxed processes could obtain a write handle on non sandboxed processes (thanks Diversenok)\n  - this allowed to inject code in non sandboxed processes\n- fixed issue boxed services not starting when the path contained a space\n- NtQueryInformationProcess now returns the proper sandboxed path for sandboxed processes\n\n\n\n## [0.1 / 5.40.2] - 2020-06-01\n\n### Added\n- created a new Qt-based UI named SandMan (Sandboxie Manager)\n- Resource Monitor now shows the PID\n- added basic API call log using updated BSA LogAPI library\n\n### Changed\n- reworked Resource Monitor to work with multiple event consumers\n- reworked log to work with multiple event consumers\n\n\n\n## [5.40.1] -

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying local & mapped drives or the Windows registry. An isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.<br>\n\nSandboxie allows you to create virtually unlimited sandboxes and run them alone or simultaneously to isolate programs from the host and each other, while also allowing you to run as many programs simultaneously in a single box as you wish.\n\n**Note: This is a community fork that took place after the release of the Sandboxie source code and not the official continuation of the previous development (see the [project history](./README.md#-project-history) and [#2926](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues/2926)).**\n\n## ⏬ Download\n\n[Latest Release](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/releases/latest)\n\n## 🚀 Features\n\nSandboxie is available in two editions, Plus and Classic. They both share the same core components, this means they have the same level of security and compatibility.\nWhat's different is the availability of features in the user interface.\n\nSandboxie Plus has a modern Qt-based UI, which supports all new features that have been added since the project went open source:\n\n  * Snapshot Manager - takes a copy of any box in order to be restored when needed\n  * Maintenance mode - allows to uninstall/install/start/stop Sandboxie driver and service when needed\n  * Portable mode - you can run the installer and choose to extract all files to a directory\n  * Additional UI options to block access to Windows components like printer spooler and clipboard\n  * More customization options for Start/Run and Internet access restrictions\n  * Privacy mode sandboxes that protect user data from illegitimate access\n  * Security enhanced sandboxes that restrict the availability of syscalls and endpoints\n  * Global hotkeys to suspend or terminate all boxed processes\n  * A network firewall per sandbox which supports Windows Filtering Platform (WFP)\n  * The list of sandboxes can be searched with the shortcut key Ctrl+F\n  * A search function for Global Settings and Sandbox Options\n  * Ability to import/export sandboxes to and from 7z files\n  * Integration of sandboxes into the Windows Start menu\n  * A browser compatibility wizard to create templates for unsupported browsers\n  * Vintage View mode to reproduce the graphical appearance of Sandboxie Control\n  * A troubleshooting wizard to assist users with their problems\n  * An Add-on manager to extend or add functionality via additional components\n  * Protections of sandboxes against the host, including the prevention of taking screenshots\n  * A trigger system to perform actions, when a sandbox goes through different stages, like initialization, box start, termination or file recovery\n  * Make a process not sandboxed, but its child processes sandboxed\n  * Sandboxing as a unit of control to force programs to automatically use the SOCKS5 proxy\n  * DNS resolution control with sandboxing as control granularity\n  * Limit the number of processes in the sandbox and the total amount of memory space they can occupy, and You can limit the total number of sandboxed processes per box\n  * A completely different token creation mechanism from Sandboxie's pre-open-source version makes sandboxes more independent in the system\n  * Encrypted Sandbox - an AES-based reliable data storage solution\n  * Prevent sandboxed programs from generating unnecessary unique identifier in the normal way\n\nMore features can be spotted by finding the sign `=` through the shortcut key Ctrl+F in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file.\n\nSandboxie Classic has the old no longer developed MFC-based UI, hence it lacks native interface support for Plus features. Although some of the missing features can be configured manually in the Sandboxie.ini configuration file or even replaced with [custom scripts](https://sandboxie-website-archive.github.io/www.sandboxie.com/old-forums/viewforum1a2d1a2d.html?f=22), the Classic edition is not recommended for users who want to explore the latest security options.\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\nA GitHub copy of the [Sandboxie documentation](https://sandboxie-plus.github.io/sandboxie-docs) is currently maintained, although more volunteers are needed to keep it updated with the new changes. It is recommended to also check the following labels to track current issues: [Labels · sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/labels).\n\nA partial archive of the [old Sandboxie forum](https://sandboxie-website-archive.github.io/www.sandboxie.com/old-forums) that was previously maintained by Invincea is still available. If you need to find something specific, it is possible to use the following search query: `site:https://sandboxie-website-archive.github.io/www.sandboxie.com/old-forums/`.\n\n\n## 🚀 Useful tools for Sandboxie\n\nSandboxie's functionality can be enhanced with specialized tools like the following:\n\n  * [LogApiDll](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/LogApiDll) - adds a verbose output to Sandboxie's trace log, listing invocations of relevant Windows API functions\n  * [SbieHide](https://github.com/VeroFess/SbieHide) - attempts to hide the presence of SbieDll.dll from the application being sandboxed\n  * [SandboxToys2](https://github.com/blap/SandboxToys2) - allows to monitor files and registry changes in a sandbox\n  * [Sbiextra](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/sbiextra) - adds additional user mode restrictions to sandboxed processes\n\n\n## 📌 Project history\n\n|      Timeline       |    Maintainer    |\n|        :---         |       :---       |\n| 2004 -

As the software's popularity grows, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that users can access it in their preferred language. Therefore, providing localization options for Sandboxie is not just a thoughtful gesture, but also a necessary step to enhance user experience.\n\nTo achieve this goal, Sandboxie has established a translation program that enables users to volunteer their language skills to translate the software's user interface and documentation. \n\n\n## Available translations\n\n| Language | Classic | Plus | Troubleshooting |\n|-|---------|------|---|\n|Albanian|Yes|No|No|\n|Arabic|Yes|Yes - Oct 23, 2024|No|\n|Bulgarian|Yes|No|No|\n|Croatian|Yes|No|No|\n|Czech|Yes|No|No|\n|Danish|Yes|No|No|\n|Dutch|Yes - Jan 10, 2022|Yes - Feb 18, 2022|No|\n|English|Yes - latest|Yes - latest|Yes - latest|\n|Estonian|Yes|No|No|\n|Farsi|Yes|No|No|\n|Finnish|Yes|No|No|\n|French|Yes - Sep 11, 2023|Yes - Jun 20, 2024|No|\n|German|Yes - Nov 21, 2024|Yes - Nov 22, 2024|Yes - Jun 25, 2024|\n|Greek|Yes|No|No|\n|Hebrew|Yes|No|No|\n|Hungarian|Yes|Yes - Nov 5, 2024|Yes - Nov 5, 2024|\n|Indonesian|Yes|No|No|\n|Italian|Yes - Aug 9, 2023|Yes - Aug 16, 2023|No|\n|Japanese|Yes|Yes - Jan 25, 2024|Yes - Jan 28, 2024|\n|Korean|Yes - May 21, 2024|Yes - Jun 6, 2024|No|\n|Macedonian|Yes|No|No|\n|Polish|Yes|Yes - Apr 27, 2024|No|\n|Portuguese|Yes|Yes - May 30, 2023|No|\n|PortugueseBr|Yes - Feb 14, 2023|Yes - Feb 14, 2023|No|\n|Russian|Yes - Aug 26, 2024|Yes - Aug 26, 2024|Yes - Aug 22, 2024|\n|SimpChinese|Yes - May 20, 2024|Yes - Jun 19, 2024|Yes - Jun 20, 2024|\n|Slovak|Yes|No|No|\n|Spanish|Yes|Yes - Jun 17, 2024|Yes - Jan 5, 2024|\n|Swedish|Yes - Aug 10, 2022|Yes - Apr 25, 2024|Yes - Jun 17, 2024|\n|TradChinese|Yes - Sep 21, 2022|Yes - Apr 22, 2024|No|\n|Turkish|Yes - Jun 9, 2024|Yes - Sep 10, 2024|Yes - Jun 19, 2024|\n|Ukrainian|Yes - Jul 26, 2022|Yes - Jul 26, 2022|No|\n|Vietnamese|No|Yes - Nov 7, 2022|No|\n"
