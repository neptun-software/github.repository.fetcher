[valid=time] [ipv6=on|off] [local=on|off|path]*\n\n**default:** *-*\n\n**context:** *http, stream, server, location*\n\nSimilar to the [`resolver` directive](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#resolver)\nin standard nginx core with additional support for parsing additional resolvers from the `resolv.conf` file\nformat.\n\nWhen `local=on`, the standard path of `/etc/resolv.conf` will be used. You may also specify arbitrary\npath to be used for parsing, for example: `local=/tmp/test.conf`.\n\nWhen `local=off`, parsing will be disabled (this is the default).\n\nThis feature is not available on Windows platforms.\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\nMailing List\n============\n\nYou're very welcome to join the English OpenResty mailing list hosted on Google Groups:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/group/openresty-en\n\nThe Chinese mailing list is here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/group/openresty\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\nReport Bugs\n===========\n\nYou're very welcome to report issues on GitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/openresty/openresty/issues\n\n[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n\nCopyright & License\n===================\n\nThe bundle itself is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2019, Yichun \"agentzh\" Zhang (章亦春) <agentzh@gmail.com>, OpenResty Inc.\n\nThis module is licensed under the terms of the BSD license.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\nmet:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
