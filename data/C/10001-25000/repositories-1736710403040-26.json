TimescaleDB v2.17 is available for PostgreSQL 14, 15, 16, and 17.\n\n* Significant performance improvements for continuous aggregate policies: continuous aggregate refresh is now using\n`merge` instead of deleting old materialized data and re-inserting.\n\n  This update can decrease dramatically the amount of data that must be written on the continuous aggregate in the\n  presence of a small number of changes, reduce the `i/o` cost of refreshing a continuous aggregate, and generate fewer\n  Write-Ahead Logs (`WAL`).\n  Overall, continuous aggregate policies will be more lightweight, use less system resources, and complete faster.\n\n* Increased performance for real-time analytical queries over compressed hypertables:\n  we are excited to introduce additional Single Instruction, Multiple Data (`SIMD`) vectorization optimization to our\n  engine by supporting vectorized execution for queries that group by using the `segment_by` column(s) and\n  aggregate using the basic aggregate functions (`sum`, `count`, `avg`, `min`, `max`).\n\n  Stay tuned for more to come in follow-up releases! Support for grouping on additional columns, filtered aggregation,\n  vectorized expressions, and `time_bucket` is coming soon.\n\n* Improved performance of deletes on compressed hypertables when a large amount of data is affected.\n\n  This improvement speeds up operations that delete whole segments by skipping the decompression step.\n  It is enabled for all deletes that filter by the `segment_by` column(s).\n\n**PostgreSQL 14 deprecation announcement**\n\n  We will continue supporting PostgreSQL 14 until April 2025. Closer to that time, we will announce the specific\n  version of TimescaleDB in which PostgreSQL 14 support will not be included going forward.\n\n**Features**\n* #6882: Allow delete of full segments on compressed chunks without decompression.\n* #7033: Use `merge` statement on continuous aggregates refresh.\n* #7126: Add functions to show the compression information.\n* #7147: Vectorize partial aggregation for `sum(int4)` with grouping on `segment by` columns.\n* #7204: Track additional extensions in telemetry.\n* #7207: Refactor the `decompress_batches_scan` functions for easier maintenance.\n* #7209: Add a function to drop the `osm` chunk.\n* #7275: Add support for the `returning` clause for `merge`.\n* #7200: Vectorize common aggregate functions like `min`, `max`, `sum`, `avg`, `stddev`, `variance` for compressed columns\n  of arithmetic types, when there is grouping on `segment by` columns or no grouping.\n\n**Bug fixes**\n* #7187: Fix the string literal length for the `compressed_data_info` function.\n* #7191: Fix creating default indexes on chunks when migrating the data.\n* #7195: Fix the `segment by` and `order by` checks when dropping a column from a compressed hypertable.\n* #7201: Use the generic extension description when building `apt` and `rpm` loader packages.\n* #7227: Add an index to the `compression_chunk_size` catalog table.\n* #7229: Fix the foreign key constraints where the index and the constraint column order are different.\n* #7230: Do not propagate the foreign key constraints to the `osm` chunk.\n* #7234: Release the cache after accessing the cache entry.\n* #7258: Force English in the `pg_config` command executed by `cmake` to avoid the unexpected building errors.\n* #7270: Fix the memory leak in compressed DML batch filtering.\n* #7286: Fix the index column check while searching for the index.\n* #7290: Add check for null offset for continuous aggregates built on top of continuous aggregates.\n* #7301: Make foreign key behavior for hypertables consistent.\n* #7318: Fix chunk skipping range filtering.\n* #7320: Set the license specific extension comment in the install script.\n\n**Thanks**\n* @MiguelTubio for reporting and fixing the Windows build error.\n* @posuch for reporting the misleading extension description in the generic loader packages.\n* @snyrkill for discovering and reporting the issue with continuous aggregates built on top of continuous aggregates.\n\n## 2.16.1 (2024-08-06)\n\nThis release contains bug fixes since the 2.16.0 release. We recommend\nthat you upgrade at the next available opportunity.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #7182 Fix untier_chunk for hypertables with foreign keys\n\n## 2.16.0 (2024-07-31)\n\nThis release contains significant performance improvements when working with compressed data, extended join\nsupport in continuous aggregates, and the ability to define foreign keys from regular tables towards hypertables.\nWe recommend that you upgrade at the next available opportunity.\n\nIn TimescaleDB v2.16.0 we:\n\n* Introduce multiple performance focused optimizations for data manipulation operations (DML) over compressed chunks.\n\n  Improved upsert performance by more than 100x in some cases and more than 1000x in some update/delete scenarios.\n\n* Add the ability to define chunk skipping indexes on non-partitioning columns of compressed hypertables\n\n  TimescaleDB v2.16.0 extends chunk exclusion to use those skipping (sparse) indexes when queries filter on the relevant columns,\n  and prune chunks that do not include any relevant data for calculating the query response.\n\n* Offer new options for use cases that require foreign keys defined.\n\n  You can now add foreign keys from regular tables towards hypertables. We have also removed\n  some really annoying locks in the reverse direction that blocked access to referenced tables\n  while compression was running.\n\n* Extend Continuous Aggregates to support more types of analytical queries.\n\n  More types of joins are supported, additional equality operators on join clauses, and\n  support for joins between multiple regular tables.\n\n**Highlighted features in this release**\n\n* Improved query performance through chunk exclusion on compressed hypertables.\n\n  You can now define chunk skipping indexes on compressed chunks for any column with one of the following\n  integer data types: `smallint`, `int`, `bigint`, `serial`, `bigserial`, `date`, `timestamp`, `timestamptz`.\n\n  After you call `enable_chunk_skipping` on a column, TimescaleDB tracks the min and max values for\n  that column. TimescaleDB uses that information to exclude chunks for queries that filter on that\n  column, and would not find any data in those chunks.\n\n* Improved upsert performance on compressed hypertables.\n\n  By using index scans to verify constraints during inserts on compressed chunks, TimescaleDB speeds\n  up some ON CONFLICT clauses by more than 100x.\n\n* Improved performance of updates, deletes, and inserts on compressed hypertables.\n\n  By filtering data while accessing the compressed data and before decompressing, TimescaleDB has\n  improved performance for updates and deletes on all types of compressed chunks, as well as inserts\n  into compressed chunks with unique constraints.\n\n  By signaling constraint violations without decompressing, or decompressing only when matching\n  records are found in the case of updates, deletes and upserts, TimescaleDB v2.16.0 speeds\n  up those operations more than 1000x in some update/delete scenarios, and 10x for upserts.\n\n* You can add foreign keys from regular tables to hypertables, with support for all types of cascading options.\n  This is useful for hypertables that partition using sequential IDs, and need to reference those IDs from other tables.\n\n* Lower locking requirements during compression for hypertables with foreign keys\n\n  Advanced foreign key handling removes the need for locking referenced tables when new chunks are compressed.\n  DML is no longer blocked on referenced tables while compression runs on a hypertable.\n\n* Improved support for queries on Continuous Aggregates\n\n  `INNER/LEFT` and `LATERAL` joins are now supported. Plus, you can now join with multiple regular tables,\n  and you can have more than one equality operator on join clauses.\n\n**PostgreSQL 13 support removal announcement**\n\nFollowing the deprecation announcement for PostgreSQL 13 in TimescaleDB v2.13,\nPostgreSQL 13 is no longer supported in TimescaleDB v2.16.\n\nThe Currently supported PostgreSQL major versions are 14, 15 and 16.\n\n**Features**\n* #6880: Add support for the array operators used for compressed DML batch filtering.\n* #6895: Improve the compressed DML expression pushdown.\n* #6897: Add support for replica identity on compressed hypertables.\n* #6918: Remove support for PG13.\n* #6920: Rework compression activity wal markers.\n* #6989: Add support for foreign keys when converting plain tables to hypertables.\n* #7020: Add support for the chunk column statistics tracking.\n* #7048: Add an index scan for INSERT DML decompression.\n* #7075: Reduce decompression on the compressed INSERT.\n* #7101: Reduce decompressions for the compressed UPDATE/DELETE.\n* #7108 Reduce decompressions for INSERTs with UNIQUE constraints\n* #7116 Use DELETE instead of TRUNCATE after compression\n* #7134 Refactor foreign key handling for compressed hypertables\n* #7161 Fix `mergejoin input data is out of order`\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #6987 Fix REASSIGN OWNED BY for background jobs\n* #7018: Fix `search_path` quoting in the compression defaults function.\n* #7046: Prevent locking for compressed tuples.\n* #7055: Fix the `scankey` for `segment by` columns, where the type `constant` is different to `variable`.\n* #7064: Fix the bug in the default `order by` calculation in compression.\n* #7069: Fix the index column name usage.\n* #7074: Fix the bug in the default `segment by` calculation in compression.\n\n**Thanks**\n* @jledentu For reporting a problem with mergejoin input order\n\n\n## 2.15.3 (2024-07-02)\n\nThis release contains bug fixes since the 2.15.2 release.\nBest practice is to upgrade at the next available opportunity.\n\n**Migrating from self-hosted TimescaleDB v2.14.x and earlier**\n\nAfter you run `ALTER EXTENSION`, you must run [this SQL script](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-extras/blob/master/utils/2.15.X-fix_hypertable_foreign_keys.sql).

All queries for a distributed\nhypertable are issued to the access node, but inserted data and queries\nare pushed down across data nodes for greater scale and performance.\n\nMulti-node TimescaleDB can be self managed or, for easier operation,\nlaunched within Timescale's fully-managed cloud services.\n\nThis release also adds:\n\n* Support for user-defined actions, allowing users to define,\n  customize, and schedule automated tasks, which can be run by the\n  built-in jobs scheduling framework now exposed to users.\n* Significant changes to continuous aggregates, which now separate the\n  view creation from the policy.  Users can now refresh individual\n  regions of the continuous aggregate materialized view, or schedule\n  automated refreshing via  policy.\n* Redesigned informational views, including new (and more general)\n  views for information about hypertable's dimensions and chunks,\n  policies and user-defined actions, as well as support for multi-node\n  TimescaleDB.\n* Moving all formerly enterprise features into our Community Edition,\n  and updating Timescale License, which now provides additional (more\n  permissive) rights to users and developers.\n\nSome of the changes above (e.g., continuous aggregates, updated\ninformational views) do introduce breaking changes to APIs and are not\nbackwards compatible. While the update scripts in TimescaleDB 2.0 will\nupgrade databases running TimescaleDB 1.x automatically, some of these\nAPI and feature changes may require changes to clients and/or upstream\nscripts that rely on the previous APIs.  Before upgrading, we recommend\nreviewing upgrade documentation at docs.timescale.com for more details.\n\n**Major Features**\n\nTimescaleDB 2.0 moves the following major features to GA:\n* #1923 Add support for distributed hypertables\n* #2006 Add support for user-defined actions\n* #2125 #2221 Improve Continuous Aggregate API\n* #2084 #2089 #2098 #2417 Redesign informational views\n* #2435 Move enterprise features to community\n* #2437 Update Timescale License\n\n**Previous Release Candidates**\n\n* #2702 Release Candidate 4 (December 2, 2020)\n* #2637 Release Candidate 3 (November 12, 2020)\n* #2554 Release Candidate 2 (October 20, 2020)\n* #2478 Release Candidate 1 (October 1, 2020)\n\n**Minor Features**\n\nSince the last release candidate 4, there are several minor\nimprovements:\n* #2746 Optimize locking for create chunk API\n* #2705 Block tableoid access on distributed hypertable\n* #2730 Do not allow unique index on compressed hypertables\n* #2764 Bootstrap data nodes with versioned extension\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\nSince the last release candidate 4, there are several bugfixes:\n* #2719 Support disabling compression on distributed hypertables\n* #2742 Fix compression status in chunks view for distributed chunks\n* #2751 Fix crash and cancel when adding data node\n* #2763 Fix check constraint on hypertable metadata table\n\n**Thanks**\n\nThanks to all contributors for the TimescaleDB 2.0 release:\n* @airton-neto for reporting a bug in executing some queries with UNION\n* @nshah14285 for reporting an issue with propagating privileges\n* @kalman5 for reporting an issue with renaming constraints\n* @LbaNeXte for reporting a bug in decompression for queries with\n  subqueries\n* @semtexzv for reporting an issue with continuous aggregates on\n  int-based hypertables\n* @mr-ns for reporting an issue with privileges for creating chunks\n* @cloud-rocket for reporting an issue with setting an owner on\n  continuous aggregate\n* @jocrau for reporting a bug during creating an index with transaction\n  per chunk\n* @fvannee for reporting an issue with custom time types\n* @ArtificialPB for reporting a bug in executing queries with\n  conditional ordering on compressed hypertable\n* @dutchgecko for reporting an issue with continuous aggregate datatype\n  handling\n* @lambdaq for suggesting to improve error message in continuous\n  aggregate creation\n* @francesco11112 for reporting memory issue on COPY\n* @Netskeh for reporting bug on time_bucket problem in continuous\n  aggregates\n* @mr-ns for reporting the issue with CTEs on distributed hypertables\n* @akamensky for reporting an issue with recursive cache invalidation\n* @ryanbooz for reporting slow queries with real-time aggregation on\n  continuous aggregates\n* @cevian for reporting an issue with disabling compression on\n  distributed hypertables\n\n## 2.0.0-rc4 (2020-12-02)\n\nThis release candidate contains bugfixes since the previous release\ncandidate, as well as additional minor features.

With 2.0, users can create distributed hypertables across\nmultiple instances of TimescaleDB, configured so that one instance serves\nas an access node and multiple others as data nodes. All queries for a\ndistributed hypertable are issued to the access node, but inserted data\nand queries are pushed down across data nodes for greater scale and\nperformance.\n\nThis release also adds support for user-defined actions allowing users to\ndefine actions that are run by the TimescaleDB automation framework.\n\nIn addition to these major new features, the 2.0 branch introduces _breaking_ changes\nto APIs and existing features, such as continuous aggregates. These changes are not\nbackwards compatible and might require changes to clients and/or scripts that rely on\nthe previous APIs. Please review our updated documentation and do proper testing to\nensure compatibility with your existing applications.\n\nThe noticeable breaking changes in APIs are:\n- Redefined functions for policies\n- A continuous aggregate is now created with `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`\n  instead of `CREATE VIEW` and automated refreshing requires adding a policy\n  via `add_continuous_aggregate_policy`\n- Redesign of informational views, including new (and more general) views for\n  information about policies and user-defined actions\n\nThis release candidate is upgradable, so if you are on a previous release (e.g., 1.7.4)\nyou can upgrade to the release candidate and later expect to be able to upgrade to the\nfinal 2.0 release. However, please carefully consider your compatibility requirements\n_before_ upgrading.\n\n**Major Features**\n* #1923 Add support for distributed hypertables\n* #2006 Add support for user-defined actions\n* #2435 Move enterprise features to community\n* #2437 Update Timescale License\n\n**Minor Features**\n* #2011 Constify TIMESTAMPTZ OP INTERVAL in constraints\n* #2105 Support moving compressed chunks\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1843 Improve handling of \"dropped\" chunks\n* #1886 Change ChunkAppend leader to use worker subplan\n* #2116 Propagate privileges from hypertables to chunks\n* #2263 Fix timestamp overflow in time_bucket optimization\n* #2270 Fix handling of non-reference counted TupleDescs in gapfill\n* #2325 Fix rename constraint/rename index\n* #2370 Fix detection of hypertables in subqueries\n* #2376 Fix caggs width expression handling on int based hypertables\n* #2416 Check insert privileges to create chunk\n* #2428 Allow owner change of continuous aggregate\n* #2436 Propagate grants in continuous aggregates\n\n## 2.0.0-beta6 (2020-09-14)\n\n**For beta releases**, upgrading from an earlier version of the\nextension (including previous beta releases) is not supported.\n\nThis beta release includes breaking changes to APIs. The most\nnotable changes since the beta-5 release are the following, which will\nbe reflected in forthcoming documentation for the 2.0 release.\n\n* Existing information views were reorganized. Retrieving information\nabout sizes and statistics was moved to functions. New views were added\nto expose information, which was previously available only internally.\n* New ability to create custom jobs was added.\n* Continuous aggregate API was redesigned. Its policy creation is separated\nfrom the view creation.\n* compress_chunk_policy and drop_chunk_policy were renamed to compression_policy and\nretention_policy.\n\n## 1.7.4 (2020-09-07)\n\nThis maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.7.3 release. We deem it\nhigh priority for upgrading if TimescaleDB is deployed with replicas (synchronous\nor asynchronous).\n\nIn particular the fixes contained in this maintenance release address an issue with\nrunning queries on compressed hypertables on standby nodes.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #2340 Remove tuple lock on select path\n\n## 1.7.3 (2020-07-27)\n\nThis maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.7.2 release.

We deem it medium\npriority for upgrading.\n\nIn particular the fixes contained in this maintenance release address bugs in continuous\naggregates, drop_chunks and compression.\n\n**Features**\n* #1877 Add support for fast pruning of inlined functions\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1908 Fix drop_chunks with unique constraints when cascade_to_materializations is false\n* #1915 Check for database in extension_current_state\n* #1918 Unify chunk index creation\n* #1932 Change compression locking order\n* #1938 Fix gapfill locf treat_null_as_missing\n* #1982 Check for disabled telemetry earlier\n* #1984 Fix compression bit array left shift count\n* #1997 Add checks for read-only transactions\n* #2002 Reset restoring gucs rather than explicitly setting 'off'\n* #2028 Fix locking in drop_chunks\n* #2031 Enable compression for tables with compound foreign key\n* #2039 Fix segfault in create_trigger_handler\n* #2043 Fix segfault in cagg_update_view_definition\n* #2046 Use index tablespace during chunk creation\n* #2047 Better handling of chunk insert state destruction\n* #2049 Fix handling of PlaceHolderVar in DecompressChunk\n* #2051 Fix tuple concurrently deleted error with multiple continuous aggregates\n\n**Thanks**\n* @akamensky for reporting an issue with telemetry and an issue with drop_chunks\n* @darko408 for reporting an issue with decompression\n* @dmitri191 for reporting an issue with failing background workers\n* @eduardotsj for reporting an issue with indexes not inheriting tablespace settings\n* @fourseventy for reporting an issue with multiple continuous aggregrates\n* @fvannee for contributing optimizations for pruning inlined functions\n* @jflambert for reporting an issue with failing telemetry jobs\n* @nbouscal for reporting an issue with compression jobs locking referenced tables\n* @nicolai6120 for reporting an issue with locf and treat_null_as_missing\n* @nomanor for reporting an issue with expression index with table references\n* @olernov for contributing a fix for compressing tables with compound foreign keys\n* @werjo for reporting an issue with drop_chunks and unique constraints\n\n## 2.0.0-beta5 (2020-06-08)\n\nThis release adds new functionality on distributed hypertables,\nincluding (but not limited to) basic LIMIT pushdown, manual chunk\ncompression, table access methods storage options,  SERIAL columns,\nand altering of the replication factor.\nThis release only supports PG11 and PG12. Thus, PG9.6 and PG10\nare no longer supported.\n\nNote that the 2.0 major release will introduce breaking changes\nto user functions and APIs. In particular, this beta removes the\ncascade parameter from drop_chunks and changes the names of\ncertain GUC parameters. Expect additional breaking changes to be\nintroduced up until the 2.0 release.\n\n**For beta releases**, upgrading from an earlier version of the\nextension (including previous beta releases) is not supported.\n\n**Features**\n\n* #1877 Add support for fast pruning of inlined functions\n* #1922 Cleanup GUC names\n* #1923 Add repartition option on detach/delete_data_node\n* #1923 Allow ALTER TABLE SET on distributed hypertable\n* #1923 Allow SERIAL columns for distributed hypertables\n* #1923 Basic LIMIT push down support\n* #1923 Implement altering replication factor\n* #1923 Support compression on distributed hypertables\n* #1923 Support storage options for distributed hypertables\n* #1941 Change default prefix for distributed tables\n* #1943 Support table access methods for distributed hypertables\n* #1952 Remove cascade option from drop_chunks\n* #1955 Remove support for PG9.6 and PG10\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1915 Check for database in extension_current_state\n* #1918 Unify chunk index creation\n* #1923 Fix insert batch size calculation for prepared statements\n* #1923 Fix port conversion issue in add_data_node\n* #1932 Change compression locking order\n* #1938 Fix gapfill locf treat_null_as_missing\n\n**Thanks**\n* @dmitri191 for reporting an issue with failing background workers\n* @fvannee for optimizing pruning of inlined functions\n* @nbouscal for reporting an issue with compression jobs locking referenced tables\n* @nicolai6120 for reporting an issue with locf and treat_null_as_missing\n* @nomanor for reporting an issue with expression index with table references\n\n## 1.7.1 (2020-05-18)\n\nThis maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.7.0 release. We deem it medium\npriority for upgrading and high priority for users with multiple continuous aggregates.\n\nIn particular the fixes contained in this maintenance release address bugs in continuous\naggregates with real-time aggregation and PostgreSQL 12 support.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1834 Define strerror() for Windows\n* #1846 Fix segfault on COPY to hypertable\n* #1850 Fix scheduler failure due to bad next_start_time for jobs\n* #1851 Fix hypertable expansion for UNION ALL\n* #1854 Fix reorder policy job to skip compressed chunks\n* #1861 Fix qual pushdown for compressed hypertables where quals have casts\n* #1864 Fix issue with subplan selection in parallel ChunkAppend\n* #1868 Add support for WHERE, HAVING clauses with real time aggregates\n* #1869 Fix real time aggregate support for multiple continuous aggregates\n* #1871 Don't rely on timescaledb.restoring for upgrade\n* #1875 Fix hypertable detection in subqueries\n* #1884 Fix crash on SELECT WHERE NOT with empty table\n\n**Thanks**\n* @airton-neto for reporting an issue with queries over UNIONs of hypertables\n* @dhodyn for reporting an issue with UNION ALL queries\n* @frostwind for reporting an issue with casts in where clauses on compressed hypertables\n* @fvannee for reporting an issue with hypertable detection in inlined SQL functions and an issue with COPY\n* @hgiasac for reporting missing where clause with real time aggregates\n* @louisth for reporting an issue with real-time aggregation and multiple continuous aggregates\n* @michael-sayapin for reporting an issue with INSERTs and WHERE NOT EXISTS\n* @olernov for reporting and fixing an issue with compressed chunks in the reorder policy\n* @pehlert for reporting an issue with pg_upgrade\n\n## 1.7.0 (2020-04-16)\n\nThis release adds major new features and bugfixes since the 1.6.1 release.\nWe deem it moderate priority for upgrading.\n\nThis release adds the long-awaited support for PostgreSQL 12 to TimescaleDB.\n\nThis release also adds a new default behavior when querying continuous\naggregates that we call real-time aggregation. A query on a continuous\naggregate will now combine materialized data with recent data that has\nyet to be materialized.\n\nNote that only newly created continuous aggregates will have this\nreal-time query behavior, although it can be enabled on existing\ncontinuous aggregates with a configuration setting as follows:\n\nALTER VIEW continuous_view_name SET (timescaledb.materialized_only=false);\n\nThis release also moves several data management lifecycle features\nto the Community version of TimescaleDB (from Enterprise), including\ndata reordering and data retention policies.\n\n**Major Features**\n* #1456 Add support for PostgreSQL 12\n* #1685 Add support for real-time aggregation on continuous aggregates\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1665 Add ignore_invalidation_older_than to timescaledb_information.continuous_aggregates view\n* #1750 Handle undefined ignore_invalidation_older_than\n* #1757 Restrict watermark to max for continuous aggregates\n* #1769 Add rescan function to CompressChunkDml CustomScan node\n* #1785 Fix last_run_success value in continuous_aggregate_stats view\n* #1801 Include parallel leader in plan execution\n* #1808 Fix ts_hypertable_get_all for compressed tables\n* #1828 Ignore dropped chunks in compressed_chunk_stats\n\n**Licensing changes**\n* Reorder and policies around reorder and drop chunks are now\n  accessible to community users, not just enterprise\n* Gapfill functionality no longer warns about expired license\n\n**Thanks**\n\n* @t0k4rt for reporting an issue with parallel chunk append plans\n* @alxndrdude for reporting an issue when trying to insert into compressed chunks\n* @Olernov for reporting and fixing an issue with show_chunks and drop_chunks for compressed hypertables\n* @mjb512 for reporting an issue with INSERTs in CTEs in cached plans\n* @dmarsh19 for reporting and fixing an issue with dropped chunks in compressed_chunk_stats\n\n## 1.6.1 (2020-03-18)\n\nThis maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.6.0 release. We deem it medium\npriority for upgrading.\n\nIn particular the fixes contained in this maintenance release address bugs in continuous\naggregates, time_bucket_gapfill, partial index handling and drop_chunks.\n\n**For this release only**, you will need to restart the database after upgrade before\nrestoring a backup.\n\n**Minor Features**\n* #1666 Support drop_chunks API for continuous aggregates\n* #1711 Change log level for continuous aggregate materialization messages\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1630 Print notice for COPY TO on hypertable\n* #1648 Drop chunks from materialized hypertable\n* #1668 Cannot add dimension if hypertable has empty chunks\n* #1673 Fix crash when interrupting create_hypertable\n* #1674 Fix time_bucket_gapfill's interaction with GROUP BY\n* #1686 Fix order by queries on compressed hypertables that have char segment by column\n* #1687 Fix issue with disabling compression when foreign keys are present\n* #1688 Handle many BGW jobs better\n* #1698 Add logic to ignore dropped chunks in hypertable_relation_size\n* #1704 Fix bad plan for continuous aggregate materialization\n* #1709 Prevent starting background workers with NOLOGIN\n* #1713 Fix miscellaneous background worker issues\n* #1715 Fix issue with overly aggressive chunk exclusion in outer joins\n* #1719 Fix restoring/scheduler entrypoint to avoid BGW death\n* #1720 Add scheduler cache invalidations\n* #1727 Fix compressing INTERVAL columns\n* #1728 Handle Sort nodes in ConstraintAwareAppend\n* #1730 Fix partial index handling on hypertables\n* #1739 Use release OpenSSL DLLs for debug builds on Windows\n* #1740 Fix invalidation entries from multiple caggs on same hypertable\n* #1743 Fix continuous aggregate materialization timezone handling\n* #1748 Fix remove_drop_chunks_policy for continuous aggregates\n* #1756 Fix handling of dropped chunks in compression background worker\n\n**Thanks**\n* @RJPhillips01 for reporting an issue with drop chunks.\n* @b4eEx for reporting an issue with disabling compression.\n* @darko408 for reporting an issue with order by on compressed hypertables\n* @mrechte for reporting an issue with compressing INTERVAL columns\n* @tstaehli for reporting an issue with ConstraintAwareAppend\n* @chadshowalter for reporting an issue with partial index on hypertables\n* @geoffreybennett for reporting an issue with create_hypertable when interrupting operations\n* @alxndrdude for reporting an issue with background workers during restore\n* @zcavaliero for reporting and fixing an issue with dropped columns in hypertable_relation_size\n* @ismailakpolat for reporting an issue with cagg materialization on hypertables with TIMESTAMP column\n\n## 1.6.0 (2020-01-14)\n\nThis release adds major new features and bugfixes since the 1.5.1 release.\nWe deem it moderate priority for upgrading.\n\nThe major new feature in this release allows users to keep the aggregated\ndata in a continuous aggregate while dropping the raw data with drop_chunks.\nThis allows users to save storage by keeping only the aggregates.\n\nThe semantics of the refresh_lag parameter for continuous aggregates has\nbeen changed to be relative to the current timestamp instead of the maximum\nvalue in the table. This change requires that an integer_now func be set on\nhypertables with integer-based time columns to use continuous aggregates on\nthis table.\n\nWe added a timescaledb.ignore_invalidation_older_than parameter for continuous\naggregates. This parameter accept a time-interval (e.g. 1 month). If set,\nit limits the amount of time for which to process invalidation. Thus, if\ntimescaledb.ignore_invalidation_older_than = '1 month', then any modifications\nfor data older than 1 month from the current timestamp at modification time may\nnot cause continuous aggregate to be updated. This limits the amount of work\nthat a backfill can trigger. By default, all invalidations are processed.\n\n**Major Features**\n* #1589 Allow drop_chunks while keeping continuous aggregates\n\n**Minor Features**\n* #1568 Add ignore_invalidation_older_than option to continuous aggs\n* #1575 Reorder group-by clause for continuous aggregates\n* #1592 Improve continuous agg user messages\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1565 Fix partial select query for continuous aggregate\n* #1591 Fix locf treat_null_as_missing option\n* #1594 Fix error in compression constraint check\n* #1603 Add join info to compressed chunk\n* #1606 Fix constify params during runtime exclusion\n* #1607 Delete compression policy when drop hypertable\n* #1608 Add jobs to timescaledb_information.policy_stats\n* #1609 Fix bug with parent table in decompression\n* #1624 Fix drop_chunks for ApacheOnly\n* #1632 Check for NULL before dereferencing variable\n\n**Thanks**\n* @optijon for reporting an issue with locf treat_null_as_missing option\n* @acarrera42 for reporting an issue with constify params during runtime exclusion\n* @ChristopherZellermann for reporting an issue with the compression constraint check\n* @SimonDelamare for reporting an issue with joining hypertables with compression\n\n## 2.0.0-beta4 (2019-12-19)\n\n**For beta releases**, upgrading from an earlier version of the\nextension (including previous beta releases) is not supported.\n\nThis release includes user experience improvements for managing data\nnodes, more efficient statistics collection for distributed\nhypertables, and miscellaneous fixes and improvements.\n\n## 1.5.1 (2019-11-12)\n\nThis maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.5.0 release. We deem it low\npriority for upgrading.\n\nIn particular the fixes contained in this maintenance release address potential\nsegfaults and no other security vulnerabilities. The bugfixes are related to bloom\nindexes and updates from previous versions.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1523 Fix bad SQL updates from previous updates\n* #1526 Fix hypertable model\n* #1530 Set active snapshots in multi-xact index create\n\n**Thanks**\n* @84660320 for reporting an issue with bloom indexes\n* @gumshoes @perhamm @jermudgeon @gmisagm for reporting the issue with updates\n\n## 2.0.0-beta3 (2019-11-05)\n\n**For beta releases**, upgrading from an earlier version of the\nextension (including previous beta releases) is not supported.\n\nThis release improves performance for queries executed on distributed\nhypertables, fixes minor issues and blocks a number of SQL API\nfunctions, which are not supported on distributed hypertables. It also\nadds information about distributed databases in the telemetry.\n\n## 2.0.0-beta2 (2019-10-22)\n\nThis release introduces *distributed hypertables*, a major new\nfeature that allows hypertables to scale out across multiple nodes for\nincreased performance and fault tolerance. Please review the\ndocumentation to learn how to configure and use distributed\nhypertables and what current limitations are.\n\n## 1.5.0 (2019-10-31)\n\nThis release adds major new features and bugfixes since the 1.4.2 release.\nWe deem it moderate priority for upgrading.\n\nThis release adds compression as a major new feature.\nMultiple type-specific compression options are available in this release\n(including DeltaDelta with run-length-encoding for integers and\ntimestamps; Gorilla compression for floats; dictionary-based compression\nfor any data type, but specifically for low-cardinality datasets;\nand other LZ-based techniques). Individual columns can be compressed with\ntype-specific compression algorithms as Postgres' native row-based format\nare rolled up into columnar-like arrays on a per chunk basis.\nThe query planner then handles transparent decompression for compressed\nchunks at execution time.\n\nThis release also adds support for basic data tiering by supporting\nthe migration of chunks between tablespaces, as well as support for\nparallel query coordination to the ChunkAppend node.\nPreviously ChunkAppend would rely on parallel coordination in the\nunderlying scans for parallel plans.\n\nMore information can be found on [our blog](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-columnar-compression-in-a-row-oriented-database)\nor in this [tutorial](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/tutorials/compression-tutorial)\n\n**For this release only**, you will need to restart the database before running\n`ALTER EXTENSION`\n\n**Major Features**\n* #1393 Moving chunks between different tablespaces\n* #1433 Make ChunkAppend parallel aware\n* #1434 Introducing native compression, multiple compression algorithms, and hybrid row/columnar projections\n\n**Minor Features**\n* #1471 Allow setting reloptions on chunks\n* #1479 Add next_start option to alter_job_schedule\n* #1481 Add last_successful_finish to bgw_job_stats\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1444 Prevent LIMIT pushdown in JOINs\n* #1447 Fix runtime exclusion memory leak\n* #1464 Fix ordered append with expressions in ORDER BY clause with space partitioning\n* #1476 Fix logic for BGW rescheduling\n* #1477 Fix gapfill treat_null_as_missing\n* #1493 Prevent recursion in invalidation processing\n* #1498 Fix overflow in gapfill's interpolate\n* #1499 Fix error for exported_uuid in pg_restore\n* #1503 Fix bug with histogram function in parallel\n\n**Thanks**\n* @dhyun-obsec for reporting an issue with pg_restore\n* @rhaymo for reporting an issue with interpolate\n* @optijon for reporting an issue with locf treat_null_as_missing\n* @fvannee for reporting an issue with runtime exclusion\n* @Lectem for reporting an issue with histograms\n* @rogerdwan for reporting an issue with BGW rescheduling\n* @od0 for reporting an issue with alter_job_schedule\n\n## 1.4.2 (2019-09-11)\n\nThis maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.4.1 release. We deem it medium\npriority for upgrading.\n\nIn particular the fixes contained in this maintenance release address 2 potential\nsegfaults and no other security vulnerabilities. The bugfixes are related to\nbackground workers, OUTER JOINs, ordered append on space partitioned hypertables\nand expression indexes.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1327 Fix chunk exclusion with ordered append\n* #1390 Fix deletes of background workers while a job is running\n* #1392 Fix cagg_agg_validate expression handling (segfault)\n* #1408 Fix ChunkAppend space partitioning support for ordered append\n* #1420 Fix OUTER JOIN qual propagation\n* #1422 Fix background worker error handling (segfault)\n* #1424 Fix ChunkAppend LIMIT pushdown\n* #1429 Fix expression index creation\n\n**Thanks**\n* @shahidhk for reporting an issue with OUTER JOINs\n* @cossbow and @xxGL1TCHxx for reporting reporting issues with ChunkAppend and space partitioning\n* @est for reporting an issue with CASE expressions in continuous aggregates\n* @devlucasc for reporting the issue with deleting a background worker while a job is running\n* @ryan-shaw for reporting an issue with expression indexes on hypertables with dropped columns\n\n## 1.4.1 (2019-08-01)\n\nThis maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.4.0 release. We deem it medium\npriority for upgrading.\n\nIn particular the fixes contained in this maintenance release address 2 potential\nsegfaults and no other security vulnerabilities. The bugfixes are related to queries\nwith prepared statements, PL/pgSQL functions and interoperability with other extensions.\nMore details below.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1362 Fix ConstraintAwareAppend subquery exclusion\n* #1363 Mark drop_chunks as VOLATILE and not PARALLEL SAFE\n* #1369 Fix ChunkAppend with prepared statements\n* #1373 Only allow PARAM_EXTERN as time_bucket_gapfill arguments\n* #1380 Handle Result nodes gracefully in ChunkAppend\n\n**Thanks**\n* @overhacked for reporting an issue with drop_chunks and parallel queries\n* @fvannee for reporting an issue with ConstraintAwareAppend and subqueries\n* @rrb3942 for reporting a segfault with ChunkAppend and prepared statements\n* @mchesser for reporting a segfault with time_bucket_gapfill and subqueries\n* @lolizeppelin for reporting and helping debug an issue with ChunkAppend and Result nodes\n\n## 1.4.0 (2019-07-18)\n\nThis release contains major new functionality for continuous aggregates\nand adds performance improvements for analytical queries.\n\nIn version 1.3.0 we added support for continuous aggregates which\nwas initially limited to one continuous aggregate per hypertable.\nWith this release, we remove this restriction and allow multiple\ncontinuous aggregates per hypertable.\n\nThis release adds a new custom node ChunkAppend that can perform\nexecution time constraint exclusion and is also used for ordered\nappend. Ordered append no longer requires a LIMIT clause and now\nsupports space partitioning and ordering by time_bucket.\n\n**Major features**\n* #1270 Use ChunkAppend to replace Append nodes\n* #1257 Support for multiple continuous aggregates\n\n**Minor features**\n* #1181 Remove LIMIT clause restriction from ordered append\n* #1273 Propagate quals to joined hypertables\n* #1317 Support time bucket functions in Ordered Append\n* #1331 Add warning message for REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW\n* #1332 Add job statistics columns to timescaledb_information.continuous_aggregate_stats view\n* #1326 Add architecture and bit size to telemetry\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1288 Do not remove Result nodes with one-time filter\n* #1300 Fix telemetry report return value\n* #1339 Fix continuous agg catalog table insert failure\n* #1344 Update continuous agg bgw job start time\n\n**Thanks**\n* @ik9999 for reporting a bug with continuous aggregates and negative refresh lag\n\n## 1.3.2 (2019-06-24)\n\nThis maintenance release contains bug and security fixes since the 1.3.1 release. We deem it moderate-to-high priority for upgrading.\n\nThis release fixes some security vulnerabilities, specifically related to being able to elevate role-based permissions by database users that already have access to the database.  We strongly recommend that users who rely on role-based permissions upgrade to this release as soon as possible.\n\n**Security Fixes**\n* #1311 Fix role-based permission checking logic\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1315 Fix potentially lost invalidations in continuous aggs\n* #1303 Fix handling of types with custom time partitioning\n* #1299 Arm32: Fix Datum to int cast issue\n* #1297 Arm32: Fix crashes due to long handling\n* #1019 Add ARM32 tests on travis\n\n**Thanks**\n* @hedayat for reporting the error with handling of types with custom time partitioning\n\n## 1.3.1 (2019-06-10)\n\nThis maintenance release contains bugfixes since the 1.3.0 release.\nWe deem it low-to-moderate priority for upgrading.\n\nIn particular, the fixes contained in this maintenance release do not address any\nsecurity vulnerabilities, while the only one affecting system stability is related\nto TimescaleDB running on PostgreSQL 11.  More details below.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1220 Fix detecting JOINs for continuous aggs\n* #1221 Fix segfault in VACUUM on PG11\n* #1228 ARM32 Fix: Pass int64 using Int64GetDatum when a Datum is required\n* #1232 Allow Param as time_bucket_gapfill arguments\n* #1236 Stop preventing REFRESH in transaction blocks\n* #1283 Fix constraint exclusion for OUTER JOIN\n\n**Thanks**\n* @od0 for reporting an error with continuous aggs and JOINs\n* @rickbatka for reporting an error when using time_bucket_gapfill in functions\n* @OneMoreSec for reporting the bug with VACUUM\n* @dvdrozdov @od0 @t0k4rt for reporting the issue with REFRESH in transaction blocks\n* @mhagander and @devrimgunduz for suggesting adding a CMAKE flag to control the default telemetry level\n\n## 1.3.0 (2019-05-06)\n\nThis release contains major new functionality that we call continuous aggregates.\n\nAggregate queries which touch large swathes of time-series data can take a long\ntime to compute because the system needs to scan large amounts of data on every\nquery execution. Our continuous aggregates continuously calculate the\nresults of a query in the background and materialize the results. Queries to the\ncontinuous aggregate view are then significantly faster as they do not need to\ntouch the raw data in the hypertable, instead using the pre-computed aggregates\nin the view.\n\nContinuous aggregates are somewhat similar to PostgreSQL materialized\nviews, but unlike a materialized view, continuous\naggregates do not need to be refreshed manually; the view will be refreshed\nautomatically in the background as new data is added, or old data is\nmodified. Additionally, it does not need to re-calculate all of the data on\nevery refresh. Only new and/or invalidated data will be calculated.  Since this\nre-aggregation is automatic, it doesn’t add any maintenance burden to your\ndatabase.\n\nOur continuous aggregate approach supports high-ingest rates by avoiding the\nhigh-write amplification associated with trigger-based approaches. Instead,\nwe use invalidation techniques to track what data has changed, and then correct\nthe materialized aggregate the next time that the automated process executes.\n\nMore information can be found on [our docs overview](http://docs.timescale.com/using-timescaledb/continuous-aggregates)\nor in this [tutorial](http://docs.timescale.com/tutorials/continuous-aggs-tutorial).\n\n**Major Features**\n* #1184 Add continuous aggregate functionality\n\n**Minor Features**\n* #1005 Enable creating indexes with one transaction per chunk\n* #1007 Remove hypertable parent from query plans\n* #1038 Infer time_bucket_gapfill arguments from WHERE clause\n* #1062 Make constraint aware append parallel safe\n* #1067 Add treat_null_as_missing option to locf\n* #1112 Add support for window functions to gapfill\n* #1130 Add support for cross datatype chunk exclusion for time types\n* #1134 Add support for partitionwise aggregation\n* #1153 Add time_bucket support to chunk exclusion\n* #1170 Add functions for turning restoring on/off and setting license key\n* #1177 Add transformed time_bucket comparison to quals\n* #1182 Enable optimizing SELECTs within INSERTs\n* #1201 Add telemetry for policies: drop_chunk & reorder\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1010 Add session locks to CLUSTER\n* #1115 Fix ordered append optimization for join queries\n* #1123 Fix gapfill with prepared statements\n* #1125 Fix column handling for columns derived from GROUP BY columns\n* #1132 Adjust ordered append path cost\n* #1155 Limit initial max_open_chunks_per_insert to PG_INT16_MAX\n* #1167 Fix postgres.conf ApacheOnly license\n* #1183 Handle NULL in a check constraint name\n* #1195 Fix cascade in scheduled drop chunks\n* #1196 Fix UPSERT with prepared statements\n\n**Thanks**\n* @spickman for reporting a segfault with ordered append and JOINs\n* @comicfans for reporting a performance regression with ordered append\n* @Specter-Y for reporting a segfault with UPSERT and prepared statements\n* @erthalion submitting a bugfix for a segfault with validating check constraints\n\n## 1.2.2 (2019-03-14)\n\nThis release contains bugfixes.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n* #1097 Adjust ordered append plan cost\n* #1079 Stop background worker on ALTER DATABASE SET TABLESPACE and CREATE DATABASE WITH TEMPLATE\n* #1088 Fix ON CONFLICT when using prepared statements and functions\n* #1089 Fix compatibility with extensions that define planner_hook\n* #1057 Fix chunk exclusion constraint type inference\n* #1060 Fix sort_transform optimization\n\n**Thanks**\n* @esatterwhite for reporting a bug when using timescaledb with zombodb\n* @eeeebbbbrrrr for fixing compatibility with extensions that also define planner_hook\n* @naquad for reporting a segfault when using ON conflict in stored procedures\n* @aaronkaplan for reporting an issue with ALTER DATABASE SET TABLESPACE\n* @quetz for reporting an issue with CREATE DATABASE WITH TEMPLATE\n* @nbouscal for reporting an issue with ordered append resulting in bad plans\n\n## 1.2.1 (2019-02-11)\n\nThis release contains bugfixes.\n\n**Notable commits**\n* [2f6b58a] Fix tlist on hypertable inserts inside CTEs\n* [7973b4a] Stop background worker on rename database\n* [32cc645] Fix loading the tsl license in parallel workers\n\n**Thanks**\n\n* @jamessewell for reporting and helping debug a segfault in last() [034a0b0]\n* @piscopoc for reporting a segfault in time_bucket_gapfill [e6c68f8]\n\n## 1.2.0 (2019-01-29)\n\n**This is our first release to include Timescale-Licensed features, in addition to new Apache-2 capabilities.**\n\nWe are excited to be introducing new time-series analytical functions, advanced data lifecycle management capabilities, and improved performance.\n- **Time-series analytical functions**: Users can now use our `time_bucket_gapfill` function, to write complex gapfilling, last object carried forward, and interpolation queries.\n- **Advanced data lifecycle management**: We are introducing scheduled policies, which use our background worker framework to manage time-series data. In this release, we support scheduled `drop_chunks` and `reorder`.\n- **Improved performance**: We added support for ordered appends, which optimize a large range of queries - particularly those that are ordered by time and contain a LIMIT clause. Please note that ordered appends do not support ordering by `time_bucket` at this time.\n- **Postgres 11 Support**: We added beta support for PG11 in 1.1.0. We're happy to announce that our PG11 support is now out of beta, and fully supported.\n\nThis release adds code under a new license, LICENSE_TIMESCALE. This code can be found in `tsl`.\n\n**For this release only**, you will need to restart the database before running\n`ALTER EXTENSION`\n\n**Notable commits**\n\n* [a531733] switch cis state when we switch chunks\n* [5c6b619] Make a copy of the ri_onConflict object in PG11\n* [61e524e] Make slot for upserts be update for every chunk switch\n* [8a7c127] Fix for ExecSlotDescriptor during upserts\n* [fa61613] Change time_bucket_gapfill argument names\n* [01be394] Fix bgw_launcher restart when failing during launcher setup\n* [7b3929e] Add ordered append optimization\n* [a69f84c] Fix signal processing in background workers\n* [47b5b7d] Log which chunks are dropped by background workers\n* [4e1e15f] Add reorder command\n* [2e4bb5d] Recluster and drop chunks scheduling code\n* [ef43e52] Add alter_policy_schedule API function\n* [5ba740e] Add gapfill query support\n* [be7c74c] Add logic for automatic DB maintenance functions\n* [4ff6ac7] Initial Timescale-Licensed-Module and License-Key Implementation\n* [fc42539] Add new top-level licensing information\n* [31e9c5b] Fix time column handling in get_create_command\n* [1b8ceca] Avoid loading twice in parallel workers and load only from $libdir\n* [76d7875] Don't throw errors when extension is loaded but not installed yet\n* [eecd845] Add Timescale License (TSL)\n* [4b42b30] Free ChunkInsertStates when the es_per_tuple_exprcontext is freed\n\n**Thanks**\n\n* @fordred for reporting our docker-run.sh script was out of date\n* @JpWebster for reporting a deadlock between reads an drop_chunks\n* @chickenburgers for reporting an issue with our CMake\n* Dimtrj and Asbjørn D., on slack, for creating a reproducible testcase for an UPSERT bug\n* @skebanga for reporting a loader bug\n\n\n## 1.1.1 (2018-12-20)\n\nThis release contains bugfixes.\n\n**High-level changes**\n* Fix issue when upgrading with pg_upgrade\n* Fix a segfault that sometimes appeared in long COPYs\n* Other bug and stability fixes\n\n**Notable commits**\n\n* [f99b540] Avoid loading twice in parallel workers and load only from $libdir\n* [e310f7d] Don't throw errors when extension is loaded but not installed yet\n* [8498416] Free ChunkInsertStates when the es_per_tuple_exprcontext is freed\n* [937eefe] Set C standard to C11\n\n**Thanks**\n\n* @costigator for reporting the pg_upgrade bug\n* @FireAndIce68 for reporting the parallel workers issue\n* @damirda for reporting the copy bug\n\n## 1.1.0 (2018-12-13)\n\nOur 1.1 release introduces beta support for PG 11, as well as several performance optimizations aimed at improving chunk exclusion for read queries. We are also packaging our new timescale-tune tool (currently in beta) with our Debian and Linux releases. If you encounter any issues with our beta features, please file a Github issue.\n\n**Potential breaking changes**\n- In addition to optimizing first() / last() to utilize indices for non-group-by queries, we adjusted its sorting behavior to match that of PostgreSQL’s max() and min() functions. Previously, if the column being sorted had NULL values, a NULL would be returned. First() and last() now instead ignore NULL values.\n\n**Notable Commits**\n\n* [71f3a0c] Fix Datum conversion issues\n* [5aa1eda] Refactor compatibility functions and code to support PG11\n* [e4a4f8e] Add support for functions on open (time) dimensions\n* [ed5067c] Fix interval_from_now_to_internal timestamptz handling\n* [019971c] Optimize FIRST/LAST aggregate functions\n* [83014ee] Implement drop_chunks in C\n* [9a34028] Implement show_chunks in C and have drop_chunks use it\n* [d461959] Add view to show hypertable information\n* [35dee48] Remove version-checking from client-side\n* [5b6a5f4] Change size utility and job functions to STRICT\n* [7e55d91] Add checks for NULL arguments to DDL functions\n* [c1db608] Fix upsert TLE translation when mapping variable numbers\n* [55a378e] Check extension exists for DROP OWNED and DROP EXTENSION\n* [0c8c085] Exclude unneeded chunks for IN/ANY/ALL operators\n* [f27c0a3] Move int time_bucket functions with offset to C\n\n**Thanks**\n* @did-g for some memory improvements\n\n## 1.0.1 (2018-12-05)\n\nThis commit contains bugfixes and optimizations for 1.0.0\n\n**Notable commits**\n\n* [6553aa4] Make a number of size utility functions to `STRICT`\n* [bb1d748] Add checks for NULL arguments to `set_adaptive_chunking`, `set_number_partitions`, `set_chunk_time_interval`, `add_dimension`, and `create_hypertable`\n* [a534ed4] Fix upsert TLE translation when mapping variable numbers\n* [aecd55b] Check extension exists for DROP OWNED and DROP EXTENSION\n\n## 1.0.0 (2018-10-30)\n\n**This is our 1.0 release!**\n\nFor notable commits between 0.12.0/0.12.1 and this final 1.0 release, please see previous entries for the release candidates (rc1, rc2, and rc3).\n\n**Thanks**\nTo all the external contributors who helped us debug the release candidates, as well as anyone who has contributed bug reports, PRs, or feedback on Slack, GitHub, and other channels. All input has been valuable and helped us create the product we have today!\n\n**Potential breaking changes**\n* To better align with the ISO standard so that time bucketing starts each week by default on a Monday (rather than Saturday), the `time_bucket` epoch/origin has been changed from January 1, 2000 to January 3, 2000.  The function now includes an `origin` parameter that can be used to adjust this.\n* Error codes are now prefixed with `TS` instead of the prior `IO` prefix.

We expect to only merge bug fixes between now and our final 1.0 release. This is a big milestone for us and signifies our maturity and enterprise readiness.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** that release candidate (rc) builds will only be made available via GitHub and Docker, and _not_ on other release channels. Please help us test these release candidates out if you can!\n\n**Potential breaking change**: Starting with rc2, we updated our error codes to be prefixed with `TS` instead of the old `IO` prefix.

Each database running within a PostgreSQL instance has a scheduler that schedules recurring jobs from a new jobs table while maintaining statistics that inform the scheduler's policy. Future releases will leverage this scheduler framework for more automated management of data retention, archiving, analytics, and the like.\n\n*Telemetry:* Using this new scheduler framework, TimescaleDB databases now send anonymized usage information to a telemetry server via HTTPS, as well as perform version checking to notify users if a newer version is available. For transparency, a new `get_telemetry_report` function details the exact JSON that is sent, and users may also opt out of this telemetry and version check.\n\n*Continued hardening:* This release addresses several issues around more robust backup and recovery, handling large numbers of chunks, and additional test coverage.\n\n**Notable commits**\n\n* [efab2aa] Fix net lib functionality on Windows and improve error handling\n* [71589c4] Fix issues when OpenSSL is not available\n* [a43cd04] Call the main telemetry function inside BGW executor\n* [faf481b] Add telemetry functionality\n* [45a2b76] Add new Connection and HTTP libraries\n* [b6fe657] Fix max_background_workers guc, errors on EXEC_BACKEND and formatting\n* [5d8c7cc] Add a scheduler for background jobs\n* [55a7141] Implement a cluster-wide launcher for background workers\n* [5bc705f] Update bootstrap to check for cmake and exit if not found\n* [98e56dd] Improve show_indexes test func to be more platform agnostic\n* [b928caa] Note how to recreate templated files\n* [8571e41] Use AttrNumberGetAttrOffset instead of Anum_name - 1 for array indexing\n* [d1710ef] Improve regression test script to cleanup more thoroughly\n* [fc3677f] Reduce number of open chunks per insert\n* [027b7b2] Hide extension symbols by default on Unix platforms\n* [6a3abe5] Fix SubspaceStore to ensure max_open_chunks_per_insert is obeyed\n\n**Thanks**\n\n@EvanCarroll for updates to the bootstrap script to check for cmake\n\n\n## 0.11.0 (2018-08-08)\n\n**High-level changes**\n\n* **Adaptive chunking**: This feature, currently in beta, allows the database to automatically adapt a chunk's time interval, so that users do not need to manually set (and possibly manually change) this interval size. In this release, users can specify either a target chunk data size (in terms of MB or GB), and the chunk's time intervals will be automatically adapted. Alternatively, users can ask the database to just estimate a target size itself based on the platform's available memory and other parameters, and the system will adapt accordingly. This type of automation can simplify initial database test and operations. This feature is default off. Note: The default time interval for non-adaptive chunking has also been changed from 1 month to 1 week.\n* **Continued hardening**: This release addresses a number of less frequently used schema modifications, functions, or constraints. Unsupported functions are safely blocked, while we have added support for a number of new types of table alterations. This release also adds additional test coverage.\n* Support for additional types of time columns, if they are binary compatible (thanks @fvannee!).\n\n**Notable commits**\n\n* [9ba2e81] Fix segfault with custom partition types\n* [7e9bf25] Change default chunk size to one week\n* [506fa18] Add tests for custom types\n* [1d9ade7] add support for other types as timescale column\n* [570f2f8] Validate parameters when creating partition info\n* [148f2da] Use shared_buffers as the available cache memory\n* [e0a15c1] Add additional comments to explain algorithm\n* [d81dccb] Set the default chunk_time_interval to 1 day with adaptive chunking enabled\n* [2e7b32c] Add WARNING when doing min-max heap scan for adaptive chunking\n* [6b452a8] Update adaptive chunk algorithm to handle very small chunks.\n* [9c9cdca] Add support for adaptive chunk sizing\n* [7f8d17d] Handle DEFERRED and VALID options for constraints\n* [0c5c21b] Block using rules with hypertables\n* [37142e9] Block INSERTs on a hypertable's root table\n* [4daf087] Fix some ALTER TABLE corner case bugs on hypertables\n* [122f5f1] Block replica identity usage with hypertables\n* [8bf552e] Block unlogged tables from being used as hypertables\n* [a8c637e] Create aggregate functions only once to avoid dependency issues\n* [a97f2af] Add support for custom hypertable dimension types\n* [dfe026c] Refactor create_hypertable rel access.\n* [ed379c3] Validate existing indexes before adding a new dimension\n* [1f2d276] Fix and improve show_indexes test support function\n* [77b0035] Enforce IMMUTABLE partitioning functions\n* [cbc5e60] Block NO INHERIT constraints on hypertables\n* [e362e9c] Block mixing hypertables with postgres inheritance\n* [011f12b] Add support for CLUSTER ON and SET WITHOUT CLUSTER\n* [e947c6b] Improve handling of column settings\n* [fc4957b] Update statistics on parent table when doing ANALYZE\n* [82942bf] Enable backwards compatibility for loader for 0.9.0 and 0.9.1\n\n**Thanks**\n\n* @Ngalstyan4 and @hjsuh18, our interns, for all of the PRs this summer\n* @fvannee for a PR adding support for binary compatible custom types as a time column\n* @fmacelw for reporting a bug where first() and last() hold reference across extension update\n* @soccerdroid for reporting a corner case bug in ALTER TABLE\n\n\n## 0.10.1 (2018-07-12)\n\n**High-level changes**\n* Improved memory management for long-lived connections.\n* Fixed handling of dropping triggers that would lead to orphaned references in pg_depend.\n* Fixed pruning in CustomScan when the subplan is not a Scan type that caused a crash with LATERALs.\n* Corrected size reporting that was not accurately counting TOAST size\n* Updated error messages that more closely conform to PG style.\n* Corrected handling of table and schema name changes to chunks;

Make VACUUM and REINDEX recurse to chunks\n* [55bfdf7] Release all cache pins when a transaction ends\n\n## 0.3.0 (2017-07-31)\n\n**High-level changes**\n* \"Upserts\" are now supported via normal `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`/`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` syntax. However, `ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT` is not yet supported.\n* Improved support for user-defined triggers on hypertables. Now handles both INSERT BEFORE and INSERT AFTER triggers, and triggers can be named arbitrarily (before, a \\_0\\_ prefix was required to ensure correct execution priority).\n* `TRUNCATE` on a hypertable now deletes empty chunks.\n\n**Notable commits**\n* [23f9d3c] Add support for upserts (`ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`)\n* [1f3dcd8] Make `INSERT`s use a custom plan instead of triggers\n* [f23bf58] Remove empty chunks on `TRUNCATE` hypertable.\n\n## 0.2.0 (2017-07-12)\n\n**High-level changes**\n* Users can now define their own triggers on hypertables (except for `INSERT AFTER`)\n* Hypertables can now be renamed or moved to a different schema\n* Utility functions added so you can examine the size hypertables, chunks, and indices\n\n**Notable commits**\n* [83c75fd] Add support for triggers on hypertables for all triggers except `INSERT AFTER`\n* [e0eeeb9] Add hypertable, chunk, and indexes size utils functions.\n* [4d2a65d] Add infrastructure to build update script files.\n* [a5725d9] Add support to rename and change schema on hypertable.\n* [142f58c] Cleanup planner and process utility hooks\n\n## 0.1.0 (2017-06-28)\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**\n\nStarting with this release, TimescaleDB will now\nsupport upgrading between extension versions using the typical\n`ALTER EXTENSION` command, unless otherwise noted in future release notes. This\nimportant step should make it easier to test TimescaleDB and be able\nto get the latest benefits from new versions of TimescaleDB. If you\nwere previously using a version with the `-beta` tag, you will need\nto `DROP` any databases currently using TimescaleDB and re-create them\nin order to upgrade to this new version. To backup and migrate data,\nuse `pg_dump` to save the table schemas and `COPY` to write hypertable\ndata to CSV for re-importing after upgrading is complete. We describe\na similar process on [our docs](http://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/setup/migrate-from-postgresql#different-db).\n\n**High-level changes**\n* More refactoring to stabilize and cleanup the code base for supporting upgrades (see above note)\n* Correct handling of ownership and permission propagation for hypertables\n* Multiple bug fixes\n\n**Notable commits**\n* [696cc4c] Provide API for adding hypertable dimensions\n* [97681c2] Fixes permission handling\n* [aca7f32] Fix extension drop handling\n* [9b8a447] Limit the SubspaceStore size; Add documentation.\n* [14ac892] Fix possible segfault\n* [0f4169c] Fix check constraint on dimension table\n* [71c5e78] Fix and refactor tablespace support\n* [5452dc5] Fix partiton functions; bug fixes (including memory)\n* [e75cd7e] Finer grained memory management\n* [3c460f0] Fix partitioning, memory, and tests\n* [fe51d8d] Add native scan for the chunk table\n* [fc68baa] Separate out subspace_store and add it to the hypertable object as well\n* [c8124b8] Use hypercube instead of dimension slice list\n* [f5d7786] Change the semantics of range_end to be exclusive\n* [700c9c8] Refactor insert path in C.\n* [0584c47] Created chunk_get_or_create in sql with an SPI connector in C\n* [7b8de0c] Refactor catalog for new schema and add native data types\n* [d3bdcba] Start refactoring to support any number of partitioning dimensions\n\n## 0.0.12-beta (2017-06-21)\n\n**High-level changes**\n* A major cleanup and refactoring was done to remove legacy code and\ncurrently unused code paths. This change is **backwards incompatible**\nand will require a database to be re-initialized and data re-imported.\nThis refactoring will allow us to provide upgrade paths starting with\nthe next release.\n* `COPY` and `INSERT` commands now return the correct number of rows\n* Default indexes no longer duplicate existing indexes\n* Cleanup of the Docker image and build process\n* Chunks are now time-aligned across partitions\n\n**Notable commits**\n* [3192c8a] Remove Dockerfile and docker.mk\n* [2a01ebc] Ensure that chunks are aligned.\n* [73622bf] Fix default index creation duplication of indexes\n* [c8872fe] Fix command-tag for COPY and INSERT\n* [bfe58b6] Refactor towards supporting version upgrades\n* [db01c84] Make time-bucket function parallel safe\n* [18db11c] Fix timestamp test\n* [97bbb59] Make constraint exclusion work with non-text partition keys\n* [f2b42eb] Fix problems with partitioning logic for padded fields\n* [997029a] if_not_exist flag to create_hypertable now works on hypertables with data as well\n* [347a8bd] Reference the correct column when scanning partition epochs\n* [88a9849] Fix bug with timescaledb.allow_install_without_preload GUC not working\n\n## 0.0.11-beta (2017-05-24)\n\n**High-level changes**\n* New `first(value, time)` and `last(value, time)` aggregates\n* Remove `setup_timescaledb()` function to streamline setup\n* Allow for use cases where restarting the server is not feasible by force loading the library\n* Disable time series optimizations on non-hypertables\n* Add some default indexes for hypertables if they do not exist\n* Add \"if not exists\" flag for `create_hypertable`\n* Several bug fixes and cleanups\n\n**Notable commits**\n* [8ccc8cc] Add if_not_exists flag to create_hypertable()\n* [2bc60c7] Fix time interval field name in hypertable cache entry\n* [4638688] Improve GUC handling\n* [cedcafc] Remove setup_timescaledb() and fix pg_dump/pg_restore.\n* [34ad9a0] Add error when timescaledb library is not preloaded.\n* [fc4ddd6] Fix bug with dropping chunks on tables with indexes\n* [32215ff] Add default indexes for hypertables\n* [b2900f9] Disable query optimization on regular tables (non-hypertables)\n* [f227db4] Fixes command tag return for COPY on hypertables.\n* [eb32081] Fix Invalid database ID error\n* [662be94] Add the first(value, time),last(value, time) aggregates\n* [384a8fb] Add regression tests for deleted unit tests\n* [31ee92a] Remove unit tests and sql/setup\n* [13d3acb] Fix bug with alter table add/drop column if exists\n* [f960c24] Fix bug with querying a row as a composite type\n\n## 0.0.10-beta (2017-05-04)\n\n**High-level changes**\n* New `time_bucket` functions for doing roll-ups on varied intervals\n* Change default partition function (thanks @robin900)\n* Variety of bug fixes\n\n**Notable commits**\n* [1c4868d] Add documentation for chunk_time_interval argument\n* [55fd2f2] Fixes command tag return for `INSERT`s on hypertables.\n* [c3f930f] Add `time_bucket` functions\n* [b128ac2] Fix bug with `INSERT INTO...SELECT`\n* [e20edf8] Add better error checking for index creation.\n* [72f754a] use PostgreSQL's own `hash_any` function as default partfunc (thanks @robin900)\n* [39f4c0f] Remove sample data instructions and point to docs site\n* [9015314] Revised the `get_general_index_definition` function to handle cases where indexes have definitions other than just `CREATE INDEX` (thanks @bricklen)\n"

This is the best place to\ndiscuss your proposed improvement (and its implementation) with the core\ndevelopment team.\n\nBefore we accept any code contributions, Timescale contributors need to\nsign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/timescale/timescaledb) (CLA). By signing a CLA, we can\nensure that the community is free and confident in its ability to use your\ncontributions.\n\n## Getting and building TimescaleDB\n\nPlease follow our README for [instructions on installing from source](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/blob/main/README.md#option-3---from-source).\n\n## Style guide\n\nBefore submitting any contributions, please ensure that it adheres to\nour [Style Guide](docs/StyleGuide.md).\n\n## Code review workflow\n\n* Sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/timescale/timescaledb) (CLA) if you're a new contributor.\n\n* Develop on your local branch:\n\n    * Fork the repository and create a local feature branch to do work on,\n      ideally on one thing at a time.  Don't mix bug fixes with unrelated\n      feature enhancements or stylistical changes.\n\n    * Hack away. Add tests for non-trivial changes.\n\n    * Run the [test suite](#testing) and make sure everything passes.\n\n    * When committing, be sure to write good commit messages according to [these\n      seven rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules). Doing \n      `git commit` prints a message if any of the rules is violated. \n      Stylistically,\n      we use commit message titles in the imperative tense, e.g., `Add\n      merge-append query optimization for time aggregate`.  In the case of\n      non-trivial changes, include a longer description in the commit message\n      body explaining and detailing the changes.  That is, a commit message\n      should have a short title, followed by a empty line, and then\n      followed by the longer description.\n\n    * When committing, link which GitHub issue of [this \n      repository](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/issues) is fixed or \n      closed by the commit with a [linking keyword recognised by \n      GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword). \n      For example, if the commit fixes bug 123, add a line at the end of the \n      commit message with  `Fixes #123`, if the commit implements feature \n      request 321, add a line at the end of the commit message `Closes #321`.\n      This will be recognized by GitHub. It will close the corresponding issue \n      and place a hyperlink under the number.\n\n* Push your changes to an upstream branch:\n\n    * Make sure that each commit in the pull request will represent a\n      logical change to the code, will compile, and will pass tests.\n\n    * Make sure that the pull request message contains all important \n      information from the commit messages including which issues are\n      fixed and closed. If a pull request contains one commit only, then\n      repeating the commit message is preferred, which is done automatically\n      by GitHub when it creates the pull request.\n\n    * Rebase your local feature branch against main (`git fetch origin`,\n      then `git rebase origin/main`) to make sure you're\n      submitting your changes on top of the newest version of our code.\n\n    * When finalizing your PR (i.e., it has been approved for merging),\n      aim for the fewest number of commits that\n      make sense. That is, squash any \"fix up\" commits into the commit they\n      fix rather than keep them separate. Each commit should represent a\n      clean, logical change and include a descriptive commit message.\n\n    * Push your commit to your upstream feature branch: `git push -u <yourfork> my-feature-branch`\n\n* Create and manage pull request:\n\n    * [Create a pull request using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).\n      If you know a core developer well suited to reviewing your pull\n      request, either mention them (preferably by GitHub name) in the PR's\n      body or [assign them as a reviewer](https://help.github.com/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users/).\n\n    * If you get a test failure in the CI, check them under [Github Actions](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/actions)\n\n    * Address feedback by amending your commit(s). If your change contains\n      multiple commits, address each piece of feedback by amending that\n      commit to which the particular feedback is aimed.\n\n    * The PR is marked as accepted when the reviewer thinks it's ready to be\n      merged.  Most new contributors aren't allowed to merge themselves; in\n      that case, we'll do it for you.\n\n## Testing\n\nEvery non-trivial change to the code base should be accompanied by a\nrelevant addition to or modification of the test suite.\n\nPlease check that the full test suite (including your test additions\nor changes) passes successfully on your local machine **before you\nopen a pull request**.\n\nIf you are running locally:\n```bash\n# Use Debug build mode for full battery of tests\n./bootstrap -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\ncd build && make\nmake installcheck\n```\n\nAll submitted pull requests are also automatically\nrun against our test suite via [Github Actions](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/actions)\n(that link shows the latest build status of the repository).\n\n"

Run the TimescaleDB container:\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg17\n    ```\n\n1. Connect to a database:\n\n    ```bash\n    docker exec -it timescaledb psql -d \"postgres://postgres:password@localhost/postgres\"\n    ```\n\nSee [other installation options](https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/install/) or try [Timescale Cloud](https://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/latest/) for free.\n\n## Create a hypertable\n\nYou create a regular table and then convert it into a hypertable. A hypertable automatically partitions data into chunks based on your configuration.\n\n```sql\n-- Create timescaledb extension\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;\n\n-- Create a regular SQL table\nCREATE TABLE conditions (\n  time        TIMESTAMPTZ       NOT NULL,\n  location    TEXT              NOT NULL,\n  temperature DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL,\n  humidity    DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL\n);\n\n-- Convert the table into a hypertable that is partitioned by time\nSELECT create_hypertable('conditions', by_range('time'));\n```\n\nSee more:\n\n- [About hypertables](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/hypertables/)\n- [API reference](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hypertable/)\n\n## Enable columnstore\n\nTimescaleDB's hypercore is a hybrid row-columnar store that boosts analytical query performance on your time-series and event data, while reducing data size by more than 90%. This keeps your queries operating at lightning speed and ensures low storage costs as you scale. Data is inserted in row format in the rowstore and converted to columnar format in the columnstore based on your configuration.\n\n- Configure the columnstore on a hypertable:\n\n    ```sql\n    ALTER TABLE conditions SET (\n      timescaledb.compress,\n      timescaledb.compress_segmentby = 'location'\n    );\n    ```\n\n- Create a policy to automatically convert chunks in row format that are older than seven days to chunks in the columnar format:\n\n    ```sql\n    SELECT add_compression_policy('conditions', INTERVAL '7 days');\n    ```\n\nSee more:\n\n- [About columnstore](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/compression/about-compression/)\n- [Enable columnstore manually](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/compression/manual-compression/)\n- [API reference](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/compression/)\n\n## Insert and query data\n\nInsert and query data in a hypertable via regular SQL commands. For example:\n\n- Insert data into a hypertable named `conditions`:\n\n    ```sql\n    INSERT INTO conditions\n      VALUES\n        (NOW(), 'office',   70.0, 50.0),\n        (NOW(), 'basement', 66.5, 60.0),\n        (NOW(), 'garage',   77.0, 65.2);\n    ```\n\n- Return the number of entries written to the table conditions in the last 12 hours:\n\n    ```sql\n    SELECT\n      COUNT(*)\n    FROM\n      conditions\n    WHERE\n      time > NOW() - INTERVAL '12 hours';\n    ```\n\nSee more:\n\n- [Query data](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/query-data/)\n- [Write data](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/write-data/)\n\n## Create time buckets\n\nTime buckets enable you to aggregate data in hypertables by time interval and calculate summary values.\n\nFor example, calculate the average daily temperature in a table named `conditions`. The table has a `time` and `temperature` columns:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  time_bucket('1 day', time) AS bucket,\n  AVG(temperature) AS avg_temp\nFROM\n  conditions\nGROUP BY\n  bucket\nORDER BY\n  bucket ASC;\n```\n\nSee more:\n\n- [About time buckets](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/time-buckets/about-time-buckets/)\n- [API reference](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/time_bucket/)\n- [All TimescaleDB features](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/)\n- [Tutorials](https://docs.timescale.com/tutorials/latest/)\n\n## Create continuous aggregates\n\nContinuous aggregates are designed to make queries on very large datasets run faster. They continuously and incrementally refresh a query in the background, so that when you run such query, only the data that has changed needs to be computed, not the entire dataset. This is what makes them different from regular PostgreSQL [materialized views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-materializedviews.html), which cannot be incrementally materialized and have to be rebuilt from scratch every time you want to refresh it.\n\nFor example, create a continuous aggregate view for daily weather data in two simple steps:\n\n1. Create a materialized view:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW conditions_summary_daily\n   WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS\n   SELECT\n     location,\n     time_bucket(INTERVAL '1 day', time) AS bucket,\n     AVG(temperature),\n     MAX(temperature),\n     MIN(temperature)\n   FROM\n     conditions\n   GROUP BY\n     location,\n     bucket;\n   ```\n\n1. Create a policy to refresh the view every hour:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT\n     add_continuous_aggregate_policy(\n       'conditions_summary_daily',\n       start_offset => INTERVAL '1 month',\n       end_offset => INTERVAL '1 day',\n       schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 hour'\n   );\n   ```\nSee more:\n\n- [About continuous aggregates](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/continuous-aggregates/)\n- [API reference](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/continuous-aggregates/create_materialized_view/)\n\n## Want TimescaleDB hosted and managed for you?

Therefore, we ask that people follow the below instructions to report security vulnerability.\nThe entire Timescale community thanks you!\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nThe supported version is always the latest major release available in our repository.\nWe also release regular minor versions with fixes and corrections alongside some new features as well as patchfix releases, that you should keep upgrading to.\nVulnerability fixes are made available as part of these patchfix releases and you can read our list of [Security Advisories](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/security/advisories?state=published).\n \nYou can also take a look at our [Support Policy](https://www.timescale.com/legal/support-policy).\n\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability\n\nIf you find a vulnerability in our software, please email the Timescale Security Team at security@timescale.com.\n\nPlease note that the e-mail address should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Timescale products and services. \nRegular bug reports should be submitted as GitHub issues, while other _questions_ around security,\ncompliance, or functionality can be made either through our support (for customers) or\ncommunity channels (e.g., [Timescale Slack](https://slack.timescale.com/), [Forums](https://www.timescale.com/forums), etc.)\n"
