Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It was written several years ago [as one of my first projects when I was in High School](https://github.com/SamyPesse/devos), I'm still refactoring some parts. The original course was in French and I'm not an English native. I'm going to continue and improve this course in my free-time.\n\n**Book**: An online version is available at [http://samypesse.gitbooks.io/how-to-create-an-operating-system/](http://samypesse.gitbooks.io/how-to-create-an-operating-system/) (PDF, Mobi and ePub). It was generated using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/).\n\n**Source Code**: All the system source code will be stored in the [src](https://github.com/SamyPesse/How-to-Make-a-Computer-Operating-System/tree/master/src) directory. Each step will contain links to the different related files.\n\n**Contributions**: This course is open to contributions, feel free to signal errors with issues or directly correct the errors with pull-requests.\n\n**Questions**: Feel free to ask any questions by adding issues or commenting sections.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter [@SamyPesse](https://twitter.com/SamyPesse) or [GitHub](https://github.com/SamyPesse).\n\n### What kind of OS are we building?\n\nThe goal is to build a very simple UNIX-based operating system in C++, not just a \"proof-of-concept\". The OS should be able to boot, start a userland shell, and be extensible.\n\n![Screen](./preview.png)\n"
