The Free Translation Project is\na way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all\ntogether, so that free software will gradually become able to speak many\nlanguages.  A few packages already provide translations for their\nmessages.\n\n   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may\nassume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,\nitself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_\nneed to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using\nthis package with messages translated.\n\n   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also\nexplain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the\navailable translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and\nwork on translations can contact the appropriate team.\n\n   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be\nrelated to internationalization, you should tell about the version of\n`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the\n`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.\n\n1.1 Quick configuration advice\n==============================\n\nIf you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you\nshould configure it using\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n\nto force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this\npackage, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the\noperating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only\nthe `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as\nmany features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic\ncharset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.\nIt is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top\nof a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will\nvery likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea\nto change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.\n\n   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or\nyou have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the\nincluded `libintl'.\n\n1.2 INSTALL Matters\n===================\n\nSome packages are \"localizable\" when properly installed; the programs\nthey contain can be made to speak your own native language.  Most such\npackages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own ways to\ninternationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.\n\n   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of\nmessages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already\nprovides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the included GNU\n`gettext' library will be used.  This library is wholly contained\nwithin this package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior\ninstallation of the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.\nInstallers may use special options at configuration time for changing\nthe default behaviour.  The commands:\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n     ./configure --disable-nls\n\nwill, respectively, bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the\ninternationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,\n_totally_ disable translation of messages.\n\n   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run\nconfigure without an option for your new package, `configure' will\nprobably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and\nwill decide to use this.  This might not be desirable.  You should use\nthe more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e. if the file\n`intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this package is\nmore recent, you should use\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n\nto prevent auto-detection.\n\n   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function\nand therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an\nemulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the\nextensions of the GNU `gettext' library.\n\n   Internationalized packages usually have many `po/LL.po' files, where\nLL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless\ntranslations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the\n`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed\ntogether with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'\nmay be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.\n`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter\ncodes, stating which languages are allowed.\n\n1.3 Using This Package\n======================\n\nAs a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you\nonly have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate\n`LL_CC' combination.  If you happen to have the `LC_ALL' or some other\n`LC_xxx' environment variables set, you should unset them before\nsetting `LANG', otherwise the setting of `LANG' will not have the\ndesired effect.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code, and\n`CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's\nsuppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell\nprompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),\n`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').\nThis can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for\nall.\n\n   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.\nBut in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For\nexample, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The\ncountry code serves to distinguish the dialects.\n\n   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the\nlanguage and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based\non GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are\nused, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of\nlocales supported by your system for your language by running the\ncommand `locale -a | grep '^LL''.\n\n   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an\nEnglish message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you\nunderstand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.\nThis is done through a different environment variable, called\n`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'\nfor the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'\nset to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the\nsystem libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather\nread translations in German than English for when Swedish is not\navailable, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.\n\n   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian\nbokma*l changed from `no' to `nb' recently (in 2003).  During the\ntransition period, while some message catalogs for this language are\ninstalled under `nb' and some older ones under `no', it's recommended\nfor Norwegian users to set `LANGUAGE' to `nb:no' so that both newer and\nolder translations are used.\n\n   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'\nenvironment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'\nto denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent\nto `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'\n(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.\n\n1.4 Translating Teams\n=====================\n\nFor the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested\npeople who like their own language and write it well, and who are also\nable to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.\nEach translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of\nteams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,\n`http://translationproject.org/', in the \"Teams\" area.\n\n   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you\nshould become a member of the translating team for your own language.\nThe subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has\n`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a\nmessage to `sv-request@li.org', having this message body:\n\n     subscribe\n\n   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate\n_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,\nrather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and\nyou want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to\nget started, please write to `coordinator@translationproject.org' to\nreach the coordinator for all translator teams.\n\n   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing\nthe terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skills are praised more than\nprogramming skills, here.\n\n1.5 Available Packages\n======================\n\nLanguages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following\nmatrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of May 2010.\nThe matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages PO\nfiles have been submitted to translation coordination, with a\ntranslation percentage of at least 50%.\n\n     Ready PO files       af am ar as ast az be be@latin bg bn_IN bs ca crh\n

This is because a few extra PO files are\nused for implementing regional variants of languages, or language\ndialects.\n\n   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to\nwhich it applies should also have been internationalized and\ndistributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable\nlag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a\ndistribution.\n\n   If May 2010 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy of\nthis `ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.  The most up-to-date\nmatrix with full percentage details can be found at\n`http://translationproject.org/extra/matrix.html'.\n\n1.6 Using `gettext' in new packages\n===================================\n\nIf you are writing a freely available program and want to\ninternationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your\npackage.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public\nLicense which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means\nin particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared\nlibrary, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static\nlibrary or use modified versions of `libintl'.\n\n   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle\nthe use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The\nFree Translation Project is also available for packages which are not\ndeveloped inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above\napplies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact\n`coordinator@translationproject.org' to make the `.pot' files available\nto the translation teams.\n\n"

          "content": "# Building Audacity\n\n## NOTE: These instructions are work-in-progress and will be finalized closer to release of Audacity 4.\n\n## Requirements & Dependencies\n\n* Git\n* CMake\n* A package manager (tested: Choco on Windows, homebrew on macOS)\n* A CMake generator (tested: Ninja)\n* A C++ compiler (tested: MSVC on Windows, g++ on Linux)\n* Qt 6.2.4, with modules:\n  * Qt Network Authorization\n  * Qt 5 Compatibility Module\n  * Qt State Machines\n\n## Setup\n\nAs large parts of Audacity 4 are based on MuseScore Studio, the general setup steps from it are applicable here too:\n\n1. [Set up a developer environment](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki/Set-up-developer-environment)\n2. [Install Qt and Qt Creator](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki/Install-Qt-and-Qt-Creator) (with Qt version 6.2.4; not the latest version)\n\n### Get the Audacity source\n\nTo get the source, `git clone https://github.com/audacity/audacity.git` in the folder of your choice. See the [Github help](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories) for more information. \n\n### Get dependencies\n\nIf you haven't installed the dependencies listed above, now is the time to do so. \n\nNinja should be able to handle the other dependencies, if it doesn't, the list may be inferred from the \"setup\" file in buildscripts/ci/{your OS}/. \n\nNB: At the moment, the list is rather long due to MuseScore dependencies that have not yet been cleaned up.\n\n### Add relevant tools to PATH\n\nGit, CMake, Ninja, Package manager, Compiler and Qt should all be added to the PATH variable in your OS. Otherwise, you'll need to specify them in the CMakeCache later on.\n\n## Compiling\n\n### With QtCreator\n\nUsing QtCreator to edit and compile the will provide the best intellisense and debugging support when interacting with QML. Nevertheless, debugging on Windows is slow, and if you mostly interact with the C++ code, you might want to other options, such as those listed below.\n\nTo compile, just open CMakeLists.txt with QtCreator, configure the project with the auto-detected Qt 6.2.4 kit, and hit Build.\n\n### From the command line\n\nStandard cmake building applies: \n\n```\n# inside the audacity source:\ncmake -S . -B build/ [options]  # configure (first build only)\ncmake --build build/            # build (every build)\ncmake --install build/          # install (every successful build)\n```\n\n### With Visual Studio (Windows only)\n\nDouble-click the `generate_sln.bat` script in the root of the repository. This will generate a Visual Studio solution in the `build` directory and build the `install` target. Open the generated solution (./build/audacity.sln) in Visual Studio and press F5 to run Audacity.\n\n### With VSCode (Windows only)\n\nTODO: generalize to other OSes\n\nNote: the default generator is Ninja. Have it installed, or change the \"cmake.generator\" value in `.vscode/settings.json` to something else (eg `Visual Studio 16 2019`).\n\n#### Open the workspace\nOne way of doing this is by executing Ctrl+Shift+P, and choosing \"Open Workspace from File\". Navigate to the root of the repository and select the `.vscode/audacity.code-workspace` file. Else, you can open the folder, then the workspace file, and click the \"Open Workspace\" button.\n\n#### Install recommended extensions\nWhen opening the repository in VSCode, you will be prompted to install recommended extensions. You can do it then. If you missed it, you can install them later by executing Ctrl+Shift+P, typing `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions`, and installing the recommended extensions.\n\nYou should only have to do this once.\n\n##### Configure and build install target\n\nExecute Ctrl+Shift+P and choose \"CMake: Configure\".\n\n#### Build and run audacity\n\nJust **press F5**. It will build and install everything the first time, but afterwards it should be very fast, especially if you're using Ninja `:)`.\n\n"

This allows you to work from any device, share & collaborate with others and restore previous versions if something went wrong.\n   * Automatic tempo detection\n     Audacity can now automatically detect the tempo of imported loops, and adjust them to be in tempo. \n     Tempo detection is done via both audio analysis and metadata checking. If you want to prepare your loop for automatic tempo detection without relying on audio analysis, both acidizer tempo tags or simply writing \"123 bpm\" anywhere into the filename work.\n     Automatic tempo detection can be turned off via Preferences -> Import/Export.\n   * Pitch shifting \n     You now can non-destructively change the pitch of a clip by holding Alt and pressing the Up and Down arrow keys. Alternatively, you can click on the overflow menu (...) and select \"Pitch and speed...\". When changing the pitch this way, an arrow in the UI indicates how much you've shifted it. \n\n Other changes\n\n  Additions\n   * Added an option to skip plugin scanning to Preferences -> Effects.\n   * Added an overflow menu, as well as speed and pitch indicators to clips.\n   * Added subtitle formats for labels.

From it, you can switch between Beats & Measures or hh:mm:ss timeline rulers, set various preferences regarding to looping, as well as playhead behaviors: \"Scroll view to playhead\" (previously: \"Update display while playing\") and \"Continuous scrolling\" (previously: Pinned Play Head).\n   * Improved BSD support. (Thanks, Brad Smith!)\n   * macOS: Changed the Audacity.app icon on macOS to fit new design guidelines.\n   * Reordered some menus. \n   * Moved OK/Cancel buttons of effects to the bottom.\n\n  Removals\n\n  There have been a number of removals of niche features to simplify the app. This should make the app a bit less overwhelming to use, and also will speed up future development as fewer things need to be considered.\n   * Removed the read-only mouse preferences page.\n   * Removed Printing options. \n   * Removed Screenshot tool. To make a screenshot, use Win+Shift+S (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+4 (Mac) instead. \n   * Removed Karaoke view.\n   * Removed the \"solo=none\" preference.\n   * Removed timeline tooltips preference.\n   * Removed \"dragging selection edges\" preference.\n   * Removed some warning dialogs and associated preferences.\n   * Removed \"scrolling left of zero\" preference.\n   * Replaced \"Advanced Vertical Zooming\" with new always-on behavior.\n   * Removed some vertical zoom presets.\n   * Removed EQ XML to TXT converter, which was needed for the Audacity 2.3 -> 2.4 transition. It is now a plugin instead, downloadable at https://plugins.audacityteam.org/additional-resources/eq-curves/eq-xml-to-txt-converter. \n   * Removed the \"Vocal reduction and isolation\" effect. As a replacement on Windows and Linux, the Intel OpenVINO plugins work better and on a wider array of content, including mono tracks. The old effect still can be downloaded from https://plugins.audacityteam.org/nyquist-plugins/effect-plugins/filters-and-eq#vocal-reduction-and-isolation\n\n  Bugfixes\n\n   * Fixed a number of dialogs that were able to grow too large to fit on the screen.\n   * #2133 Fixed the playback cursor sometimes desynchronizing with actual playback.

(#1571)\n\nChanges in version 3.0.4:\n\n This is a hotfix release. Fixed a bug with envelope points, which could multiply uncontrollably and cause Audacity to crash. In particular:\n\n\t#1476: Envelope points are multiplied when using Filter Curve EQ or Graphic EQ\n\t#1477: Filter Curve EQ will crash if there is an envelope point outside of the selection\n\t(bug numbers now refer to Github issues and no longer bugzilla bugs)\n\nChanges in version 3.0.3:\n\n Windows version is now 64-bit\n\t(Note: 32-bit plug-ins will not work on 64-bit Audacity)\n\tA 32-bit build of 3.0.3 remains available for download\n Improved default spectrogram colors\n We now provide an official binary for Linux in the form of an AppImage\n Update checking: Audacity can now check to see if there is a newer version available (this is disabled by default on self-compiled builds)\n Error reporting: this is a new dialog where users can choose to send us the details of a serious error\n Multiple bugs fixed, including:\n\n\tP1 2754 - Change Tempo & Pitch and Sliding Stretch with selected audio in negative time crash Audacity on windows (error on Mac)\n\tP1 2772 - Audacity crashes after failing to open corrupt project\n\tP1 2793 - AUP3 projects fail to compact if project's path contains a single-quote\n\tP1 2803 - Audacity unresponsive after 'Fit to Height'\n\tP1 2805 - Audacity fails to export metadata with MP3 files\n\n\nChanges in version 3.0.2:\n\n 3.0.2 fixes over 30 bugs, mostly conconcerned about the new aup3 files, as well as unicode support.

They were always on in 2.3.0.\n        * The advanced vertical zooming option is now available in the\n          View->Zoom menu.\n    * Regular interval labels now support range labels.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n Over 20 bugs in 2.3.0 fixed, including:\n\n    * A crashing bug on Linux that made Audacity 2.3.0. unsuitable for Linux.\n    * Crash on Mac when right clicking on label.\n    * Problems with Change Pitch, including not remembering parameter values.\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.3.0:\n\nImprovements\n\n    * New feature - \"Punch and Roll Recording\".\n    * Pinned-play-head can now be repositioned by dragging\n    * Play-at-Speed now can be adjusted whilst playing.\n    * Toolbars controlling volume and speed can now be resized for greater\n      precision\n    * Macros (formerly 'Chains') substantially extended\n        * New Macro palette\n        * Macros can be bound to keyboard keys\n    * New commands\n        * New 'Tools' menu\n        * New 'Scriptables' commands\n    * Nyquist gains AUD-DO command\n    * Nyquist effects are now translatable and translated\n    * More dialogs have help buttons now\n    * Increased legibility of trackname display\n    * Half-wave option for collapsed tracks\n    * Sliding Stretch\n    * Dialog (option) for entering labels\n\nBug Fixes\n\n    Over 90 bugs in 2.2.2 fixed, including:\n\n    * Windows: Queen Mary 1.7.1 Vamp plug-ins crash Audacity on opening\n      Plug-in Manager - bug #1244\n    * Inconsistent behavior when recording with a selection defined - bug #1839\n    * Ctrl + M does not open label for editing - bug #1852\n    * Vertical Zoom in by clicking in the vertical Scale, or context menu, in\n      waveform views is inconsistent - bug #1810\n    * Deletion of all tracks cannot be undone - bug #1845\n    * Timer Record with a selection present can get a truncated recording with\n      data loss - bug #1851\n    * Duplicate shortcuts can be created - bug #1786\n    * Labels longer than 260 characters are now supported - bug #1905\n    * Using Spectrogram Settings in TCP or using Preferences causes Audacity\n      to reset Project Rate to default rate in Quality Preferences - bug #1977\n    * Cut Preview should play all selected/sync-locked tracks, respecting\n      Mute/Solo during preview - bug #231\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.2.2:\n\nImprovements\n\n    * Dropout detection\n      Dropout detection is controlled from a setting in Recording Preferences\n      called \"Detect dropouts\".\n      When this setting is \"on\" (default setting) Audacity will detect dropouts\n      (brief gaps in the recording) and will insert zeroes into the recording\n      to keep the other good parts synchronized. These silent spans will make\n      the dropouts more obvious, but keep the duration of the recording correct.\n      When recording stops, a Warning message box alerts the user and a label track,\n      called \"Dropouts\", is added showing the lost parts, labeled with consecutive numbers.\n    * Improved horizontal zooming\n      For this release we have improved the way zooming using your mouse wheel\n      works and provided a new Zoom Toggle function.\n    * Improved vertical zooming\n      We have added a context menu to the vertical scale to control vertical zooming\n      Previous vertical zooming methods (left-click in the vertical ruler, left-drag\n      in the vertical ruler) remain available by selecting \"Advanced Vertical Zooming\"\n      in Track Behaviors Preferences.\n    * \"Extra\" menu\n      The \"Ext-Bar\" and \"Ext-Command\" menus have been consolidated into the \"Extra\" menu.\n    * Theme tweaks\n      The appearance and/or contrast of a few icons has been improved.\n    * Easier access to changing key bindings for shortcuts\n      For menu commands that are enabled (not grayed-out) if you hold the Shift key\n      and click on the sub-menu item, instead of executing the command the Keyboard\n      Preferences pop open at the chosen command. You can then change that (or any\n      other) shortcut binding.\n    * Language selection in Preferences\n      Interface Preferences has been upgraded so when selecting languages the proper\n      spelling of these languages is shown with accented and special characters.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n   * Multiple use of \"Save As\" to the existing open project can result in data\n     corruption/loss\n   * Crash undoing during record, using Discard button of History window\n   * Exporting audio in compressed formats to device with insufficient space produces\n     inconsistent/truncated results\n   * In Export Multiple, Cancel does not remove the file that is in progress when\n     Cancel is chosen\n   * Unicode page encodings fixed ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n   * Crash using SBSMS pitch change at low sample rate\n   * (Mac) Equalization: \"Telephone\" curve displays a flat line, no sound on Preview\n   * Toolbars: open undocked if previously not shown, unless Reset Toolbars first\n   * Analysis effects that create labels should give focus to label track\n   * Control value may be out of range when using FloatingPointValidator\n   * Analysis effects produce false indication that a label is open for editing\n   * Import Uncompressed File Dialog Incorrect Reference to Menu Item\n   * Wave Color not grayed out in TCP dropdown menu when in Spectrogram view\n   * Hover indication on note track channel toggle appears on all tracks (when\n     they rerender)\n   * Installer has old logo for 2.2.1 and 2.2.0\n   * Un-muting with a single track unnecessarily activates the Solo button\n   * Applying chain to file should zoom-to-fit\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.2.1:\n\nImprovements\n\n    * Waveform colorways\n      You can optionally change the colorway of the waveforms displayed in your project.\n      The setting is per track and not per project so you can have multiple colorways\n          in the same project.\n    * \"Save Other\" reverts to \"Export\" in the File menu\n      When we made the menu changes for 2.2.0 we introduced an entry into the File menu\n      called \"Save Other\" which led to a sub-menu for exporting various audio formats.\n      Many users were confused by this change and found it hard to find where they could\n      export audio from. So for 2.2.1 we have changed that menu entry to be File > Export.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n   * Release 2.2.1 was mainly a maintenance release.\n     Soon after the release of 2.2.0 we discovered some problematical bugs in Audacity:\n       Bug #1767 - Opening a second project from Mac's Finder produces a second\n         inaccessible instance of Audacity\n       Bug #1770 - Crash applying certain chain files\n       Bug #1783 - Preview fails when selection extends before zero\n       Bug #1787 - Auto-scroll stopped working in 2.2.0\n       Bug #1765 - Using File > Open to import audio gives wrong zoom level\n         and no scroll bar slider\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.2.0:\n\n    * Four Selectable themes provided, with new 'Light' theme as default,\n      plus option to customize\n    * Many menu changes:\n        * Menus Reorganized\n        * Extended menu bar provided\n        * New keyboard commands for working with clips\n    * Help buttons ? in Preferences, Effects, Generators and Analyzers - and\n      other places\n    * Non-Greying out of effects when no selection (and explanatory dialog\n      with help button)\n    * Playback of MIDI (and Allegro) files imported into Note Tracks is\n      now available.\n    * 'Center' option in Selection Toolbar\n    * Stem plots\n    * Major overhaul to documentation/manual including many new images and\n      streamlined text on landing pages for in-program help.\n\nOther Changes\n\n    * Append-record is now the default (use Shift + Record for old behavior,\n\tto record on a new track)\n    * The Esc key now cancels all click-and-drag actions. It also chooses among\n      overlapping mouse click targets, which is especially useful in the Multi-Tool.\n    * Sync-Lock button removed (use menu item or keyboard shortcut instead)\n    * New preferences and preference pages\n    * Overhaul of much code:\n        * Overhaul of envelope handling code to deal with some anomalies\n        * Overhaul of exception handling for greater safety\n   *  New Logo\n\nBug Fixes\n\n   * Major work on bug fixing. 198 bugs that were in 2.1.3 were fixed for 2.2.0.\n        * The most serious bug fixed this time round was bug 437 which was\n          about what happens when Audacity is recording and runs out of storage.\n        * Most of the bugs fixed were more minor, such as bug 463 which was\n          about a case in which the numbering on the timeline could display\n          incorrect times.\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.1.3:\n\n * Interface:\n   * (macOS) Support for horizontal scroll on Magic Mouse / Trackpad and for\n     Trackpad pinch/expand zoom gestures.\n   * Pinned option on waveform makes waveform move and recording/playing head\n     stay still.\n   * Timer Record options to save/export/exit after recording.\n   * Scrub Ruler and optional Scrub Toolbar.\n   * New shortcuts ALT+RIGHT and ALT+LEFT (move to labels without editing).\n\n * Effects:\n   * Effects no longer grayed out when paused.\n   * New Distortion effect (replaces Leveller).\n   * SBSMS (higher quality but slower) option on Change Tempo / Change Pitch\n     effects.\n   * New Rhythm Track generator (replaces Click Track).\n   * New Generator for Sample Data Import.\n   * Nyquist effects now significantly faster.\n\n * Other Changes:\n   * Upgraded the PortAudio library to v19 rev r1966.

You can also create\n      or adjust frequency selections in a new \"Spectral Selection Toolbar\"\n      (available at View > Toolbars).\n   * Transcription Toolbar (Play-at-speed) can now loop play and cut-preview.\n   * Timer Record now saves recordings automatically into an existing project.\n   * New Armenian translation.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n * Interface:\n   * Typing \"j\" or \"k\" in a label track activated the \"move cursor\" shortcut.\n   * Spectrogram log (f) view displayed incorrectly until vertically zoomed.\n   * Fixed crash after zooming out on vertical scale beyond +/-1.0.\n   * Selections made with Selection Toolbar were not restored after Undo.\n   * Undo could fail silently if a selection included/touched a clip boundary.\n\n * Imports and Exports\n   * If there were invalid FFmpeg libs in system PATH this prevented Audacity\n      recognising the installed FFmpeg or the FFmpeg specified in audacity.cfg.\n\n * Mac OS X:\n   * Fix uninitialized buffer - this should correct playback buzz or crackle\n      where the upper of multiple tracks started with or contained white space.\n   * Device names were corrupted when using system language other than English.\n   * Fixed crashes using (external program).\n   * Waves v9 Audio Units should now work correctly.\n\n * GNU/Linux:\n   * Fix \"Audacity already running\" error when using the command-line or\n      context menu to open multiple or further files.\n   * Fix segfault exporting an FFmpeg format to an unwritable folder.\n   * Fix silent failure exporting FFmpeg, MP2 or OGG to an unwritable folder.\n   * Fix ENTER activated an effect when OK button was greyed out.\n\n * Operating system and sound device support:\n   * (Windows) Audacity 2.1.0 requires Windows XP SP3 (32-bit) or XP SP2\n      (64-bit), Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 or 8.1.\n   * (Windows) Audacity is now compiled using Visual Studio 2013.\n   * (Windows) Recording with WASAPI host now includes experimental support\n      for physical inputs (up to 24-bit depth) as well as loopback recording.\n   * (OS X) 10.10 (Yosemite) is now supported including Apple Audio Units.\n   * Please report any issues with WASAPI recording/playback or Yosemite\n      to http://www.audacityteam.org/contact/#feedback .\n   * (Linux Ubuntu) Under Unity, keyboard shortcuts are not visible in the\n     Audacity menus. Keyboard shortcuts are visible if you install the classic\n     GNOME Flashback interface or under Unity if you open Audacity with the\n     UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 environment variable. Audacity compiled from source\n     will ship with src/audacity.desktop.in set to UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 but it\n     will remain up to distributions to use this desktop file.\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.0.6:\n\n * Interface:\n   * Redesigned, searchable Keyboard Preferences with Tree, Name and Key views.\n   * Edit Menu: \"Cut\" and \"Delete\" are now in the top level of the menu.\n   * Transport Menu now includes \"Play/Stop\" and \"Play/Stop and Set Cursor\"\n      (use Keyboard Preferences to create shortcuts for \"Play\" and \"Stop\").\n   * Tracks Menu now includes \"Mix and Render to New Track\".\n   * Track Drop-Down Menu now has Move Track To Top and Move Track To Bottom.\n   * New right-click menu choice \"Delete Label\" to remove single labels.\n   * \"Snap To\" now offers choice of snap to the \"closest\" or \"prior\" position.\n      Note: the previous \"Snap To On\" keyboard shortcut will no longer work.\n   * \"Snap To\" settings are now independent for each project.\n\n * Effects:\n   * Truncate Silence: redesigned with simpler option \"Truncate Detected\n      Silence\" to shorten to the specified length without compressing silence.\n   * VST effects: New \"Settings\" dialog lets you specify buffer size (for\n      faster processing) and enable buffer delay compensation (to prevent\n      inserted silence). Compensation may cause a crash in a few plug-ins.\n   * VST effects now support standard FXP presets.\n   * LV2 effects are now supported on all platforms (textual interface only).\n\n * Import or export using FFmpeg now requires FFmpeg 1.2 or later (or libav\n    0.8 or later). For recommended downloads of recent FFmpeg please visit:\n    http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#ffdown .\n * New Tamil translation (largely complete).\n * (Windows) FLAC exports can now exceed 2 GB in size.\n * (OS X) Easier Audacity installation using the DMG: drag the Audacity folder\n    to the /Applications shortcut.\n * (OS X) Audacity 2.0.6 will not officially support OS X 10.10 Yosemite when\n    released (in particular, Apple Audio Units may not open in Audacity).\n * (Linux) Self-compiled builds of Audacity now search for system LADSPA\n    effects in /usr/lib/ladspa.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n * Interface:\n   * Region Restore did not restore the region after using Preferences.\n   * Dragging selections with the keyboard or Selection Toolbar digits\n      was very slow.\n   * (Windows) Help > About Audacity crashed when run in Magyar language.\n   * (OS X) Some full and reduced Menu Bar items were not translated.\n   * (OS X and Linux) Fixed various interface crashes.\n\n * Effects:\n   * Reverb and Paulstretch were missing from Chains.\n   * Analyze > Contrast could report very inaccurate rms levels.\n   * Noise Removal: Attack and decay times were half as long as set.\n   * (OS X and Linux) Nyquist effects ran much more slowly than on Windows.\n\n * Click or drag on the Timeline after Loop Play continued to loop.\n * Transcription Toolbar did not play slower than 0.1x speed.\n * (Linux) Audacity did not build if python 2 was not available.\n * Projects did not reopen correctly if they contained tracks having\n   2^31 samples or greater of audio (just over 13.5 hours at 44100 Hz).\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.0.5:\n\n * Tracks Menu:\n   * The separate commands that aligned track start or end with the cursor or\n      with selection start are combined into \"Cursor/Selection Start\" commands.\n   * \"Align and Move Cursor\" renamed to \"Move Selection when Aligning\".\n\n * Label Tracks:\n   * Labels Editor now allows empty labels to be saved on closing the editor.\n   * TAB and SHIFT+TAB when the label track has focus now always move forwards\n      or backwards respectively to the nearest label.\n\n * (Windows) On a very few machines, the Windows WDM-KS low latency audio host\n    introduced in Audacity 2.0.4 caused Audacity to hang or the computer to\n    crash. WDM-KS has been removed from 2.0.5 until it can be safely enabled.\n\n * (Windows and OS X) Screen reader improvements for Install VST Effects dialog.\n\n * (OS X) Audio Unit plug-ins detected by Audacity on launch are now not loaded\n    until chosen from the Effect menu. This should speed up launch and avoid\n    crashes at launch due to misbehaving Audio Units.\n\n * (Linux) Update to PortAudio r1910 fixes memory and other bugs under ALSA.\n\n * (Linux) Applied fix for wxGTK 2.8.12 bug which resulted in loss of Audacity's\n    menu bar (or visual corruption under Unity) on Debian-based systems.\n\n Bug fixes:\n\n * Shaped dither was corrupted and too loud on all stereo exports except FLAC.\n\n * Keyboard Preferences: some Edit and Align commands for different sub-menus\n    showed the same name.\n\n * Recordings stopped with \"Stop and Set Cursor\" shortcut could not be undone.\n\n * In locales that use comma for decimal separator:\n    * Text boxes with slider in Nyquist effects only produced whole numbers\n       when using comma to enter a fractional number. Text boxes without\n       slider still have this problem.\n    * Built-in generators produced silence after running a Nyquist effect.\n\n * (Windows) When first changing to Windows WASAPI host, the input volume slider\n    in Mixer Toolbar was enabled when it should have been permanently disabled.\n\n * (Windows) On some machines, launching Audacity then recording from the current\n    Device Toolbar input would not record until the input was reselected.\n\n * (OS X) Frequent crashes occurred on importing audio files on some machines.\n\n * (OS X) Files did not open using Finder \"Open with\", double-clicking the\n    file or dragging the file to the Audacity icon.\n\n * (Linux 64-bit) Fixed a crash when using Equalization.\n\n * (Linux) It was not possible to open an effect or other dialog then navigate\n    through the dialog using TAB.\n\n * (Linux) The Play shortcut did not play a read-directly WAV, AIFF or FLAC\n    import if the warning for importing uncompressed files appeared.\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.0.4:\n\n * New \"Reverb\" effect to replace GVerb, based on the original \"Freeverb\".\n * New View > Go to Selection Start and Go to Selection End commands.\n * New \"Align End to End\" command to append existing tracks to each other.\n * Change Tempo now supports fractional BPM.\n * Plot Spectrum now supports FFT sizes up to 65536.\n * WAV files now support \"Album Title\", \"Track Number\" and \"Genre\" LIST INFO\n    tags and also support ID3 tags.\n * Handle a bug in older iPods or some OS X applications that cause them to\n    refuse AIFF files whose metadata contains an uneven number of characters,\n * (Windows) Added support for \"Windows WDM-KS\" host which can provide very\n    low latencies if you reduce \"Audio to Buffer\" in Recording Preferences.\n * (Windows Vista and later) You can now record computer playback by choosing\n    the new \"Windows WASAPI\" host in Device Toolbar then a \"loopback\" input.\n * (Windows and Mac OS X): VST scanning dialog now replaced with a dialog\n    for choosing which VST effects to load.\n * (Linux) CTRL + ALT can now be used to smooth samples in Draw Tool.\n * Modules Preferences replaced with a dialog on launch of Audacity\n    enabling you to choose which modules to load.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n * Keyboard Preferences: Shortcuts for Generators, Effects and Analyzers\n    were not exported. All imported shortcut changes were discarded.\n * Equalization curves were corrupted in Graphic EQ mode after switching\n    to/from Draw Curves or after\trunning the effect then reopening it.\n * Change Pitch displayed corrupted values when reducing pitch or editing\n    \"from\" Frequency. Detection was very inaccurate at high sample rates.\n * Bass Boost no longer clips if the track contains 32-bit audio.\n * Auto Duck was excessively slow on older machines.\n * (Windows) Exported MP3 comments tags were not seen by Windows programs.\n * (Windows and OS X) Audacity crashed if you used system quit before\n    file import was complete.\n * (Linux) Equalization crashed Audacity if the XML file was corrupted.\n * (Linux) When configuring effect parameters in \"Edit Chains\", \"Preview\"\n    (not intended to be functional) caused a crash.\n * (Linux) LICENSE.txt and README.txt were wrongly installed in\n     /usr/local/share/doc instead of /usr/local/share/doc/audacity/ .\n * Accessibility: ENTER did not toggle selectedness of a label track unless\n    a label was selected.\n * Numerous other interface fixes.\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.0.3:\n\n * The SoX Resampler library (libsoxr) has replaced libresample in\n    Audacity releases, offering both higher quality and greater speed. .\n\n * Time Tracks new features:\n   * \"Set Range\" now changes only the range of the Time Track,\n      preserving the pitch/speed set by any existing warp points.\n   * Vertical scale added with options for linear and logarithmic\n      display and interpolation.\n   * Upper and lower speed limits will now be remembered when saving\n      and reopening a project in 2.0.3. Warp points in projects saved\n      by previous Audacity versions will be correctly restored in 2.0.3.\n   * Warp points saved in a 2.0.3 project will be preserved if opened\n      in previous versions but playback and display will be incorrect.\n\n * New effects:\n   * Studio Fade Out (uses a filtered \"S\" curve).\n   * Adjustable Fade (accessible effect for creating partial fades\n      and adjustable fade shapes).\n   * Bass and Treble (replaces Bass Boost).\n\n * Real sample rates up to 384000 Hz are now supported for playback\n    and recording in high resolution devices (the maximum is up to\n    192000 Hz for Windows DirectSound host).\n\n * Labeled Regions in Edit Menu is renamed to \"Labeled Audio\" and now\n    allows splits to be placed at point labels. Labeled audio regions\n    that touch without overlapping are treated as separate regions.\n    Overlapping labeled audio regions are treated as a single region.\n\n * Compilation: cmake is required in order to build libsoxr.\n\n * New Croatian translation of Audacity.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n * Crash using Undo whilst time-shifting a track.\n * Crash using Repair if the selection extended into an empty track.\n * Export Multiple didn't prevent export if there was no audio or\n    all audio was muted. This allowed export of small invalid files.\n\n * Time Track:\n   * Loop Play of a speeded-up track inserted silence.\n   * Playback and rendering was significantly inaccurate, creating\n      audible and visual glitches.\n\n * Accessibility:\n   * The mnemonics character \"&\" was read out by screen readers in\n      most of the Preferences choices.\n   * NVDA did not read static text in most dialogs. Text can now be\n      read by using INSERT + B.\n   * JAWS and Window-eyes misread the \"Duration\" control in Silence\n      Generator.\n   * Toolbar buttons could not be pressed by ENTER\n\n * Other interface bug fixes.\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.0.2:\n\n * Duration controls when generating at a point now default to\n    hh:mm:ss + milliseconds format. Selection Toolbar also defaults\n    to that format on first installation or resetting preferences.\n * Toolbars visual improvements:\n   * \"Snap To\" in Selection Toolbar now has an explanatory tooltip.\n   * Device Toolbar tooltips now display the selected device.\n   * Increased default width of Device Toolbar and Meter Toolbar.\n * Improvements and some bug fixes to Nyquist effects, including:\n   * Delay (new option to prevent duration change)\n   * Sample Data Export (new \"L-R on Same Line\" layout option)\n   * Risset Drum (new \"Amplitude\" slider).\n * Importing a labels file writes the file name to the name of the\n    Label Track, and exporting a labels file offers the name of the\n    last Label Track in the project.\n * Removed the \"Audio cache\" option from Directories Preferences\n    due to frequent crash reports. All data operations will now\n    be written to disk and not to RAM.\n * Removed the FFmpeg \"On-Demand\" option from Libraries Preferences\n    (this fixes Audacity not building if configured --without-ffmpeg).\n * Compilation: Progress on making the Modules feature mainstream.\n    Modules can now be individually enabled and disabled in Preferences.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n * Interface:\n   * \"Retain labels\" Interface Preference did not retain labels for\n      a region that snapped exactly to both label edges.\n   * Projects did not save the track selected state.\n   * (OS X, Linux) Timer Record: Interlinking of the Start, End and\n      Duration controls was broken.\n   * (Windows) JAWS screen-reader did not read the \"Draw curves\" and\n      \"Graphic EQ\" radio buttons in Equalization correctly.\n\n * Envelopes and Clips:\n   * Exporting (or any render operation) on a track containing\n      split lines could create clicks at the split lines.\n   * Dragging a clip into another track caused a crash if Sync-Lock\n      Tracks was enabled and there was also a label track.\n\n * Effects and Analysis:\n   * Normalize could crash if the track name contained \"%\".\n\n\n\nChanges in version 2.0.1:\n\n * Shortcuts can now be added in Keyboard Preferences to items in the\n    Generate, Effect or Analyze menus, including user-added plug-ins.\n\n * Nyquist Effect plug-ins can now be added to Chains.\n\n * New \"Paulstretch\" effect for extreme slowdown without pitch change.\n\n * New \"Sample Data Export\" Analyze effect for exporting a file\n    containing amplitude values for each sample in the selection.\n\n * New Preference (off by default) to import files On-Demand (without\n    seek ability) when using the optional FFmpeg library.\n\n * New Preference (off by default) to retain labels when deleting a\n    selection that snaps to the label without extending past it.\n\n * (Windows installer) New option to reset Preferences on next launch.\n\n * (Mac) Audacity now has excellent compatibility with the VoiceOver\n     screen reader. For details, please see:\n     http://manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/man/accessibility.html#mac .\n\n * CleanSpeech Mode (no longer supported) will not now be enabled\n    even if it was enabled by an earlier version of Audacity.\n\n * Added Serbian (Latin and Cyrillic) translations.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n * Interface:\n   * Selection Toolbar: a value for the previous whole second\n      displayed if the value was close to a whole second.\n   * Finding zero crossings could cause the selection to expand into\n      white space at either side of the clip.\n   * Clips did not drag to another track if mouse was over a selection.\n   * Mixer Board: Rendering four tracks resulted in a redundant Track\n      Strip followed by a crash.\n\n * Imports, Exports and Files:\n   * Exporting to WAV or AIFF led to a \"Libsndfile says\" error or\n      corrupted output due to order of metadata in imported files.\n   * (Mac) Fixed crashes importing MP3 files on PPC machines.\n   * (Linux Ubuntu) .Aup files could not be associated with Audacity\n      (they opened in the web browser instead).\n\n * Effects and Analysis:\n   * Normalize: Fixed issues where normalization could be to wrong\n      value if applied with DC offset correction, or if applied to\n      \"read-directly\" WAV and AIFF files before On-Demand completed.\n   * Sliding Time Scale: fixed an audible discontinuity at the\n      beginning of the processed selection; fixed a serious quality\n      problem on Linux 64-bit.\n\n * Other miscellaneous bug fixes, including fix to prevent zooming\n    with mouse wheel or ball scrolling the content off-screen.\n\n\n\nChanges between version 1.3.14 Beta and 2.0.0:\n\n * New Interface preference to show the track name in the display (this\n    is off by default).\n * Longer default Playback preference for effects preview and preview\n    before cut.\n * Restored use of Page Up and Page Down to scroll horizontally.\n\n Bug fixes:\n\n * Interface:\n   * Fixed playback speed and synchronization problems when dragging\n      clips or tracks between tracks having different sample rates.\n   * (Windows) Removed a crash risk where shortcuts could be\n      used to record or import in one project while importing or\n      exporting in another.\n\n * Imports and Exports:\n   * Fixed crashes when changing the sample format of read-directly WAV\n      or AIFF files using the Track Drop-Down Menu.\n   * Fixed a crash importing MP3 files that had duplicate metadata tags\n      (this is a bug in current libsndfile which has been patched in\n       Audacity; MP3 files mislabeled as WAV which have duplicate tags\n       will still crash Audacity on Linux if Audacity has been compiled\n       against an affected version of system libsndfile).\n   * Fixed an issue where excessively high or corrupted sample values in\n      the audio could corrupt exports from the start of the problem for\n      the rest of the file, and could corrupt the rest of the project.\n   * (Linux) Fixed Audacity could not be compiled against FFmpeg\n      0.7.x and 0.8.x.\n\n * Effects and Analysis:\n   * Fixed crash on launch when using \"Ambisonic Decoders (PC)\" VST\n      plug-ins and other plug-ins that enable additional floating point\n      exceptions.\n   * Fixed Plot Spectrum background could be transparent on some machines.\n   * Bug fixes for Click Track, High Pass, Low Pass and Vocal Remover.\n   * Chirp, Tone and Silence generators now remember their settings.\n\n * Other miscellaneous bug fixes.\n\n\n\nSummary of bug fixes and new features between 1.2.6 and 2.0.0:\n\n * New features: There are dozens of new features in 2.0.0, including:\n\n   * Many effects significantly improved, especially Equalization, Noise\n      Removal and Normalize. Vocal Remover now included plus GVerb on\n      Windows and Mac. VAMP analysis plug-ins now supported.\n   * Improved label tracks with Sync-Lock Tracks feature in the Tracks Menu.\n      Multiple clips per track. Tracks and selections can be fully\n      manipulated using the keyboard. Many more keyboard shortcuts.\n   * New Device Toolbar to manage inputs and outputs. Timer Record feature.\n      New Mixer Board view with per-track VU meters.\n   * Automatic Crash Recovery in the event of abnormal program termination.\n   * Fast \"On-Demand\" import of WAV/AIFF files if read directly from source.\n      FLAC now fully supported. Added support for optional FFmpeg library\n      for import/export of AC3/M4A/WMA and import of audio from video files.\n\n   Please visit http://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/ for a full\n   list of features in 2.0.0. You can click Help > Manual (in web browser)\n   in the program to read more.\n\n * Bug Fixes:\n\n   * Labels now accept lower case \"z\".\n   * (Windows Vista/7) Pressing Stop after recording could cause a crash.\n   * (Mac OS X) Fixed shortcut keys activating when typing in file open or\n      save windows.\n   * (Mac OS X) Audacity 2.0.0 fully supports Unicode, which fixes an\n      issue where Audacity could not work with folders having non-English\n      characters in their name.\n   * (Linux) Playing existing tracks while recording in mono could cause\n      recordings to be distorted or low-pitched.\n\n\n\nChanges in version 1.3.14 Beta:\n\n * Normalize: Faster processing and improved interface. Left-right balance\n    in unsplit stereo tracks is now preserved by default, with a checkbox\n    option provided to process stereo channels independently.\n * Spectrograms now allow window sizes up to 32768 and frequencies up to\n    half the sample rate (the maximum possible).\n * Mix and Render now preserves clip length by not rendering white space\n    between time zero and first audio, and preserves audio before time zero.\n    To retain silence before the audio starts, generate silence after render.\n * Grouped some Edit Menu items into \"Remove Audio\" and \"Clip Boundaries\".\n * CleanSpeech Mode removed from Interface Preferences (it still runs if it\n    was enabled in a previous Audacity but can only be turned off there).\n * (OS X) Added support for AudioUnit MusicEffects (but no MIDI support).\n * (Linux) Set the per-user files directory per the program name set in\n    configure.\n * (Linux) Changed the default location of the Audacity temporary directory\n    to be in /var/tmp not /tmp, so preserving the directory between reboots.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n * Interface:\n   * Excessive delay occurred when typing into labels in long projects.\n   * Last digit of TimeText controls could not be manipulated in some formats.\n   * (Windows, OS X) Play and Record shortcuts did not work after clicking in\n      Device Toolbar.\n   * (OS X, Linux) Crash occurred if Toolbars were reset during playback or\n      recording.\n\n * Imports and Exports:\n   * MP2 files were not importable without FFmpeg library or an import rule.\n   * Files that could only be imported using FFmpeg imported as noise with\n      no error message if FFmpeg was not available.\n   * Files containing PCM audio but an incorrect extension (such as MP3)\n      caused a freeze.\n\n * Effects and Analysis:\n   * An empty command could be added to a Chain which then displayed a\n      Nyquist error message when run.\n   * Plot Spectrum didn't preserve signal level if multiple tracks were\n      analyzed.\n\n * Other bug fixes:\n   * Audacity has been provisionally fixed so that it can no longer create\n      block files longer than the sample format or project format allows,\n      and can no longer delete these, which led to data loss. Any overlong\n      blocks found are preserved but \"orphaned\", so will appear as silence.\n   * Orphan block files were wrongly reported if cutting or copying to\n      the clipboard then reopening the project in the same session.\n   * Fixed some crashes and incorrect movement of audio when dragging tracks.\n   * (Windows) Data loss is now prevented when encountering a corrupted\n      .aup file created in ANSI builds.\n   * (Linux) Restore building if USE_PORTMIXER is not defined.\n\n\n\nChanges in version 1.3.13 Beta:\n\n * Control Toolbar renamed to Transport Toolbar.\n * Device Toolbar (on by default) now contains all input and output device\n    choices, including host and recording channels. Input/output choices are\n    no longer in Mixer Toolbar on Windows XP or some older operating systems.\n    New Transport > Rescan Audio Devices menu item to refresh the device list.\n * New \"Sync-Lock Tracks\" feature (turned on in the Tracks menu) to allow\n    groups of audio and/or label tracks to retain synchronisation when the\n    track length changes.\n * Equalization: New \"Manage Curves\" dialog for importing and exporting curves.\n * Noise Removal: New \"Sensitivity\" slider to adjust the noise threshold, and\n    new option to isolate noise.\n * New \"Extended Import\" Preferences for specifying different importers to\n    open specific file extensions.\n * Improved Automatic Crash Recovery with all project changes autosaved.\n * MIDI tracks can be vertically zoomed, time shifted and display bar lines.\n    Note: the channel selection buttons are not available in 1.3.13.\n * (Windows and Linux) The window Close button and other system close or\n    shutdown commands now quit on closing the last window. File > Close now\n    always clears to a new, empty project.\n * (OS X) Simpler installer with top-level \"Audacity\" folder.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n * Interface:\n   * Cutting or copying from a track at a given sample rate into a track\n      at another rate resulted in speed-changed audio.\n   * Generating inside a clip could modify the clip length or create\n      spurious clips.\n   * Recorded stereo tracks were only half the height of imported or\n      generated stereo tracks. Imported stereo files had a \"1\" appended\n      to the track name.\n   * Edit > Region Save did not save the cursor position.\n   * (Windows) Projects crashed when clicking rapidly inside the interface\n      or when applying repeated effects towards the end of audio tracks.\n   * (Windows) Some Unicode characters could not be typed into labels,\n      or caused a freeze using some input methods.\n   * (OS X) Crash when quitting an empty project window, or when closing the\n      main project window while a progress dialog was on screen.\n   * Numerous other interface fixes including Dependencies dialog,\n      Keyboard Preferences and spurious lines drawn on waveform.\n\n * Imports and Exports:\n   * Support added for later versions of the optional FFmpeg library up to\n      current FFmpeg HEAD. This should significantly improve FFmpeg support\n      on Linux. FFmpeg downloads for Windows and Mac updated to v0.6. This\n      fixes mono AAC files importing as stereo, though current 0.5 versions\n      of FFmpeg will still work.\n   * Both FFmpeg and LAME should now be properly detected even when other\n      versions of those libraries exist on the system.\n   * New warning (on by default) for importing uncompressed audio files.\n      Better error messages when read-directly uncompressed files are missing.\n   * Imported ID3v2 metadata tags were removed when exporting without the\n      Metadata Editor appearing (for example, when using an export command\n      in Chains). Note: As a result of this fix, ID3v1 tags must now be\n      written by exporting using (external program) and an installed LAME.\n   * U-Law/A-Law files with WAV headers now use the standard 18 byte fmt chunk,\n      so should now be recognised by most telephony applications.\n   * Variable bit rate MP3s exported using \"MP3 Files\" were larger than\n      necessary because using the bit reservoir was disabled.\n   * (OS X) Files imported from iTunes could create invalid characters in the\n      .aup project file, causing an error when re-opening the project. Note:\n      An error \"reference to invalid character number\" will still occur if\n      re-opening a project created in previous Betas that contains such\n      characters. To fix the issue, open a back-up copy of the .aup file in a\n      text editor, turn off word wrap, then in the line indicated in the error\n      message, remove the string of characters that starts with &# and ends\n      with a semi-colon (;).\n\n * Other bug fixes:\n   * Nyquist effects: fixes for crashes, incorrect slider behaviour and better\n      support for backslashes, double quotes and Unicode characters.\n   * (Windows and OS X) Processing of VST effects was substantially slower than\n      in previous versions of Audacity.\n   * (OS X 10.5 PPC) A first-time installation of Audacity Beta would hang\n      on launch if VST effects were detected.\n   * (Linux) Recordings made with the pulse device crashed or stalled when\n      using overdub and/or software playthrough.\n   * (Linux) Play-at-Speed crashed at 0.08 speed or lower if Audacity was\n      configured with libsamplerate.\n\n\n\nChanges in version 1.3.12 Beta:\n\n * A hover tooltip is now provided if the Mixer Toolbar input selector\n    cannot control the system slider for the selected input.\n * More intuitive behavior when moving and resizing labels by dragging\n * Support added for importing lists of files (LOF) containing relative\n    paths\n * Export Multiple: new option to use a numerical prefix before existing\n    label or track names;

some built-in effects (Repair, Equalization)\n  and fixes to others\no New features and bug fixes for Nyquist\no Restructured Preferences dialog\no Improved batch processing\no File format export improvements\no Timer recording\no Intel Mac support\n\n\n\nChanges in 1.3.0:\n\n   New features\n   The new features in Audacity 1.3 have been grouped into the\n   following six major categories.\n\n   1. Collapse/Expand Tracks\n      In Audacity 1.3, every track has an upward-pointing triangle at\n      the bottom of the label area on the left side of the track.\n\n   2. Multiple clips per track\n      In Audacity 1.2, there is one audio 'clip' per track. There is\n      no easy way to time-shift part of a track without moving the\n      rest. In Audacity 1.3, you can split a single track into multiple\n      clips. You can move these clips around between different tracks,\n      making it easy to construct complex compositions out of hundreds\n      of smaller audio samples.\n\n   3. Selection Bar\n      In Audacity 1.2, the current selection is contained in a\n      status bar at the bottom of the window. In Audacity 1.3,\n      this is replaced by a fully functional Selection Bar, which\n      displays and controls the current selection (your choice of\n      Start and End, or Start and Length), and the current audio\n      position. The selection bar is fully editable - just click\n      in any field and type to change the current selection precisely.\n      In addition, many formatting options allow you to view times in\n      different units, such as samples, CD frames, or NTSC video frames.\n\n   4. Improved Label Tracks\n      Label Tracks are Audacity's way for you to create markings 3\n      and annotations within your project. In Audacity 1.3, Label\n      Tracks are much improved, with support for overlapping labels,\n      and support for modifying both the left and right edge of the\n      label region just by clicking and dragging.\n\n   5. QuickTime and Audio Units on Mac OS X\n      On Mac OS X, Audacity can now import and audio file supported\n      by Apple's QuickTime technology. This includes .MOV and .MP4\n      (AAC) files. Unfortunately encrypted audio files (such as\n      those from the iTunes Music Store) cannot be imported directly\n      into Audacity - Apple does not allow this to be done easily\n      because it would be too easy to circumvent the encryption this way.\n\n      Also on Mac OS X, Audacity now supports Audio Unit plug-ins.\n      Audacity searches for Audio Units in the usual location, in the\n      system or user's Library folder.\n\n   6. Other features\n      Better performance with large projects\n\n      Project integrity check on open\n\n      Transcription toolbar\n\n      Upload\n\n      Batch\n\n      Cut lines\n\n      CleanSpeech\n\n\n\nChanges in 1.2.4:\n\n  * The File menu now includes a list of recent files.\n\n  * The \"Generate Silence\" effect now prompts for a length.\n\n  * Audacity is now built with Vorbis 1.1, which features better encoding\n    quality and file compression.\n\n  * Dragging sound files into the Audacity window now works on Mac OS X\n    and Linux, as well as Windows.  (Before, it worked only on Windows.)\n\n  * The \"View History\" window can now discard old undo levels to save disk\n    space on Windows.  (This previously worked only on Linux and Mac.)\n\n  * \"Preferences\" command is now in Edit menu.\n\n  * \"Plot Spectrum\" command is now in Analyze menu.\n\n  * Opening a project file saved by a later version of Audacity displays\n    an intelligent error message.  Also, trying to import a project file\n    (instead of open it) displays an intelligent error message.\n\n  * Audacity now compiles in Visual C++ .NET 2003.\n\n  * Other minor bug fixes.\n\n  * New or updated translations: Arabic (ar), Czech (cs), Finnish (fi),\n    Hungarian (hu), Japanese (ja), Norwegian (nb), Slovenian (sl),\n    Simplified Chinese (zh_CN), Traditional Chinese (zh_TW).\n\n\n\nChanges in 1.2.3:\n\n  * Fixed a bug that caused recording to stop or display incorrectly\n    after about 50 minutes on some Windows systems.  (This was partly\n    fixed in Audacity 1.2.2, but still didn't work on some systems.)\n\n  * The Change Pitch and Change Tempo effects have been upgraded to\n    use a new version of the SoundTouch library by Olli Parviainen,\n    with better speed and higher quality.\n\n  * libsndfile has been upgraded to version 1.0.11.\n\n  * Fixed a bug that caused the program to run slowly when using the\n    Envelope tool.\n\n  * Shift-clicking on a mute or solo button now un-mutes (or un-solos)\n    all other tracks.\n\n  * Nyquist plug-ins can now accept strings as input.  Also, a \"Debug\"\n    button has been added to Nyquist effect dialogs, which allows you\n    to see all of the output produced by Nyquist, for aid in debugging.\n\n  * When the audio file referenced (\"aliased\") by an Audacity project is\n    missing, Audacity will now always play silence.  Before, Audacity\n    would sometimes repeat the most recent audio that was played previously.\n\n  * VU Meters will now always reset when audio I/O has stopped.\n\n  * Fixed a major Mac-only bug that was causing Audacity to crash at seemingly\n    random times, but especially during audio playback and recording.\n\n  * New or updated translations: Italian (it), Hungarian (hu),\n    Ukrainian (uk), Spanish (es). Polish (pl), Simplified Chinese (zh),\n    Norsk-Bokmal (nb), French (fr).\n\n\n\nChanges in 1.2.2:\n\n  * VU Meters added for both playback and recording.  Click on\n    the recording meter to monitor the input without recording.\n\n  * Export Multiple - new feature that lets you export multiple\n    files at once, either by track, or split based on labels.\n\n  * Attempt to automatically correct latency in full-duplex recordings.\n    (This does not work perfectly, and is not yet supported on all\n    systems.  It will improve in future versions.)\n\n  * Fixed a serious bug that could cause data loss when you save and\n    then reload and re-edit an Audacity project containing repeated\n    or duplicate data.\n\n  * MP3 tags dialog will only pop up the first time you export as\n    MP3; after that it will not pop up again as long as you have\n    filled in at least one tag.\n\n  * You can now add a label at the current playback position - in\n    the Project menu, with a shortcut of Ctrl+M.\n\n  * Clicking on a label now selects all of the tracks, making it\n    easier to use the label track to recall selections.\n\n  * Windows: Fixed a crash in the Time Track \"Set Rate\" command.\n\n  * Fixed a bug that caused problems with recordings over 45 minutes\n    on some Windows systems.\n\n  * Mac OS X: Improved support for the Griffin iMic by fixing a bug\n    that was causing it to always record in mono instead of stereo.\n\n  * Added support for Software Playthrough (listen to what you're\n    recording while recording it, or while monitoring using a VU\n    meter) - this makes it possible, for example, to record using one\n    audio device while listening to it play through a separate device.\n\n  * Unix/Linux: Fixed freeze caused by captured mouse when audio\n    device hangs.  (Audacity may not respond, but it will no longer\n    freeze all of X.)\n\n  * Fixed a cosmetic bug that caused improper waveform display if\n    you tried to open an Audacity project saved on a different\n    platform (e.g., copying a project from a Mac to a PC).\n\n  * Fixed bug that could cause instability when pasting, splitting,\n    or duplicating a label track.\n\n  * You can now change the font of a label track by choosing \"Font...\"\n    from the label track's pop-up menu.\n\n  * Basic printing support has been added.  Currently it scales the\n    entire project to fit exactly on one page.  Try printing in\n    landscape orientation for best results.\n\n  * Mac OS X and Windows: Audacity ships with a newer version (1.0.1)\n    of the Ogg Vorbis encoder.  Vorbis compression will now have higher\n    quality and smaller file sizes.\n\n  * Fix a bug that occasionally caused crashes when applying effects\n    to split tracks.\n\n  * Zoom In / Zoom Out now properly disable when they're not available.\n\n  * Fixed disk memory leak in Preview\n\n  * Other minor bug fixes and performance improvements.\n\n\n\nChanges in 1.2.1:\n\n  * The following translations have been added or updated:  Finnish,\n    French, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Russian.\n\n  * Fix a bug that could cause data to be lost when pasting audio\n    from one project into another, after the first project has been\n    saved and closed.\n\n  * Fix a possible crash when opening or resizing the Equalization\n    window, especially when using large system fonts.\n\n  * Don't allow percentages less than -100% in Change Pitch/Speed/Tempo\n    effects (fixes a possible crash).\n\n  * Fix a crash when the temporary directory is not available on startup.\n\n  * Correctly load ID3 tags saved in Audacity project files.\n\n  * On Linux and OS X, store lockfiles in the temp directory instead of\n    the user's home directory.  This fixes problems in lab environments\n    where users have restricted or network-mounted home directories.\n\n  * Fix a bug that prevented Nyquist effects from running when certain\n    regional settings were activated.\n\n  * Fix a bug in the Quick Mix command that could cause old temporary\n    files to not be deleted.\n\n  * Linux: Fix endianness problems in playback on PowerPC.\n\n  * Linux: Fix compilation problem in Nyquist on MIPS.\n\n  * Linux: Include a more recent PortAudio v19 snapshot (fixes compilation\n    problems when building with the --with-portaudio=v19 option).\n\n  * Two new Nyquist plug-ins: \"Cross Fade In\" and \"Cross Fade Out.\"\n\n  * Other minor bug-fixes.\n\n\n\nChanges in 1.2.0:\n\n  * New cross-fade effects.\n\n  * Fix problem where samples were drawn in the wrong position\n    when zoomed all the way in.  This caused the drawing tool\n    to move a different sample than the one under the cursor.\n\n  * Don't use id3v2.4 tags, which are not yet supported by\n    most players.  (This was fixed in 1.2.0-pre2, but appeared\n    again by accident in 1.2.0-pre3.)\n\n  * Correctly display translated messages in the status bar.\n\n  * When the cursor is on-screen, the Zoom In button now zooms\n    to the area around the cursor.\n\n  * Mac OS X: Fixed audio problems on the Apple PowerMac G5.\n\n  * Linux/ALSA: Work around a bug in ALSA's OSS emulation that\n    caused Audacity's playback cursor to move too quickly.\n\n  * Microsoft Windows: The Audacity source code should now\n    compile out of the box on Windows.\n\n  * Many new/updated translations.\n\n\n\nChanges in 1.2.0-pre4:\n\n  * Fixed problems that could occur when importing certain\n    non-seekable PCM audio files, such as GSM610.\n\n  * Fixed bug that was causing the samples to shift off-screen\n    horizontally when zoomed in very far and the track had a\n    time-shift offset.\n\n  * Fixed bugs in the new resampler that added noise to resampled\n    audio on some systems. If you experienced noise when exporting\n    to a WAV, MP3 or OGG file you may have been bitten by this bug.\n\n  * Fixed bug that led to occasional crashes when using the\n    time-shift tool in conjunction with high zoom factors.\n\n  * Dithering is now only applied on export when it is really\n    necessary (e.g. when converting float samples to 16-bit).\n\n  * Files that only contain mono tracks are now automatically\n    exported to stereo files when they contain tracks which are\n    panned to the left or the right.\n\n  * The Delete key can now be used to delete the current selection,\n    in addition to the Backspace key.\n\n  * Fixed bug where Audacity didn't ask whether to save\n    changes if you close the project or exit while recording.\n\n  * Mac OS X: Supports Playthrough (listen to what you're recording\n    while recording it) if your hardware device supports it.\n\n  * Mac OS X: Audacity is now a package (you can right-click on\n    Audacity.app and select 'Show Package Contents').  Launch time\n    has improved significantly.\n\n  * MS Windows: Fixed problem that caused Windows XP to use\n    the short name of a file (\"TESTFI~1.AUP\"), which led to\n    problems when the file was later opened again using the\n    long file name.\n\n  * MS Windows: Fixed bug that caused file exports to fail\n    if the destination directory was the root folder of a\n    Windows drive.\n\n  * MS Windows: Audacity's application information which\n    is written to the Windows registry now always contains\n    the full path to the executable.\n\n  * MS Windows: Fixed problems in trying to set the Windows\n    registry as non-admin user, for file-type associations.\n\n  * Make sure the \"Save\" command is enabled after changing\n    gain and pan sliders.\n\n  * Updated translations.  Added translator credits to the\n    \"About\" window in localized versions.\n\n\n\nChanges in 1.2.0-pre3:\n\n  * Fixed bug where Export is grayed out when nothing is\n    selected.\n\n  * Fixed crash caused by opening Audacity on a computer with\n    a high-end sound card with no mixer support.\n\n  * Fixed crash in Import Raw.\n\n  * Fixed New Stereo Track.\n\n  * Cosmetic fixes for Mac OS X.\n\n  * Support for the VST Enabler on Windows added.\n\n  * Fixed crash if you close Audacity while the Preferences\n    dialog is open.\n\n  * Fixed duplicate-character bug in Mac OS X Label Tracks.\n\n  * The recording level control on Linux now adjusts the IGAIN,\n    rather than the playthrough level of the recording source.\n\n  * Fixed bug that caused corruption to 16-bit stereo recordings.\n\n  * Fixed bug that caused data loss if you deleted all tracks in\n    a saved project and then open a new file into the same window.\n\n  * Added support for alternate audio button order (in Interface\n    preferences)\n\n  * Added preliminary support for wxX11\n\n  * Added fully transparent Windows XP icon\n\n  * Fixed crash if you try to record (or play) and no audio\n    devices exist, or if the audio device doesn't support the\n    mode you selected.\n\n  * Audacity no longer sets the process priority to high while\n    recording on Windows.

          "content": "There are several ways to contribute to Audacity:\n\n## Developing\n\nAudacity is mostly coded in C++. You'll need to be at least somewhat comfortable in it to start contributing code.\n\nIf you want to develop Audacity:\n\n* Build instructions can be found in the BUILDING.md\n* [Coding standards](https://audacity.gitbook.io/dev/getting-started/coding-standards) and other info on the process can be found [in the dev resources](https://audacity.gitbook.io/dev/).\n* You will need to [sign the CLA](https://www.audacityteam.org/cla/) to contribute code.\n* If you need help, you can ask in the [Audacity dev discord](https://discord.gg/N3XKxzTrq3).\n\n### Developing Plug-ins\n\nAudacity supports a wide variety of plug-in APIs, namely [Nyquist](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/nyquist.html), LV2, Audio Units (macOS only) and VST2 effects. These plug-ins generally won't be shipped as part of Audacity, but they still may be a tremendous help for Audacity users.\n\n## Testing / Finding bugs\n\nYou can download current development builds in the [Actions tab on Github](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/actions). These builds are tied to certain pull requests. As a rule of thumb: If it's not yet merged, report any broken things you find which might be a result of the pull request directly as a comment on the pull request. If the code has been merged, [make a new bug in the issue tracker](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/new/choose).\n\nWhen reporting bugs, try to find the most general form of it. For example, if you encounter a bug when amplifying a clip 2 hours into a project, try to see if it also happens when you're using a different effect (Normalize, for example), and if it also happens if the clip is near the beginning.\n\nBugs must be reproducible. If you can't find steps to reproduce a bug, try asking if you went wrong somewhere [in the Audacity forum](https://forum.audacityteam.org/) instead.\n\n## Translating\n\nSee [our translators page](https://www.audacityteam.org/community/translators/) for more information on how to translate Audacity.\n\n## Feedback & Feature requests\n\nIf you have anything you think Audacity can do better, you can voice it in [the relevant section in the forum](https://forum.audacityteam.org/c/feedback-and-discussion-forum/adding-features-to-audacity/22). If you have a very concrete idea something in the code which should be added or changed, you can also [make an enhancement request in the issue tracker](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Supporting Users\n\nThe most active Audacity user community can be found [in the forum](https://forum.audacityteam.org/), so if you want to help users with their problems, this would be the first stop.\n\n### Making video tutorials\n\nVideo tutorials are very helpful to users, as they tend to be easier to follow than written instructions. When you make video tutorials, make sure to mention which version of Audacity you're using, so that users know what the problem might be should they stumble upon your tutorial after a few years and find that their version of Audacity does very different things to yours.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n###############################################################################\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\n###############################################################################\n\nCreative Commons Legal Code\n\nAttribution 3.0 Unported\n\n    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE\n    LEGAL SERVICES.

ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS\nAUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE\nTO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY\nBE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS\nCONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND\nCONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and\n    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,\n    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a\n    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes\n    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be\n    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\n    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a\n    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\n    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\n    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\n    timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an\n    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\n    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\n    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\n    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and\n    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\n    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\n    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\n    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\n    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this\n    License.\n c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and\n    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or\n    other transfer of ownership.\n d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that\n    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,\n    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work\n    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in\n    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,\n    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\n    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or\n    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer\n    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a\n    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the\n    organization that transmits the broadcast.\n f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms\n    of this License including without limitation any production in the\n    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or\n    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\n    pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work\n    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a\n    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\n    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are\n    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;\n    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or\n    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\n    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied\n    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\n    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a\n    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the\n    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by\n    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise\n    considered a literary or artistic work.\n g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with\n    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\n    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\n    violation.\n h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and\n    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or\n    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital\n    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that\n    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a\n    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\n    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the\n    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to\n    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,\n    sounds or images.\n i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including\n    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of\n    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a\n    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic\n    medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\nlimit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\nlimitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\ncopyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\nLicensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\nexercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n    Collections;\n b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\n    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\n    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made\n    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The\n    original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a\n    modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\n    in Collections; and,\n d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\n        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n        of the rights granted under this License; and,\n   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\n        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\n        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\n        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\n        by You of the rights granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\nknown or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in\nother media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly\ngranted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\n    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\n    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\n    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\n    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\n    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\n    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\n    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n    as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n    Section 4(b), as requested.\n b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n    attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\n    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n    \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay\n    based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by\n    this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\n    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\n    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor\n    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\n    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\n    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\n    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n    but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\nOFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\nKIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\nWHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\nOF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n    stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\n    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n    enforceable.\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\n    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\n    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\n    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\n    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\n    applicable law.\n\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work.
