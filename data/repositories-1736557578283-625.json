This flow was\n   experimental and never documented. It is now officially supported and\n   documented but is not backwards compatible with older Vault releases.\n* Cluster cipher suites: On its cluster port, Vault will no longer advertise\n   the full TLS 1.2 cipher suite list by default. Although this port is only\n   used for Vault-to-Vault communication and would always pick a strong cipher,\n   it could cause false flags on port scanners and other security utilities\n   that assumed insecure ciphers were being used. The previous behavior can be\n   achieved by setting the value of the (undocumented) `cluster_cipher_suites`\n   config flag to `tls12`.\n* API/Agent Renewal behavior: The API now allows multiple options for how it\n   deals with renewals. The legacy behavior in the Agent/API is for the renewer\n   (now called the lifetime watcher) to exit on a renew error, leading to a\n   reauthentication. The new default behavior is for the lifetime watcher to\n   ignore 5XX errors and simply retry as scheduled, using the existing lease\n   duration. It is also possible, within custom code, to disable renewals\n   entirely, which allows the lifetime watcher to simply return when it\n   believes it is time for your code to renew or reauthenticate.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* **Vault Debug**: A new top-level subcommand, `debug`, is added that allows\n   operators to retrieve debugging information related to a particular Vault\n   node. Operators can use this simple workflow to capture triaging information,\n   which can then be consumed programmatically or by support and engineering teams.\n   It has the abilitity to probe for config, host, metrics, pprof, server status,\n   and replication status.\n* **Recovery Mode**: Vault server can be brought up in recovery mode to resolve\n   outages caused due to data store being in bad state. This is a privileged mode\n   that allows `sys/raw` API calls to perform surgical corrections to the data\n   store. Bad storage state can be caused by bugs. However, this is usually\n   observed when known (and fixed) bugs are hit by older versions of Vault.\n* **Entropy Augmentation (Enterprise)**: Vault now supports sourcing entropy from\n   external source for critical security parameters. Currently an HSM that\n   supports PKCS#11 is the only supported source.\n* **Active Directory Secret Check-In/Check-Out**: In the Active Directory secrets\n   engine, users or applications can check out a service account for use, and its\n   password will be rotated when it's checked back in.\n* **Vault Agent Template**: Vault Agent now supports rendering templates containing\n   Vault secrets to disk, similar to Consul Template [[GH-7652](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/7652)]\n* **Transit Key Type Support**: Signing and verification is now supported with the P-384\n   (secp384r1) and P-521 (secp521r1) ECDSA curves [[GH-7551](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/7551)] and encryption and\n   decryption is now supported via AES128-GCM96 [[GH-7555](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/7555)]\n* **SSRF Protection for Vault Agent**: Vault Agent has a configuration option to\n   require a specific header before allowing requests [[GH-7627](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/7627)]\n* **AWS Auth Method Root Rotation**: The credential used by the AWS auth method can\n   now be rotated, to ensure that only Vault knows the credentials it is using [[GH-7131](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/7131)]\n* **New UI Features**: The UI now supports managing users and groups for the\n   Userpass, Cert, Okta, and Radius auth methods.\n* **Shamir with Stored Master Key**: The on disk format for Shamir seals has changed,\n   allowing for a secondary cluster using Shamir downstream from a primary cluster\n   using Auto Unseal. [[GH-7694](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/7694)]\n* **Stackdriver Metrics Sink**: Vault can now send metrics to\n   [Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/).

They will also be returned\n   when doing a read on the role if they were used to provide values initially;\n   however, in Vault 1.4 if `period` or `explicit_max_ttl` is zero they will no\n   longer be returned. (`explicit_max_ttl` was already not returned if empty.)\n* Due to underlying changes in Go version 1.12 and Go > 1.11.5, Vault is now\n   stricter about what characters it will accept in path names. Whereas before\n   it would filter out unprintable characters (and this could be turned off),\n   control characters and other invalid characters are now rejected within Go's\n   HTTP library before the request is passed to Vault, and this cannot be\n   disabled. To continue using these (e.g. for already-written paths), they\n   must be properly percent-encoded (e.g. `\\r` becomes `%0D`, `\\x00` becomes\n   `%00`, and so on).\n* The user-configured regions on the AWSKMS seal stanza will now be preferred\n   over regions set in the enclosing environment.  This is a _breaking_ change.\n* All values in audit logs now are omitted if they are empty.  This helps\n   reduce the size of audit log entries by not reproducing keys in each entry\n   that commonly don't contain any value, which can help in cases where audit\n   log entries are above the maximum UDP packet size and others.\n* Both PeriodicFunc and WALRollback functions will be called if both are\n   provided. Previously WALRollback would only be called if PeriodicFunc was\n   not set. See [[GH-6717](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6717)] for\n   details.\n* Vault now uses Go's official dependency management system, Go Modules, to\n   manage dependencies. As a result to both reduce transitive dependencies for\n   API library users and plugin authors, and to work around various conflicts,\n   we have moved various helpers around, mostly under an `sdk/` submodule. A\n   couple of functions have also moved from plugin helper code to the `api/`\n   submodule. If you are a plugin author, take a look at some of our official\n   plugins and the paths they are importing for guidance.\n* AppRole uses new, common token fields for values that overlap\n   with other auth backends. `period` and `policies` will continue to work,\n   with priority being given to the `token_` prefixed versions of those\n   parameters. They will also be returned when doing a read on the role if they\n   were used to provide values initially.\n* In AppRole, `\"default\"` is no longer automatically added to the `policies`\n   parameter. This was a no-op since it would always be added anyways by\n   Vault's core; however, this can now be explicitly disabled with the new\n   `token_no_default_policy` field.\n* In AppRole, `bound_cidr_list` is no longer returned when reading a role\n* rollback: Rollback will no longer display log messages when it runs; it will\n   only display messages on error.\n* Database plugins will now default to 4 `max_open_connections`\n   rather than 2.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* **Integrated Storage**: Vault 1.2 includes a _tech preview_ of a new way to\n   manage storage directly within a Vault cluster. This new integrated storage\n   solution is based on the Raft protocol which is also used to back HashiCorp\n   Consul and HashiCorp Nomad.\n* **Combined DB credential rotation**: Alternative mode for the Combined DB\n   Secret Engine to automatically rotate existing database account credentials\n   and set Vault as the source of truth for credentials.\n* **Identity Tokens**: Vault's Identity system can now generate OIDC-compliant\n   ID tokens. These customizable tokens allow encapsulating a signed, verifiable\n   snapshot of identity information and metadata.

is a bug fix release containing the two items below. It is otherwise\nunchanged from 1.1.1.\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* auth/okta: Fix a potential dropped error [[GH-6592](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6592)]\n* secrets/kv: Fix a regression on upgrade where a KVv2 mount could fail to be\n   mounted on unseal if it had previously been mounted but not written to\n   [[GH-31](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-kv/pull/31)]\n\n## 1.1.1 (April 11th, 2019)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n* Given: (a) performance replication is enabled; (b) performance standbys are\n   in use on the performance replication secondary cluster; and (c) mount\n   filters are in use, if a mount that was previously available to a secondary\n   is updated to be filtered out, although the data would be removed from the\n   secondary cluster, the in-memory cache of the data would not be purged on\n   the performance standby nodes. As a result, the previously-available data\n   could still be read from memory if it was ever read from disk, and if this\n   included mount configuration data this could result in token or lease\n   issuance. The issue is fixed in this release; in prior releases either an\n   active node changeover (such as a step-down) or a restart of the standby\n   nodes is sufficient to cause the performance standby nodes to clear their\n   cache. A CVE is in the process of being issued; the number is\n   CVE-2019-11075.\n* Roles in the JWT Auth backend using the OIDC login flow (i.e. role_type of\n   “oidc”) were not enforcing bound_cidrs restrictions, if any were configured\n   for the role. This issue did not affect roles of type “jwt”.\n\nCHANGES:\n\n* auth/jwt: Disallow logins of role_type \"oidc\" via the `/login` path [[GH-38](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-jwt/pull/38)]\n* core/acl:  New ordering defines which policy wins when there are multiple\n   inexact matches and at least one path contains `+`. `+*` is now illegal in\n   policy paths. The previous behavior simply selected any matching\n   segment-wildcard path that matched. [[GH-6532](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6532)]\n* replication: Due to technical limitations, mounting and unmounting was not\n   previously possible from a performance secondary. These have been resolved,\n   and these operations may now be run from a performance secondary.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* agent: Allow AppRole auto-auth without a secret-id [[GH-6324](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6324)]\n* auth/gcp: Cache clients to improve performance and reduce open file usage\n* auth/jwt: Bounds claims validiation will now allow matching the received\n   claims against a list of expected values [[GH-41](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-jwt/pull/41)]\n* secret/gcp: Cache clients to improve performance and reduce open file usage\n* replication: Mounting/unmounting/remounting/mount-tuning is now supported\n   from a performance secondary cluster\n* ui: Suport for authentication via the RADIUS auth method [[GH-6488](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6488)]\n* ui: Navigating away from secret list view will clear any page-specific\n   filter that was applied [[GH-6511](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6511)]\n* ui: Improved the display when OIDC auth errors [[GH-6553](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6553)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* agent: Allow auto-auth to be used with caching without having to define any\n   sinks [[GH-6468](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6468)]\n* agent: Disallow some nonsensical config file combinations [[GH-6471](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6471)]\n* auth/ldap: Fix CN check not working if CN was not all in uppercase [[GH-6518](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6518)]\n* auth/jwt: The CLI helper for OIDC logins will now open the browser to the correct\n   URL when running on Windows [[GH-37](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-jwt/pull/37)]\n* auth/jwt: Fix OIDC login issue where configured TLS certs weren't being used [[GH-40](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-jwt/pull/40)]\n* auth/jwt: Fix an issue where the `oidc_scopes` parameter was not being included in\n   the response to a role read request [[GH-35](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-jwt/pull/35)]\n* core: Fix seal migration case when migrating to Shamir and a seal block\n   wasn't explicitly specified [[GH-6455](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6455)]\n* core: Fix unwrapping when using namespaced wrapping tokens [[GH-6536](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6536)]\n* core: Fix incorrect representation of required properties in OpenAPI output\n   [[GH-6490](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6490)]\n* core: Fix deadlock that could happen when using the UI [[GH-6560](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6560)]\n* identity: Fix updating groups removing existing members [[GH-6527](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6527)]\n* identity: Properly invalidate group alias in performance secondary [[GH-6564](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6564)]\n* identity: Use namespace context when loading entities and groups to ensure\n   merging of duplicate entries works properly [[GH-6563](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6563)]\n* replication: Fix performance standby election failure [[GH-6561](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6561)]\n* replication: Fix mount filter invalidation on performance standby nodes\n* replication: Fix license reloading on performance standby nodes\n* replication: Fix handling of control groups on performance standby nodes\n* replication: Fix some forwarding scenarios with request bodies using\n   performance standby nodes [[GH-6538](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6538)]\n* secret/gcp: Fix roleset binding when using JSON [[GH-27](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp/pull/27)]\n* secret/pki: Use `uri_sans` param in when not using CSR parameters [[GH-6505](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6505)]\n* storage/dynamodb: Fix a race condition possible in HA configurations that could\n   leave the cluster without a leader [[GH-6512](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6512)]\n* ui: Fix an issue where in production builds OpenAPI model generation was\n   failing, causing any form using it to render labels with missing fields [[GH-6474](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6474)]\n* ui: Fix issue nav-hiding when moving between namespaces [[GH-6473](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6473)]\n* ui: Secrets will always show in the nav regardless of access to cubbyhole [[GH-6477](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6477)]\n* ui: fix SSH OTP generation [[GH-6540](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6540)]\n* ui: add polyfill to load UI in IE11 [[GH-6567](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6567)]\n* ui: Fix issue where some elements would fail to work properly if using ACLs\n   with segment-wildcard paths (`/+/` segments) [[GH-6525](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6525)]\n\n## 1.1.0 (March 18th, 2019)\n\nCHANGES:\n\n* auth/jwt: The `groups_claim_delimiter_pattern` field has been removed.

To configure new JWT roles, a role type of \"jwt\" must be explicitly\n   specified.\n* cli: CLI commands deprecated in 0.9.2 are now removed. Please see the CLI\n   help/warning output in previous versions of Vault for updated commands.\n* core: Vault no longer automatically mounts a K/V backend at the \"secret/\"\n   path when initializing Vault\n* core: Vault's cluster port will now be open at all times on HA standby nodes\n* plugins: Vault no longer supports running netRPC plugins. These were\n   deprecated in favor of gRPC based plugins and any plugin built since 0.9.4\n   defaults to gRPC. Older plugins may need to be recompiled against the latest\n   Vault dependencies.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* **Vault Agent Caching**: Vault Agent can now be configured to act as a\n   caching proxy to Vault. Clients can send requests to Vault Agent and the\n   request will be proxied to the Vault server and cached locally in Agent.\n   Currently Agent will cache generated leases and tokens and keep them\n   renewed. The proxy can also use the Auto Auth feature so clients do not need\n   to authenticate to Vault, but rather can make requests to Agent and have\n   Agent fully manage token lifecycle.\n* **OIDC Redirect Flow Support**: The JWT auth backend now supports OIDC\n   roles. These allow authentication via an OIDC-compliant provider via the\n   user's browser. The login may be initiated from the Vault UI or through\n   the `vault login` command.\n* **ACL Path Wildcard**: ACL paths can now use the `+` character to enable\n   wild card matching for a single directory in the path definition.\n* **Transit Auto Unseal**: Vault can now be configured to use the Transit\n   Secret Engine in another Vault cluster as an auto unseal provider.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* auth/jwt: A default role can be set.

This data was not accessible to users via Vault's API but via a\n   combination of privileged configuration file changes/Vault commands it could\n   be read.  Upgrading to this version or 1.1 will fix this issue and cause the\n   replicated data to be deleted from filtered secondaries. More information\n   was sent to customer contacts on file.\n\n## 1.0.3 (February 12th, 2019)\n\nCHANGES:\n\n* New AWS authentication plugin mounts will default to using the generated\n   role ID as the Identity alias name. This applies to both EC2 and IAM auth.\n   Existing mounts that explicitly set this value will not be affected but\n   mounts that specified no preference will switch over on upgrade.\n* The default policy now allows a token to look up its associated identity\n   entity either by name or by id [[GH-6105](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6105)]\n* The Vault UI's navigation and onboarding wizard now only displays items that\n   are permitted in a users' policy [[GH-5980](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5980), [GH-6094](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/6094)]\n* An issue was fixed that caused recovery keys to not work on secondary\n   clusters when using a different unseal mechanism/key than the primary. This\n   would be hit if the cluster was rekeyed or initialized after 1.0. We recommend\n   rekeying the recovery keys on the primary cluster if you meet the above\n   requirements.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* **cURL Command Output**: CLI commands can now use the `-output-curl-string`\n   flag to print out an equivalent cURL command.\n* **Response Headers From Plugins**: Plugins can now send back headers that\n   will be included in the response to a client.

For this to happen, the data would need to be\n   modified by the autoseal mechanism after being submitted to it by Vault but\n   prior to encryption, or after decryption, prior to it being returned to\n   Vault. To put it another way, it requires the data that Vault submits for\n   encryption to not match the data returned after decryption. It is not\n   sufficient for the autoseal mechanism to return an error, and it cannot be\n   triggered by an outside attacker changing the on-disk ciphertext as all\n   autoseal mechanisms use authenticated encryption. We do not believe that\n   this is generally a cause for concern; since it involves the autoseal\n   mechanism returning bad data to Vault but with no error, in a working Vault\n   configuration this code path should never be hit, and if hitting this issue\n   Vault will not be unsealing properly anyways so it will be obvious what is\n   happening and an immediate rekey of the master key can be performed after\n   service is restored. We have filed for a CVE (CVE-2018-19786) and a CVSS V3\n   score of 5.2 has been assigned.\n\nCHANGES:\n\n* Tokens are now prefixed by a designation to indicate what type of token they\n   are. Service tokens start with `s.` and batch tokens start with `b.`.\n   Existing tokens will still work (they are all of service type and will be\n   considered as such). Prefixing allows us to be more efficient when consuming\n   a token, which keeps the critical path of requests faster.\n* Paths within `auth/token` that allow specifying a token or accessor in the\n   URL have been removed. These have been deprecated since March 2016 and\n   undocumented, but were retained for backwards compatibility. They shouldn't\n   be used due to the possibility of those paths being logged, so at this point\n   they are simply being removed.\n* Vault will no longer accept updates when the storage key has invalid UTF-8\n   character encoding [[GH-5819](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5819)]\n* Mount/Auth tuning the `options` map on backends will now upsert any provided\n   values, and keep any of the existing values in place if not provided. The\n   options map itself cannot be unset once it's set, but the keypairs within the\n   map can be unset if an empty value is provided, with the exception of the\n   `version` keypair which is handled differently for KVv2 purposes.\n* Agent no longer automatically reauthenticates when new credentials are\n   detected. It's not strictly necessary and in some cases was causing\n   reauthentication much more often than intended.\n* HSM Regenerate Key Support Removed: Vault no longer supports destroying and\n   regenerating encryption keys on an HSM; it only supports creating them.\n   Although this has never been a source of a customer incident, it is simply a\n   code path that is too trivial to activate, especially by mistyping\n   `regenerate_key` instead of `generate_key`.\n* Barrier Config Upgrade (Enterprise): When upgrading from Vault 0.8.x, the\n   seal type in the barrier config storage entry will be upgraded from\n   \"hsm-auto\" to \"awskms\" or \"pkcs11\" upon unseal if using AWSKMS or HSM seals.\n   If performing seal migration, the barrier config should first be upgraded\n   prior to starting migration.\n* Go API client uses pooled HTTP client: The Go API client now uses a\n   connection-pooling HTTP client by default. For CLI operations this makes no\n   difference but it should provide significant performance benefits for those\n   writing custom clients using the Go API library. As before, this can be\n   changed to any custom HTTP client by the caller.\n* Builtin Secret Engines and Auth Methods are integrated deeper into the\n   plugin system. The plugin catalog can now override builtin plugins with\n   custom versions of the same name. Additionally the plugin system now\n   requires a plugin `type` field when configuring plugins, this can be \"auth\",\n   \"database\", or \"secret\".\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* **Auto-Unseal in Open Source**: Cloud-based auto-unseal has been migrated\n   from Enterprise to Open Source. We've created a migrator to allow migrating\n   between Shamir seals and auto unseal methods.\n* **Batch Tokens**: Batch tokens trade off some features of service tokens for no\n   storage overhead, and in most cases can be used across performance\n   replication clusters.\n* **Replication Speed Improvements**: We've worked hard to speed up a lot of\n   operations when using Vault Enterprise Replication.\n* **GCP KMS Secrets Engine**: This new secrets engine provides a Transit-like\n   pattern to keys stored within GCP Cloud KMS.\n* **AppRole support in Vault Agent Auto-Auth**: You can now use AppRole\n   credentials when having Agent automatically authenticate to Vault\n* **OpenAPI Support**: Descriptions of mounted backends can be served directly\n   from Vault\n* **Kubernetes Projected Service Account Tokens**: Projected Service Account\n   Tokens are now supported in Kubernetes auth\n* **Response Wrapping in UI**: Added ability to wrap secrets and easily copy\n   the wrap token or secret JSON in the UI\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* agent: Support for configuring the location of the kubernetes service account\n   [[GH-5725](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5725)]\n* auth/token: New tokens are indexed in storage HMAC-SHA256 instead of SHA1\n* secret/totp: Allow @ character to be part of key name [[GH-5652](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5652)]\n* secret/consul: Add support for new policy based tokens added in Consul 1.4\n   [[GH-5586](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5586)]\n* ui: Improve the token auto-renew warning, and automatically begin renewal\n   when a user becomes active again [[GH-5662](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5662)]\n* ui: The unbundled UI page now has some styling [[GH-5665](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5665)]\n* ui: Improved banner and popup design [[GH-5672](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5672)]\n* ui: Added token type to auth method mount config [[GH-5723](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5723)]\n* ui: Display additonal wrap info when unwrapping.

`varbinary` instead of `varchar` when creating HA tables\n   [[GH-5529](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5529)]\n\n## 0.11.3 (October 8th, 2018)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n * Revocation: A regression in 0.11.2 (OSS) and 0.11.0 (Enterprise) caused\n   lease IDs containing periods (`.`) to not be revoked properly. Upon startup\n   when revocation is tried again these should now revoke successfully.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/ldap: Listing of users and groups return absolute paths [[GH-5537](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5537)]\n * secret/pki: OID SANs can now specify `*` to allow any value [[GH-5459](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5459)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * auth/ldap: Fix panic if specific values were given to be escaped [[GH-5471](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5471)]\n * cli/auth: Fix panic if `vault auth` was given no parameters [[GH-5473](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5473)]\n * secret/database/mongodb: Fix panic that could occur at high load [[GH-5463](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5463)]\n * secret/pki: Fix CA generation not allowing OID SANs [[GH-5459](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5459)]\n\n## 0.11.2 (October 2nd, 2018)\n\nCHANGES:\n\n * `sys/seal-status` now includes an `initialized` boolean in the output. If\n   Vault is not initialized, it will return a `200` with this value set `false`\n   instead of a `400`.\n * `passthrough_request_headers` will now deny certain headers from being\n   provided to backends based on a global denylist.\n * Token Format: Tokens are now represented as a base62 value; tokens in\n   namespaces will have the namespace identifier appended. (This appeared in\n   Enterprise in 0.11.0, but is only in OSS in 0.11.2.)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **AWS Secret Engine Root Credential Rotation**: The credential used by the AWS\n   secret engine can now be rotated, to ensure that only Vault knows the\n   credentials it is using [[GH-5140](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5140)]\n * **Storage Backend Migrator**: A new `operator migrate` command allows offline\n   migration of data between two storage backends\n * **AliCloud KMS Auto Unseal and Seal Wrap Support (Enterprise)**: AliCloud KMS can now be used a support seal for\n   Auto Unseal and Seal Wrapping\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * auth/okta: Fix reading deprecated `token` parameter if a token was\n   previously set in the configuration [[GH-5409](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5409)]\n * core: Re-add deprecated capabilities information for now [[GH-5360](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5360)]\n * core: Fix handling of cyclic token relationships [[GH-4803](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4803)]\n * storage/mysql: Fix locking on MariaDB [[GH-5343](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5343)]\n * replication: Fix DR API when using a token [[GH-5398](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5398)]\n * identity: Ensure old group alias is removed when a new one is written [[GH-5350](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5350)]\n * storage/alicloud: Don't call uname on package init [[GH-5358](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5358)]\n * secrets/jwt: Fix issue where request context would be canceled too early\n * ui: fix need to have update for aws iam creds generation [GF-5294]\n * ui: fix calculation of token expiry [[GH-5435](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5435)]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/aws: The identity alias name can now configured to be either IAM unique\n   ID of the IAM Principal, or ARN of the caller identity [[GH-5247](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5247)]\n * auth/cert: Add allowed_organizational_units support [[GH-5252](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5252)]\n * cli: Format TTLs for non-secret responses [[GH-5367](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5367)]\n * identity: Support operating on entities and groups by their names [[GH-5355](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5355)]\n * plugins: Add `env` parameter when registering plugins to the catalog to allow\n   operators to include environment variables during plugin execution. [[GH-5359](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5359)]\n * secrets/aws: WAL Rollback improvements [[GH-5202](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5202)]\n * secrets/aws: Allow specifying STS role-default TTLs [[GH-5138](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5138)]\n * secrets/pki: Add configuration support for setting NotBefore [[GH-5325](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5325)]\n * core: Support for passing the Vault token via an Authorization Bearer header [[GH-5397](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5397)]\n * replication: Reindex process now runs in the background and does not block other\n   vault operations\n * storage/zookeeper: Enable TLS based communication with Zookeeper [[GH-4856](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4856)]\n * ui: you can now init a cluster with a seal config [[GH-5428](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5428)]\n * ui: added the option to force promote replication clusters [[GH-5438](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5438)]\n * replication: Allow promotion of a secondary when data is syncing with a \"force\" flag\n\n## 0.11.1.1 (September 17th, 2018) (Enterprise Only)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * agent: Fix auth handler-based wrapping of output tokens [[GH-5316](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5316)]\n * core: Properly store the replication checkpoint file if it's larger than the\n   storage engine's per-item limit\n * core: Improve WAL deletion rate\n * core: Fix token creation on performance standby nodes\n * core: Fix unwrapping inside a namespace\n * core: Always forward tidy operations from performance standby nodes\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/aws: add support for key/value pairs or JSON values for\n   `iam_request_headers` with IAM auth method [[GH-5320](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5320)]\n * auth/aws, secret/aws: Throttling errors from the AWS API will now be\n   reported as 502 errors by Vault, along with the original error [[GH-5270](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5270)]\n * replication: Start fetching during a sync from where it previously errored\n\n## 0.11.1 (September 6th, 2018)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n * Random Byte Reading in Barrier: Prior to this release, Vault was not\n   properly checking the error code when reading random bytes for the IV for\n   AES operations in its cryptographic barrier. Specifically, this means that\n   such an IV could potentially be zero multiple times, causing nonce re-use\n   and weakening the security of the key. On most platforms this should never\n   happen because reading from kernel random sources is non-blocking and always\n   successful, but there may be platform-specific behavior that has not been\n   accounted for. (Vault has tests to check exactly this, and the tests have\n   never seen nonce re-use.)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * AliCloud Agent Support: Vault Agent can now authenticate against the\n   AliCloud auth method.\n * UI: Enable AliCloud auth method and Azure secrets engine via the UI.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * core: Logging level for most logs (not including secrets/auth plugins) can\n   now be changed on-the-fly via `SIGHUP`, reading the desired value from\n   Vault's config file [[GH-5280](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5280)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * core: Ensure we use a background context when stepping down [[GH-5290](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5290)]\n * core: Properly check error return from random byte reading [[GH-5277](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5277)]\n * core: Re-add `sys/` top-route injection for now [[GH-5241](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5241)]\n * core: Policies stored in minified JSON would return an error [[GH-5229](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5229)]\n * core: Evaluate templated policies in capabilities check [[GH-5250](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5250)]\n * identity: Update MemDB with identity group alias while loading groups [[GH-5289](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5289)]\n * secrets/database: Fix nil pointer when revoking some leases [[GH-5262](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5262)]\n * secrets/pki: Fix sign-verbatim losing extra Subject attributes [[GH-5245](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5245)]\n * secrets/pki: Remove certificates from store when tidying revoked\n   certificates and simplify API [[GH-5231](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5231)]\n * ui: JSON editor will not coerce input to an object, and will now show an\n   error about Vault expecting an object [[GH-5271](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5271)]\n * ui: authentication form will now default to any methods that have been tuned\n   to show up for unauthenticated users [[GH-5281](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5281)]\n\n\n## 0.11.0 (August 28th, 2018)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * Request Timeouts: A default request timeout of 90s is now enforced. This\n   setting can be overwritten in the config file. If you anticipate requests\n   taking longer than 90s this setting should be updated before upgrading.\n * (NOTE: will be re-added into 0.11.1 as it broke more than anticipated. There\n   will be some further guidelines around when this will be removed again.)\n   * `sys/` Top Level Injection: For the last two years for backwards\n   compatibility data for various `sys/` routes has been injected into both the\n   Secret's Data map and into the top level of the JSON response object.\n   However, this has some subtle issues that pop up from time to time and is\n   becoming increasingly complicated to maintain, so it's finally being\n   removed.\n * Path Fallback for List Operations: For a very long time Vault has\n   automatically adjusted `list` operations to always end in a `/`, as list\n   operations operates on prefixes, so all list operations by definition end\n   with `/`. This was done server-side so affects all clients. However, this\n   has also led to a lot of confusion for users writing policies that assume\n   that the path that they use in the CLI is the path used internally. Starting\n   in 0.11, ACL policies gain a new fallback rule for listing: they will use a\n   matching path ending in `/` if available, but if not found, they will look\n   for the same path without a trailing `/`. This allows putting `list`\n   capabilities in the same path block as most other capabilities for that\n   path, while not providing any extra access if `list` wasn't actually\n   provided there.\n * Performance Standbys On By Default: If you flavor/license of Vault\n   Enterprise supports Performance Standbys, they are on by default. You can\n   disable this behavior per-node with the `disable_performance_standby`\n   configuration flag.\n * AWS Secret Engine Roles: The AWS Secret Engine roles are now explicit about\n   the type of AWS credential they are generating; this reduces reduce\n   ambiguity that existed previously as well as enables new features for\n   specific credential types. Writing role data and generating credentials\n   remain backwards compatible; however, the data returned when reading a\n   role's configuration has changed in backwards-incompatible ways. Anything\n   that depended on reading role data from the AWS secret engine will break\n   until it is updated to work with the new format.\n * Token Format (Enterprise): Tokens are now represented as a base62 value;\n   tokens in namespaces will have the namespace identifier appended.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Namespaces (Enterprise)**: A set of features within Vault Enterprise\n   that allows Vault environments to support *Secure Multi-tenancy* within a\n   single Vault Enterprise infrastructure. Through namespaces, Vault\n   administrators can support tenant isolation for teams and individuals as\n   well as empower those individuals to self-manage their own tenant\n   environment.\n * **Performance Standbys (Enterprise)**: Standby nodes can now service\n   requests that do not modify storage. This provides near-horizontal scaling\n   of a cluster in some workloads, and is the intra-cluster analogue of\n   the existing Performance Replication feature, which replicates to distinct\n   clusters in other datacenters, geos, etc.\n * **AliCloud OSS Storage**: AliCloud OSS can now be used for Vault storage.\n * **AliCloud Auth Plugin**: AliCloud's identity services can now be used to\n   grant access to Vault. See the [plugin\n   repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-alicloud) for\n   more information.\n * **Azure Secrets Plugin**: There is now a plugin (pulled in to Vault) that\n   allows generating credentials to allow access to Azure. See the [plugin\n   repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-azure) for\n   more information.\n * **HA Support for MySQL Storage**: MySQL storage now supports HA.\n * **ACL Templating**: ACL policies can now be templated using identity Entity,\n   Groups, and Metadata.\n * **UI Onboarding wizards**: The Vault UI can provide contextual help and\n   guidance, linking out to relevant links or guides on vaultproject.io for\n   various workflows in Vault.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * agent: Add `exit_after_auth` to be able to use the Agent for a single\n   authentication [[GH-5013](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5013)]\n * auth/approle: Add ability to set token bound CIDRs on individual Secret IDs\n   [[GH-5034](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5034)]\n * cli: Add support for passing parameters to `vault read` operations [[GH-5093](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5093)]\n * secrets/aws: Make credential types more explicit [[GH-4360](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4360)]\n * secrets/nomad: Support for longer token names [[GH-5117](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5117)]\n * secrets/pki: Allow disabling CRL generation [[GH-5134](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5134)]\n * storage/azure: Add support for different Azure environments [[GH-4997](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4997)]\n * storage/file: Sort keys in list responses [[GH-5141](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5141)]\n * storage/mysql: Support special characters in database and table names.\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * auth/jwt: Always validate `aud` claim even if `bound_audiences` isn't set\n   (IOW, error in this case)\n * core: Prevent Go's HTTP library from interspersing logs in a different\n   format and/or interleaved [[GH-5135](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5135)]\n * identity: Properly populate `mount_path` and `mount_type` on group lookup\n   [[GH-5074](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5074)]\n * identity: Fix persisting alias metadata [[GH-5188](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5188)]\n * identity: Fix carryover issue from previously fixed race condition that\n   could cause Vault not to start up due to two entities referencing the same\n   alias. These entities are now merged. [[GH-5000](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5000)]\n * replication: Fix issue causing some pages not to flush to storage\n * secrets/database: Fix inability to update custom SQL statements on\n   database roles. [[GH-5080](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5080)]\n * secrets/pki: Disallow putting the CA's serial on its CRL. While technically\n   legal, doing so inherently means the CRL can't be trusted anyways, so it's\n   not useful and easy to footgun. [[GH-5134](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5134)]\n * storage/gcp,spanner: Fix data races [[GH-5081](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/5081)]\n\n## 0.10.4 (July 25th, 2018)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n * Control Groups: The associated Identity entity with a request was not being\n   properly persisted. As a result, the same authorizer could provide more than\n   one authorization.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * Revocations of dynamic secrets leases are now queued/asynchronous rather\n   than synchronous. This allows Vault to take responsibility for revocation\n   even if the initial attempt fails. The previous synchronous behavior can be\n   attained via the `-sync` CLI flag or `sync` API parameter. When in\n   synchronous mode, if the operation results in failure it is up to the user\n   to retry.\n * CLI Retries: The CLI will no longer retry commands on 5xx errors. This was a\n   source of confusion to users as to why Vault would \"hang\" before returning a\n   5xx error. The Go API client still defaults to two retries.\n * Identity Entity Alias metadata: You can no longer manually set metadata on\n   entity aliases. All alias data (except the canonical entity ID it refers to)\n   is intended to be managed by the plugin providing the alias information, so\n   allowing it to be set manually didn't make sense.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **JWT/OIDC Auth Method**: The new `jwt` auth method accepts JWTs and either\n   validates signatures locally or uses OIDC Discovery to fetch the current set\n   of keys for signature validation. Various claims can be specified for\n   validation (in addition to the cryptographic signature) and a user and\n   optional groups claim can be used to provide Identity information.\n * **FoundationDB Storage**: You can now use FoundationDB for storing Vault\n   data.\n * **UI Control Group Workflow (enterprise)**: The UI will now detect control\n   group responses and provides a workflow to view the status of the request\n   and to authorize requests.\n * **Vault Agent (Beta)**: Vault Agent is a daemon that can automatically\n   authenticate for you across a variety of authentication methods, provide\n   tokens to clients, and keep the tokens renewed, reauthenticating as\n   necessary.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/azure: Add support for virtual machine scale sets\n * auth/gcp: Support multiple bindings for region, zone, and instance group\n * cli: Add subcommands for interacting with the plugin catalog [[GH-4911](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4911)]\n * cli: Add a `-description` flag to secrets and auth tune subcommands to allow\n   updating an existing secret engine's or auth method's description. This\n   change also allows the description to be unset by providing an empty string.\n * core: Add config flag to disable non-printable character check [[GH-4917](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4917)]\n * core: A `max_request_size` parameter can now be set per-listener to adjust\n   the maximum allowed size per request

[[GH-4977](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4977)]\n\n## 0.10.3 (June 20th, 2018)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * In the audit log and in client responses, policies are now split into three\n   parameters: policies that came only from tokens, policies that came only\n   from Identity, and the combined set. Any previous location of policies via\n   the API now contains the full, combined set.\n * When a token is tied to an Identity entity and the entity is deleted, the\n   token will no longer be usable, regardless of the validity of the token\n   itself.\n * When authentication succeeds but no policies were defined for that specific\n   user, most auth methods would allow a token to be generated but a few would\n   reject the authentication, namely `ldap`, `okta`, and `radius`. Since the\n   `default` policy is added by Vault's core, this would incorrectly reject\n   valid authentications before they would in fact be granted policies. This\n   inconsistency has been addressed; valid authentications for these methods\n   now succeed even if no policy was specifically defined in that method for\n   that user.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * Root Rotation for Active Directory: You can now command Vault to rotate the\n   configured root credentials used in the AD secrets engine, to ensure that\n   only Vault knows the credentials it's using.\n * URI SANs in PKI: You can now configure URI Subject Alternate Names in the\n   `pki` backend. Roles can limit which SANs are allowed via globbing.\n * `kv rollback` Command: You can now use `vault kv rollback` to roll a KVv2\n   path back to a previous non-deleted/non-destroyed version. The previous\n   version becomes the next/newest version for the path.\n * Token Bound CIDRs in AppRole: You can now add CIDRs to which a token\n   generated from AppRole will be bound.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * approle: Return 404 instead of 202 on invalid role names during POST\n   operations [[GH-4778](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4778)]\n * core: Add idle and initial header read/TLS handshake timeouts to connections\n   to ensure server resources are cleaned up [[GH-4760](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4760)]\n * core: Report policies in token, identity, and full sets [[GH-4747](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4747)]\n * secrets/databases: Add `create`/`update` distinction for connection\n   configurations [[GH-3544](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3544)]\n * secrets/databases: Add `create`/`update` distinction for role configurations\n   [[GH-3544](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3544)]\n * secrets/databases: Add best-effort revocation logic for use when a role has\n   been deleted [[GH-4782](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4782)]\n * secrets/kv: Add `kv rollback` [[GH-4774](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4774)]\n * secrets/pki: Add URI SANs support [[GH-4675](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4675)]\n * secrets/ssh: Allow standard SSH command arguments to be used, without\n   requiring username@hostname syntax [[GH-4710](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4710)]\n * storage/consul: Add context support so that requests are cancelable\n   [[GH-4739](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4739)]\n * sys: Added `hidden` option to `listing_visibility` field on `sys/mounts`\n   API [[GH-4827](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4827)]\n * ui: Secret values are obfuscated by default and visibility is toggleable [[GH-4422](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4422)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * auth/approle: Fix panic due to metadata being nil [[GH-4719](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4719)]\n * auth/aws: Fix delete path for tidy operations [[GH-4799](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4799)]\n * core: Optimizations to remove some speed regressions due to the\n   security-related changes in 0.10.2\n * storage/dynamodb: Fix errors seen when reading existing DynamoDB data [[GH-4721](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4721)]\n * secrets/database: Fix default MySQL root rotation statement [[GH-4748](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4748)]\n * secrets/gcp: Fix renewal for GCP account keys\n * secrets/kv: Fix writing to the root of a KVv2 mount from `vault kv` commands\n   incorrectly operating on a root+mount path instead of being an error\n   [[GH-4726](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4726)]\n * seal/pkcs11: Add `CKK_SHA256_HMAC` to the search list when finding HMAC\n   keys, fixing lookup on some Thales devices\n * replication: Fix issue enabling replication when a non-auth mount and auth\n   mount have the same name\n * auth/kubernetes: Fix issue verifying ECDSA signed JWTs\n * ui: add missing edit mode for auth method configs [[GH-4770](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4770)]\n\n## 0.10.2 (June 6th, 2018)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n * Tokens: A race condition was identified that could occur if a token's\n   lease expired while Vault was not running. In this case, when Vault came\n   back online, sometimes it would properly revoke the lease but other times it\n   would not, leading to a Vault token that no longer had an expiration and had\n   essentially unlimited lifetime. This race was per-token, not all-or-nothing\n   for all tokens that may have expired during Vault's downtime. We have fixed\n   the behavior and put extra checks in place to help prevent any similar\n   future issues. In addition, the logic we have put in place ensures that such\n   lease-less tokens can no longer be used (unless they are root tokens that\n   never had an expiration to begin with).\n * Convergent Encryption: The version 2 algorithm used in `transit`'s\n   convergent encryption feature is susceptible to offline\n   plaintext-confirmation attacks. As a result, we are introducing a version 3\n   algorithm that mitigates this. If you are currently using convergent\n   encryption, we recommend upgrading, rotating your encryption key (the new\n   key version will use the new algorithm), and rewrapping your data (the\n   `rewrap` endpoint can be used to allow a relatively non-privileged user to\n   perform the rewrapping while never divulging the plaintext).\n * AppRole case-sensitive role name secret-id leaking: When using a mixed-case\n   role name via AppRole, deleting a secret-id via accessor or other operations\n   could end up leaving the secret-id behind and valid but without an accessor.\n   This has now been fixed, and we have put checks in place to prevent these\n   secret-ids from being used.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * PKI duration return types: The PKI backend now returns durations (e.g. when\n   reading a role) as an integer number of seconds instead of a Go-style\n   string, in line with how the rest of Vault's API returns durations.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * Active Directory Secrets Engine: A new `ad` secrets engine has been created\n   which allows Vault to rotate and provide credentials for configured AD\n   accounts.\n * Rekey Verification: Rekey operations can now require verification. This\n   turns on a two-phase process where the existing key shares authorize\n   generating a new master key, and a threshold of the new, returned key shares\n   must be provided to verify that they have been successfully received in\n   order for the actual master key to be rotated.\n * CIDR restrictions for `cert`, `userpass`, and `kubernetes` auth methods:\n   You can now limit authentication to specific CIDRs; these will also be\n   encoded in resultant tokens to limit their use.\n * Vault UI Browser CLI: The UI now supports usage of read/write/list/delete\n   commands in a CLI that can be accessed from the nav bar. Complex inputs such\n   as JSON files are not currently supported. This surfaces features otherwise\n   unsupported in Vault's UI.\n * Azure Key Vault Auto Unseal/Seal Wrap Support (Enterprise): Azure Key Vault\n   can now be used a support seal for Auto Unseal and Seal Wrapping.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * api: Close renewer's doneCh when the renewer is stopped, so that programs\n   expecting a final value through doneCh behave correctly

core/pkcs11 (enterprise): Add support for CKM_AES_CBC_PAD, CKM_RSA_PKCS, and\n   CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP mechanisms\n * core/pkcs11 (enterprise): HSM slots can now be selected by token label\n   instead of

They only affect\nEnterprise, and as such 0.9.7 is an Enterprise-only release:\n\nSECURITY:\n\n * EGPs: A regression affecting 0.9.6 and 0.10.0 causes EGPs to not be applied\n   correctly if an EGP is updated in a running Vault after initial write or\n   after it is loaded on unseal. This has been fixed.\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * Fixed an upgrade issue affecting performance secondaries when migrating from\n   a version that did not include Identity to one that did.\n\nAll other content in this release is for 0.10.1 only.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * `vault kv` and Vault versions: In 0.10.1 some issues with `vault kv` against\n   v1 K/V engine mounts are fixed. However, using 0.10.1 for both the server\n   and CLI versions is required.\n * Mount information visibility: Users that have access to any path within a\n   mount can now see information about that mount, such as its type and\n   options, via some API calls.\n * Identity and Local Mounts: Local mounts would allow creating Identity\n   entities but these would not be able to be used successfully (even locally)\n   in replicated scenarios. We have now disallowed entities and groups from\n   being created for local mounts in the first place.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * X-Forwarded-For support: `X-Forwarded-For` headers can now be used to set the\n   client IP seen by Vault. See the [TCP listener configuration\n   page](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/listener/tcp.html) for\n   details.\n * CIDR IP Binding for Tokens: Tokens now support being bound to specific\n   CIDR(s) for usage. Currently this is implemented in Token Roles; usage can be\n   expanded to other authentication backends over time.\n * `vault kv patch` command: A new `kv patch` helper command that allows\n   modifying only some values in existing data at a K/V path, but uses\n   check-and-set to ensure that this modification happens safely.\n * AppRole Local Secret IDs: Roles can now be configured to generate secret IDs\n   local to the cluster. This enables performance secondaries to generate and\n   consume secret IDs without contacting the primary.\n * AES-GCM Support for PKCS#11 [BETA] (Enterprise): For supporting HSMs,\n   AES-GCM can now be used in lieu of AES-CBC/HMAC-SHA256. This has currently\n   only been fully tested on AWS CloudHSM.\n * Auto Unseal/Seal Wrap Key Rotation Support (Enterprise): Auto Unseal\n   mechanisms, including PKCS#11 HSMs, now support rotation of encryption keys,\n   and migration between key and encryption types, such as from AES-CBC to\n   AES-GCM, can be performed at the same time (where supported).\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/approle: Support for cluster local secret IDs.

This should fix needing \"update\" capabilites to read IAM\n   credentials in the AWS secrets engine [[GH-4446](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/4446)]\n\n## 0.10.0 (April 10th, 2018)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n * Log sanitization for Combined Database Secret Engine: In certain failure\n   scenarios with incorrectly formatted connection urls, the raw connection\n   errors were being returned to the user with the configured database\n   credentials. Errors are now sanitized before being returned to the user.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * Database plugin compatibility: The database plugin interface was enhanced to\n   support some additional functionality related to root credential rotation\n   and supporting templated URL strings. The changes were made in a\n   backwards-compatible way and all builtin plugins were updated with the new\n   features. Custom plugins not built into Vault will need to be upgraded to\n   support templated URL strings and root rotation. Additionally, the\n   Initialize method was deprecated in favor of a new Init method that supports\n   configuration modifications that occur in the plugin back to the primary\n   data store.\n * Removal of returned secret information: For a long time Vault has returned\n   configuration given to various secret engines and auth methods with secret\n   values (such as secret API keys or passwords) still intact, and with a\n   warning to the user on write that anyone with read access could see the\n   secret. This was mostly done to make it easy for tools like Terraform to\n   judge whether state had drifted. However, it also feels quite un-Vault-y to\n   do this and we've never felt very comfortable doing so. In 0.10 we have gone\n   through and removed this behavior from the various backends; fields which\n   contained secret values are simply no longer returned on read. We are\n   working with the Terraform team to make changes to their provider to\n   accommodate this as best as possible, and users of other tools may have to\n   make adjustments, but in the end we felt that the ends did not justify the\n   means and we needed to prioritize security over operational convenience.\n * LDAP auth method case sensitivity: We now treat usernames and groups\n   configured locally for policy assignment in a case insensitive fashion by\n   default. Existing configurations will continue to work as they do now;\n   however, the next time a configuration is written `case_sensitive_names`\n   will need to be explicitly set to `true`.\n * TTL handling within core: All lease TTL handling has been centralized within\n   the core of Vault to ensure consistency across all backends. Since this was\n   previously delegated to individual backends, there may be some slight\n   differences in TTLs generated from some backends.\n * Removal of default `secret/` mount: In 0.12 we will stop mounting `secret/`\n   by default at initialization time (it will still be available in `dev`\n   mode).\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * OSS UI: The Vault UI is now fully open-source. Similarly to the CLI, some\n   features are only available with a supporting version of Vault, but the code\n   base is entirely open.\n * Versioned K/V: The `kv` backend has been completely revamped, featuring\n   flexible versioning of values, check-and-set protections, and more. A new\n   `vault kv` subcommand allows friendly interactions with it. Existing mounts\n   of the `kv` backend can be upgraded to the new versioned mode (downgrades\n   are not currently supported). The old \"passthrough\" mode is still the\n   default for new mounts; versioning can be turned on by setting the\n   `-version=2` flag for the `vault secrets enable` command.\n * Database Root Credential Rotation: Database configurations can now rotate\n   their own configured admin/root credentials, allowing configured credentials\n   for a database connection to be rotated immediately after sending them into\n   Vault, invalidating the old credentials and ensuring only Vault knows the\n   actual valid values.\n * Azure Authentication Plugin: There is now a plugin (pulled in to Vault) that\n   allows authenticating Azure machines to Vault using Azure's Managed Service\n   Identity credentials. See the [plugin\n   repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-azure) for more\n   information.\n * GCP Secrets Plugin: There is now a plugin (pulled in to Vault) that allows\n   generating secrets to allow access to GCP. See the [plugin\n   repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp) for more\n   information.\n * Selective Audit HMACing of Request and Response Data Keys: HMACing in audit\n   logs can be turned off for specific keys in the request input map and\n   response `data` map on a per-mount basis.\n * Passthrough Request Headers: Request headers can now be selectively passed\n   through to backends on a per-mount basis.

However, to keep consistency with\n   input and output, when reading a role the binds will now be returned as\n   string arrays rather than strings.\n * In order to prefix-match IAM role and instance profile ARNs in AWS auth\n   backend, you now must explicitly opt-in by adding a `*` to the end of the\n   ARN. Existing configurations will be upgraded automatically, but when\n   writing a new role configuration the updated behavior will be used.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * Replication Activation Enhancements: When activating a replication\n   secondary, a public key can now be fetched first from the target cluster.\n   This public key can be provided to the primary when requesting the\n   activation token. If provided, the public key will be used to perform a\n   Diffie-Hellman key exchange resulting in a shared key that encrypts the\n   contents of the activation token. The purpose is to protect against\n   accidental disclosure of the contents of the token if unwrapped by the wrong\n   party, given that the contents of the token are highly sensitive. If\n   accidentally unwrapped, the contents of the token are not usable by the\n   unwrapping party. It is important to note that just as a malicious operator\n   could unwrap the contents of the token, a malicious operator can pretend to\n   be a secondary and complete the Diffie-Hellman exchange on their own; this\n   feature provides defense in depth but still requires due diligence around\n   replication activation, including multiple eyes on the commands/tokens and\n   proper auditing.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * api: Update renewer grace period logic.

Only accounts in SUCCESS or PASSWORD_WARN states are now allowed.\n * Periodic Tokens: A regression in 0.9.1 meant that periodic tokens created by\n   the AppRole, AWS, and Cert auth backends would expire when the max TTL for\n   the backend/mount/system was hit instead of their stated behavior of living\n   as long as they are renewed. This is now fixed; existing tokens do not have\n   to be reissued as this was purely a regression in the renewal logic.\n * Seal Wrapping: During certain replication states values written marked for\n   seal wrapping may not be wrapped on the secondaries. This has been fixed,\n   and existing values will be wrapped on next read or write. This does not\n   affect the barrier keys.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * `sys/health` DR Secondary Reporting: The `replication_dr_secondary` bool\n   returned by `sys/health` could be misleading since it would be `false` both\n   when a cluster was not a DR secondary but also when the node is a standby in\n   the cluster and has not yet fully received state from the active node. This\n   could cause health checks on LBs to decide that the node was acceptable for\n   traffic even though DR secondaries cannot handle normal Vault traffic. (In\n   other words, the bool could only convey \"yes\" or \"no\" but not \"not sure\n   yet\".) This has been replaced by `replication_dr_mode` and\n   `replication_perf_mode` which are string values that convey the current\n   state of the node; a value of `disabled` indicates that replication is\n   disabled or the state is still being discovered. As a result, an LB check\n   can positively verify that the node is both not `disabled` and is not a DR\n   secondary, and avoid sending traffic to it if either is true.\n * PKI Secret Backend Roles parameter types: For `ou` and `organization`\n   in role definitions in the PKI secret backend, input can now be a\n   comma-separated string or an array of strings. Reading a role will\n   now return arrays for these parameters.\n * Plugin API Changes: The plugin API has been updated to utilize golang's\n   context.Context package. Many function signatures now accept a context\n   object as the first parameter. Existing plugins will need to pull in the\n   latest Vault code and update their function signatures to begin using\n   context and the new gRPC transport.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **gRPC Backend Plugins**: Backend plugins now use gRPC for transport,\n   allowing them to be written in other languages.\n * **Brand New CLI**: Vault has a brand new CLI interface that is significantly\n   streamlined, supports autocomplete, and is almost entirely backwards\n   compatible.\n * **UI: PKI Secret Backend (Enterprise)**: Configure PKI secret backends,\n   create and browse roles and certificates, and issue and sign certificates via\n   the listed roles.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/aws: Handle IAM headers produced by clients that formulate numbers as\n   ints rather than strings [[GH-3763](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3763)]\n * auth/okta: Support JSON lists when specifying groups and policies [[GH-3801](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3801)]\n * autoseal/hsm: Attempt reconnecting to the HSM on certain kinds of issues,\n   including HA scenarios for some Gemalto HSMs.\n   (Enterprise)\n * cli: Output password prompts to stderr to make it easier to pipe an output\n   token to another command [[GH-3782](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3782)]\n * core: Report replication status in `sys/health` [[GH-3810](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3810)]\n * physical/s3: Allow using paths with S3 for non-AWS deployments [[GH-3730](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3730)]\n * physical/s3: Add ability to disable SSL for non-AWS deployments [[GH-3730](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3730)]\n * plugins: Args for plugins can now be specified separately from the command,\n   allowing the same output format and input format for plugin information\n   [[GH-3778](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3778)]\n * secret/pki: `ou` and `organization` can now be specified as a\n   comma-separated string or an array of strings [[GH-3804](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3804)]\n * plugins: Plugins will fall back to using netrpc as the communication protocol\n   on older versions of Vault [[GH-3833](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3833)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * auth/(approle,aws,cert): Fix behavior where periodic tokens generated by\n   these backends could not have their TTL renewed beyond the system/mount max\n   TTL value [[GH-3803](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3803)]\n * auth/aws: Fix error returned if `bound_iam_principal_arn` was given to an\n   existing role update [[GH-3843](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3843)]\n * core/sealwrap: Speed improvements and bug fixes (Enterprise)\n * identity: Delete group alias when an external group is deleted [[GH-3773](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3773)]\n * legacymfa/duo: Fix intermittent panic when Duo could not be reached\n   [[GH-2030](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2030)]\n * secret/database: Fix a location where a lock could potentially not be\n   released, leading to deadlock [[GH-3774](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3774)]\n * secret/(all databases) Fix behavior where if a max TTL was specified but no\n   default TTL was specified the system/mount default TTL would be used but not\n   be capped by the local max TTL [[GH-3814](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3814)]\n * secret/database: Fix an issue where plugins were not closed properly if they\n   failed to initialize [[GH-3768](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3768)]\n * ui: mounting a secret backend will now properly set `max_lease_ttl` and\n   `default_lease_ttl` when specified - previously both fields set\n   `default_lease_ttl`.\n\n## 0.9.1 (December 21st, 2017)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * AppRole Case Sensitivity: In prior versions of Vault, `list` operations\n   against AppRole roles would require preserving case in the role name, even\n   though most other operations within AppRole are case-insensitive with\n   respect to the role name. This has been fixed; existing roles will behave as\n   they have in the past, but new roles will act case-insensitively in these\n   cases.\n * Token Auth Backend Roles parameter types: For `allowed_policies` and\n   `disallowed_policies` in role definitions in the token auth backend, input\n   can now be a comma-separated string or an array of strings. Reading a role\n   will now return arrays for these parameters.\n * Transit key exporting: You can now mark a key in the `transit` backend as\n   `exportable` at any time, rather than just at creation time; however, once\n   this value is set, it still cannot be unset.\n * PKI Secret Backend Roles parameter types: For `allowed_domains` and\n   `key_usage` in role definitions in the PKI secret backend, input\n   can now be a comma-separated string or an array of strings. Reading a role\n   will now return arrays for these parameters.\n * SSH Dynamic Keys Method Defaults to 2048-bit Keys: When using the dynamic\n   key method in the SSH backend, the default is now to use 2048-bit keys if no\n   specific key bit size is specified.\n * Consul Secret Backend lease handling: The `consul` secret backend can now\n   accept both strings and integer numbers of seconds for its lease value. The\n   value returned on a role read will be an integer number of seconds instead\n   of a human-friendly string.\n * Unprintable characters not allowed in API paths: Unprintable characters are\n   no longer allowed in names in the API (paths and path parameters), with an\n   extra restriction on whitespace characters. Allowed characters are those\n   that are considered printable by Unicode plus spaces.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Transit Backup/Restore**: The `transit` backend now supports a backup\n   operation that can export a given key, including all key versions and\n   configuration, as well as a restore operation allowing import into another\n   Vault.\n * **gRPC Database Plugins**: Database plugins now use gRPC for transport,\n   allowing them to be written in other languages.\n * **Nomad Secret Backend**: Nomad ACL tokens can now be generated and revoked\n   using Vault.\n * **TLS Cert Auth Backend Improvements**: The `cert` auth backend can now\n   match against custom certificate extensions via exact or glob matching, and\n   additionally supports max_ttl and periodic token toggles.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/cert: Support custom certificate constraints [[GH-3634](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3634)]\n * auth/cert: Support setting `max_ttl` and `period` [[GH-3642](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3642)]\n * audit/file: Setting a file mode of `0000` will now disable Vault from\n   automatically `chmod`ing the log file [[GH-3649](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3649)]\n * auth/github: The legacy MFA system can now be used with the GitHub auth\n   backend [[GH-3696](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3696)]\n * auth/okta: The legacy MFA system can now be used with the Okta auth backend\n   [[GH-3653](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3653)]\n * auth/token: `allowed_policies` and `disallowed_policies` can now be specified\n   as a comma-separated string or an array of strings [[GH-3641](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3641)]\n * command/server: The log level can now be specified with `VAULT_LOG_LEVEL`\n   [[GH-3721](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3721)]\n * core: Period values from auth backends will now be checked and applied to the\n   TTL value directly by core on login and renewal requests [[GH-3677](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3677)]\n * database/mongodb: Add optional `write_concern` parameter, which can be set\n   during database configuration.

This performs a similar function to\n   `key_label` but for the HMAC key Vault will use. Vault will generate a\n   suitable key if this value is specified and `generate_key` is set true.\n * API HTTP client behavior: When calling `NewClient` the API no longer\n   modifies the provided client/transport. In particular this means it will no\n   longer enable redirection limiting and HTTP/2 support on custom clients. It\n   is suggested that if you want to make changes to an HTTP client that you use\n   one created by `DefaultConfig` as a starting point.\n * AWS EC2 client nonce behavior: The client nonce generated by the backend\n   that gets returned along with the authentication response will be audited in\n   plaintext. If this is undesired, the clients can choose to supply a custom\n   nonce to the login endpoint. The custom nonce set by the client will from\n   now on, not be returned back with the authentication response, and hence not\n   audit logged.\n * AWS Auth role options: The API will now error when trying to create or\n   update a role with the mutually-exclusive options\n   `disallow_reauthentication` and `allow_instance_migration`.\n * SSH CA role read changes: When reading back a role from the `ssh` backend,\n   the TTL/max TTL values will now be an integer number of seconds rather than\n   a string. This better matches the API elsewhere in Vault.\n * SSH role list changes: When listing roles from the `ssh` backend via the API,\n   the response data will additionally return a `key_info` map that will contain\n   a map of each key with a corresponding object containing the `key_type`.\n * More granularity in audit logs: Audit request and response entries are still\n   in RFC3339 format but now have a granularity of nanoseconds.\n * High availability related values have been moved out of the `storage` and\n   `ha_storage` stanzas, and into the top-level configuration. `redirect_addr`\n   has been renamed to `api_addr`. The stanzas still support accepting\n   HA-related values to maintain backward compatibility, but top-level values\n   will take precedence.\n * A new `seal` stanza has been added to the configuration file, which is\n   optional and enables configuration of the seal type to use for additional\n   data protection, such as using HSM or Cloud KMS solutions to encrypt and\n   decrypt data.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **RSA Support for Transit Backend**: Transit backend can now generate RSA\n   keys which can be used for encryption and signing. [[GH-3489](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3489)]\n * **Identity System**: Now in open source and with significant enhancements,\n   Identity is an integrated system for understanding users across tokens and\n   enabling easier management of users directly and via groups.\n * **External Groups in Identity**: Vault can now automatically assign users\n   and systems to groups in Identity based on their membership in external\n   groups.\n * **Seal Wrap / FIPS 140-2 Compatibility (Enterprise)**: Vault can now take\n   advantage of FIPS 140-2-certified HSMs to ensure that Critical Security\n   Parameters are protected in a compliant fashion. Vault's implementation has\n   received a statement of compliance from Leidos.\n * **Control Groups (Enterprise)**: Require multiple members of an Identity\n   group to authorize a requested action before it is allowed to run.\n * **Cloud Auto-Unseal (Enterprise)**: Automatically unseal Vault using AWS KMS\n   and GCP CKMS.\n * **Sentinel Integration (Enterprise)**: Take advantage of HashiCorp Sentinel\n   to create extremely flexible access control policies -- even on\n   unauthenticated endpoints.\n * **Barrier Rekey Support for Auto-Unseal (Enterprise)**: When using auto-unsealing\n   functionality, the `rekey` operation is now supported; it uses recovery keys\n   to authorize the master key rekey.\n * **Operation Token for Disaster Recovery Actions (Enterprise)**: When using\n   Disaster Recovery replication, a token can be created that can be used to\n   authorize actions such as promotion and updating primary information, rather\n   than using recovery keys.\n * **Trigger Auto-Unseal with Recovery Keys (Enterprise)**: When using\n   auto-unsealing, a request to unseal Vault can be triggered by a threshold of\n   recovery keys, rather than requiring the Vault process to be restarted.\n * **UI Redesign (Enterprise)**: All new experience for the Vault Enterprise\n   UI. The look and feel has been completely redesigned to give users a better\n   experience and make managing secrets fast and easy.\n * **UI: SSH Secret Backend (Enterprise)**: Configure an SSH secret backend,\n   create and browse roles. And use them to sign keys or generate one time\n   passwords.\n * **UI: AWS Secret Backend (Enterprise)**: You can now configure the AWS\n   backend via the Vault Enterprise UI. In addition you can create roles,\n   browse the roles and Generate IAM Credentials from them in the UI.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * api: Add ability to set custom headers on each call [[GH-3394](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3394)]\n * command/server: Add config option to disable requesting client certificates\n   [[GH-3373](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3373)]\n * auth/aws: Max retries can now be customized for the AWS client [[GH-3965](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3965)]\n * core: Disallow mounting underneath an existing path, not just over [[GH-2919](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2919)]\n * physical/file: Use `700` as permissions when creating directories.

Please note that the `default` policy will continue\n   to be added to generated tokens, however, rather than backends adding\n   `default` to the given set of input policies (in some cases, and not in\n   others), the stored set will reflect the user-specified set.\n * `sign-self-issued` modifies Issuer in generated certificates: In 0.8.2 the\n   endpoint would not modify the Issuer in the generated certificate, leaving\n   the output self-issued. Although theoretically valid, in practice crypto\n   stacks were unhappy validating paths containing such certs. As a result,\n   `sign-self-issued` now encodes the signing CA's Subject DN into the Issuer\n   DN of the generated certificate.\n * `sys/raw` requires enabling: While the `sys/raw` endpoint can be extremely\n   useful in break-glass or support scenarios, it is also extremely dangerous.\n   As of now, a configuration file option `raw_storage_endpoint` must be set in\n   order to enable this API endpoint. Once set, the available functionality has\n   been enhanced slightly; it now supports listing and decrypting most of\n   Vault's core data structures, except for the encryption keyring itself.\n * `generic` is now `kv`: To better reflect its actual use, the `generic`\n   backend is now `kv`. Using `generic` will still work for backwards\n   compatibility.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **GCE Support for GCP Auth**: GCE instances can now authenticate to Vault\n   using machine credentials.\n * **Support for Kubernetes Service Account Auth**: Kubernetes Service Accounts\n   can now authenticate to vault using JWT tokens.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * configuration: Provide a config option to store Vault server's process ID\n   (PID) in a file [[GH-3321](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3321)]\n * mfa (Enterprise): Add the ability to use identity metadata in username format\n * mfa/okta (Enterprise): Add support for configuring base_url for API calls\n * secret/pki: `sign-intermediate` will now allow specifying a `ttl` value\n   longer than the signing CA certificate's NotAfter value.

This could lead to\n  tokens expiring unexpectedly, or a token lifetime being longer than expected.\n  Upon token renewal with Vault 0.8.2 the period will be properly enforced.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n* `vault ssh` users should supply `-mode` and `-role` to reduce the number of\n  API calls. A future version of Vault will mark these optional values are\n  required. Failure to supply `-mode` or `-role` will result in a warning.\n* Vault plugins will first briefly run a restricted version of the plugin to\n  fetch metadata, and then lazy-load the plugin on first request to prevent\n  crash/deadlock of Vault during the unseal process. Plugins will need to be\n  built with the latest changes in order for them to run properly.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n* **Lazy Lease Loading**: On startup, Vault will now load leases from storage\n  in a lazy fashion (token checks and revocation/renewal requests still force\n  an immediate load). For larger installations this can significantly reduce\n  downtime when switching active nodes or bringing Vault up from cold start.\n* **SSH CA Login with `vault ssh`**: `vault ssh` now supports the SSH CA\n  backend for authenticating to machines. It also supports remote host key\n  verification through the SSH CA backend, if enabled.\n* **Signing of Self-Issued Certs in PKI**: The `pki` backend now supports\n  signing self-issued CA certs. This is useful when switching root CAs.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * audit/file: Allow specifying `stdout` as the `file_path` to log to standard\n   output [[GH-3235](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3235)]\n * auth/aws: Allow wildcards in `bound_iam_principal_arn` [[GH-3213](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3213)]\n * auth/okta: Compare groups case-insensitively since Okta is only\n   case-preserving [[GH-3240](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3240)]\n * auth/okta: Standardize Okta configuration APIs across backends [[GH-3245](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3245)]\n * cli: Add subcommand autocompletion that can be enabled with\n   `vault -autocomplete-install` [[GH-3223](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3223)]\n * cli: Add ability to handle wrapped responses when using `vault auth`.

This is available as\n   both a plugin and built-in to Vault.\n * **PingID Push Support for Path-Based MFA (Enterprise)**: PingID Push can\n   now be used for MFA with the new path-based MFA introduced in Vault\n   Enterprise 0.8.\n * **Permitted DNS Domains Support in PKI**: The `pki` backend now supports\n   specifying permitted DNS domains for CA certificates, allowing you to\n   narrowly scope the set of domains for which a CA can issue or sign child\n   certificates.\n * **Plugin Backend Reload Endpoint**: Plugin backends can now be triggered to\n   reload using the `sys/plugins/reload/backend` endpoint and providing either\n   the plugin name or the mounts to reload.\n * **Self-Reloading Plugins**: The plugin system will now attempt to reload a\n   crashed or stopped plugin, once per request.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/approle: Allow array input for policies in addition to comma-delimited\n   strings [[GH-3163](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3163)]\n * plugins: Send logs through Vault's logger rather than stdout [[GH-3142](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3142)]\n * secret/pki: Add `pki/root` delete operation [[GH-3165](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3165)]\n * secret/pki: Don't overwrite an existing root cert/key when calling generate\n   [[GH-3165](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3165)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * aws: Don't prefer a nil HTTP client over an existing one [[GH-3159](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3159)]\n * core: If there is an error when checking for create/update existence, return\n   500 instead of 400 [[GH-3162](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3162)]\n * secret/database: Avoid creating usernames that are too long for legacy MySQL\n   [[GH-3138](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3138)]\n\n## 0.8.0 (August 9th, 2017)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n * We've added a note to the docs about the way the GitHub auth backend works\n   as it may not be readily apparent that GitHub personal access tokens, which\n   are used by the backend, can be used for unauthorized access if they are\n   stolen from third party services and access to Vault is public.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * Database Plugin Backends: Passwords generated for these backends now\n   enforce stricter password requirements, as opposed to the previous behavior\n   of returning a randomized UUID. Passwords are of length 20, and have a `A1a-`\n   characters prepended to ensure stricter requirements. No regressions are\n   expected from this change. (For database backends that were previously\n   substituting underscores for hyphens in passwords, this will remain the\n   case.)\n * Lease Endpoints: The endpoints `sys/renew`, `sys/revoke`, `sys/revoke-prefix`,\n   `sys/revoke-force` have been deprecated and relocated under `sys/leases`.\n   Additionally, the deprecated path `sys/revoke-force` now requires the `sudo`\n   capability.\n * Response Wrapping Lookup Unauthenticated: The `sys/wrapping/lookup` endpoint\n   is now unauthenticated. This allows introspection of the wrapping info by\n   clients that only have the wrapping token without then invalidating the\n   token. Validation functions/checks are still performed on the token.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Cassandra Storage**: Cassandra can now be used for Vault storage\n * **CockroachDB Storage**: CockroachDB can now be used for Vault storage\n * **CouchDB Storage**: CouchDB can now be used for Vault storage\n * **SAP HANA Database Plugin**: The `databases` backend can now manage users\n   for SAP HANA databases\n * **Plugin Backends**: Vault now supports running secret and auth backends as\n   plugins. Plugins can be mounted like normal backends and can be developed\n   independently from Vault.\n * **PROXY Protocol Support** Vault listeners can now be configured to honor\n   PROXY protocol v1 information to allow passing real client IPs into Vault. A\n   list of authorized addresses (IPs or subnets) can be defined and\n   accept/reject behavior controlled.\n * **Lease Lookup and Browsing in the Vault Enterprise UI**: Vault Enterprise UI\n   now supports lookup and listing of leases and the associated actions from the\n   `sys/leases` endpoints in the API. These are located in the new top level\n   navigation item \"Leases\".\n * **Filtered Mounts for Performance Mode Replication**: Whitelists or\n   blacklists of mounts can be defined per-secondary to control which mounts\n   are actually replicated to that secondary. This can allow targeted\n   replication of specific sets of data to specific geolocations/datacenters.\n * **Disaster Recovery Mode Replication (Enterprise Only)**: There is a new\n   replication mode, Disaster Recovery (DR), that performs full real-time\n   replication (including tokens and leases) to DR secondaries. DR secondaries\n   cannot handle client requests, but can be promoted to primary as needed for\n   failover.\n * **Manage New Replication Features in the Vault Enterprise UI**: Support for\n   Replication features in Vault Enterprise UI has expanded to include new DR\n   Replication mode and management of Filtered Mounts in Performance Replication\n   mode.\n * **Vault Identity (Enterprise Only)**: Vault's new Identity system allows\n   correlation of users across tokens. At present this is only used for MFA,\n   but will be the foundation of many other features going forward.\n * **Duo Push, Okta Push, and TOTP MFA For All Authenticated Paths (Enterprise\n   Only)**: A brand new MFA system built on top of Identity allows MFA\n   (currently Duo Push, Okta Push, and TOTP) for any authenticated path within\n   Vault. MFA methods can be configured centrally, and TOTP keys live within\n   the user's Identity information to allow using the same key across tokens.\n   Specific MFA method(s) required for any given path within Vault can be\n   specified in normal ACL path statements.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * api: Add client method for a secret renewer background process [[GH-2886](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2886)]\n * api: Add `RenewTokenAsSelf` [[GH-2886](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2886)]\n * api: Client timeout can now be adjusted with the `VAULT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT` env\n   var or with a new API function [[GH-2956](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2956)]\n * api/cli: Client will now attempt to look up SRV records for the given Vault\n   hostname [[GH-3035](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3035)]\n * audit/socket: Enhance reconnection logic and don't require the connection to\n   be established at unseal time [[GH-2934](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2934)]\n * audit/file: Opportunistically try re-opening the file on error [[GH-2999](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2999)]\n * auth/approle: Add role name to token metadata [[GH-2985](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2985)]\n * auth/okta: Allow specifying `ttl`/`max_ttl` inside the mount [[GH-2915](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2915)]\n * cli: Client timeout can now be adjusted with the `VAULT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT` env\n   var [[GH-2956](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2956)]\n * command/auth: Add `-token-only` flag to `vault auth` that returns only the\n   token on stdout and does not store it via the token helper [[GH-2855](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2855)]\n * core: CORS allowed origins can now be configured [[GH-2021](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2021)]\n * core: Add metrics counters for audit log failures [[GH-2863](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2863)]\n * cors: Allow setting allowed headers via the API instead of always using\n   wildcard [[GH-3023](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3023)]\n * secret/ssh: Allow specifying the key ID format using template values for CA\n   type [[GH-2888](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2888)]\n * server: Add `tls_client_ca_file` option for specifying a CA file to use for\n   client certificate verification when `tls_require_and_verify_client_cert` is\n   enabled [[GH-3034](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3034)]\n * storage/cockroachdb: Add CockroachDB storage backend [[GH-2713](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2713)]\n * storage/couchdb: Add CouchDB storage backend [[GH-2880](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2880)]\n * storage/mssql: Add `max_parallel` [[GH-3026](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3026)]\n * storage/postgresql: Add `max_parallel` [[GH-3026](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3026)]\n * storage/postgresql: Improve listing speed [[GH-2945](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2945)]\n * storage/s3: More efficient paging when an object has a lot of subobjects\n   [[GH-2780](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2780)]\n * sys/wrapping: Make `sys/wrapping/lookup` unauthenticated [[GH-3084](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3084)]\n * sys/wrapping: Wrapped tokens now store the original request path of the data\n   [[GH-3100](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3100)]\n * telemetry: Add support for DogStatsD [[GH-2490](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2490)]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * api/health: Don't treat standby `429` codes as an error [[GH-2850](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2850)]\n * api/leases: Fix lease lookup returning lease properties at the top level\n * audit: Fix panic when audit logging a read operation on an asymmetric\n   `transit` key [[GH-2958](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2958)]\n * auth/approle: Fix panic when secret and cidr list not provided in role\n   [[GH-3075](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3075)]\n * auth/aws: Look up proper account ID on token renew [[GH-3012](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3012)]\n * auth/aws: Store IAM header in all cases when it changes [[GH-3004](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3004)]\n * auth/ldap: Verify given certificate is PEM encoded instead of failing\n   silently [[GH-3016](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3016)]\n * auth/token: Don't allow using the same token ID twice when manually\n   specifying [[GH-2916](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2916)]\n * cli: Fix issue with parsing keys that start with special characters [[GH-2998](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2998)]\n * core: Relocated `sys/leases/renew` returns same payload as original\n   `sys/leases` endpoint [[GH-2891](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2891)]\n * secret/ssh: Fix panic when signing with incorrect key type [[GH-3072](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/3072)]\n * secret/totp: Ensure codes can only be used once.

This was done to make\n   it easier for administrators to control lifecycles of individual\n   certificates added to the backend, e.g. the authentication material being\n   checked was access to that specific certificate's private key rather than\n   all private keys signed by a CA. However, this behavior is often unexpected\n   and as a result can lead to insecure deployments, so we are now validating\n   these certificates as well.\n * App-ID path salting was skipped in 0.7.1/0.7.2: A regression in 0.7.1/0.7.2\n   caused the HMACing of any App-ID information stored in paths (including\n   actual app-IDs and user-IDs) to be unsalted and written as-is from the API.\n   In 0.7.3 any such paths will be automatically changed to salted versions on\n   access (e.g. login or read); however, if you created new app-IDs or user-IDs\n   in 0.7.1/0.7.2, you may want to consider whether any users with access to\n   Vault's underlying data store may have intercepted these values, and\n   revoke/roll them.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * Step-Down is Forwarded: When a step-down is issued against a non-active node\n   in an HA cluster, it will now forward the request to the active node.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **ed25519 Signing/Verification in Transit with Key Derivation**: The\n   `transit` backend now supports generating\n   [ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) keys for signing and verification\n   functionality. These keys support derivation, allowing you to modify the\n   actual encryption key used by supplying a `context` value.\n * **Key Version Specification for Encryption in Transit**: You can now specify\n   the version of a key you use to wish to generate a signature, ciphertext, or\n   HMAC. This can be controlled by the `min_encryption_version` key\n   configuration property.\n * **Replication Primary Discovery (Enterprise)**: Replication primaries will\n   now advertise the addresses of their local HA cluster members to replication\n   secondaries. This helps recovery if the primary active node goes down and\n   neither service discovery nor load balancers are in use to steer clients.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * api/health: Add Sys().Health() [[GH-2805](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2805)]\n * audit: Add auth information to requests that error out [[GH-2754](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2754)]\n * command/auth: Add `-no-store` option that prevents the auth command from\n   storing the returned token into the configured token helper [[GH-2809](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2809)]\n * core/forwarding: Request forwarding now heartbeats to prevent unused\n   connections from being terminated by firewalls or proxies\n * plugins/databases: Add MongoDB as an internal database plugin [[GH-2698](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2698)]\n * storage/dynamodb: Add a method for checking the existence of children,\n   speeding up deletion operations in the DynamoDB storage backend [[GH-2722](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2722)]\n * storage/mysql: Add max_parallel parameter to MySQL backend [[GH-2760](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2760)]\n * secret/databases: Support listing connections [[GH-2823](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2823)]\n * secret/databases: Support custom renewal statements in Postgres database\n   plugin [[GH-2788](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2788)]\n * secret/databases: Use the role name as part of generated credentials\n   [[GH-2812](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2812)]\n * ui (Enterprise): Transit key and secret browsing UI handle large lists better\n * ui (Enterprise): root tokens are no longer persisted\n * ui (Enterprise): support for mounting Database and TOTP secret backends\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * auth/app-id: Fix regression causing loading of salts to be skipped\n * auth/aws: Improve EC2 describe instances performance [[GH-2766](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2766)]\n * auth/aws: Fix lookup of some instance profile ARNs [[GH-2802](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2802)]\n * auth/aws: Resolve ARNs to internal AWS IDs which makes lookup at various\n   points (e.g. renewal time) more robust [[GH-2814](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2814)]\n * auth/aws: Properly honor configured period when using IAM authentication\n   [[GH-2825](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2825)]\n * auth/aws: Check that a bound IAM principal is not empty (in the current\n   state of the role) before requiring it match the previously authenticated\n   client [[GH-2781](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2781)]\n * auth/cert: Fix panic on renewal [[GH-2749](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2749)]\n * auth/cert: Certificate verification for non-CA certs [[GH-2761](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2761)]\n * core/acl: Prevent race condition when compiling ACLs in some scenarios\n   [[GH-2826](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2826)]\n * secret/database: Increase wrapping token TTL; in a loaded scenario it could\n   be too short\n * secret/generic: Allow integers to be set as the value of `ttl` field as the\n   documentation claims is supported [[GH-2699](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2699)]\n * secret/ssh: Added host key callback to ssh client config [[GH-2752](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2752)]\n * storage/s3: Avoid a panic when some bad data is returned [[GH-2785](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2785)]\n * storage/dynamodb: Fix list functions working improperly on Windows [[GH-2789](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2789)]\n * storage/file: Don't leak file descriptors in some error cases\n * storage/swift: Fix pre-v3 project/tenant name reading [[GH-2803](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2803)]\n\n## 0.7.2 (May 8th, 2017)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * audit: Fix auditing entries containing certain kinds of time values\n   [[GH-2689](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/2689)]\n\n## 0.7.1 (May 5th, 2017)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * LDAP Auth Backend: Group membership queries will now run as the `binddn`\n   user when `binddn`/`bindpass` are configured, rather than as the\n   authenticating user as was the case previously.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **AWS IAM Authentication**: IAM principals can get Vault tokens\n   automatically, opening AWS-based authentication to users, ECS containers,\n   Lambda instances, and more.

This has been fixed. We recommend\n   any users of this feature to upgrade to 0.7 as soon as feasible.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * List Operations Always Use Trailing Slash: Any list operation, whether via\n   the `GET` or `LIST` HTTP verb, will now internally canonicalize the path to\n   have a trailing slash. This makes policy writing more predictable, as it\n   means clients will no longer work or fail based on which client they're\n   using or which HTTP verb they're using. However, it also means that policies\n   allowing `list` capability must be carefully checked to ensure that they\n   contain a trailing slash; some policies may need to be split into multiple\n   stanzas to accommodate.\n * PKI Defaults to Unleased Certificates: When issuing certificates from the\n   PKI backend, by default, no leases will be issued. If you want to manually\n   revoke a certificate, its serial number can be used with the `pki/revoke`\n   endpoint. Issuing leases is still possible by enabling the `generate_lease`\n   toggle in PKI role entries (this will default to `true` for upgrades, to\n   keep existing behavior), which will allow using lease IDs to revoke\n   certificates. For installations issuing large numbers of certificates (tens\n   to hundreds of thousands, or millions), this will significantly improve\n   Vault startup time since leases associated with these certificates will not\n   have to be loaded; however note that it also means that revocation of a\n   token used to issue certificates will no longer add these certificates to a\n   CRL. If this behavior is desired or needed, consider keeping leases enabled\n   and ensuring lifetimes are reasonable, and issue long-lived certificates via\n   a different role with leases disabled.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Replication (Enterprise)**: Vault Enterprise now has support for creating\n   a multi-datacenter replication set between clusters. The current replication\n   offering is based on an asynchronous primary/secondary (1:N) model that\n   replicates static data while keeping dynamic data (leases, tokens)\n   cluster-local, focusing on horizontal scaling for high-throughput and\n   high-fanout deployments.\n * **Response Wrapping & Replication in the Vault Enterprise UI**: Vault\n   Enterprise UI now supports looking up and rotating response wrapping tokens,\n   as well as creating tokens with arbitrary values inside. It also now\n   supports replication functionality, enabling the configuration of a\n   replication set in the UI.\n * **Expanded Access Control Policies**: Access control policies can now\n   specify allowed and denied parameters -- and, optionally, their values -- to\n   control what a client can and cannot submit during an API call. Policies can\n   also specify minimum/maximum response wrapping TTLs to both enforce the use\n   of response wrapping and control the duration of resultant wrapping tokens.\n   See the [policies concepts\n   page](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html) for more\n   information.\n * **SSH Backend As Certificate Authority**: The SSH backend can now be\n   configured to sign host and user certificates. Each mount of the backend\n   acts as an independent signing authority. The CA key pair can be configured\n   for each mount and the public key is accessible via an unauthenticated API\n   call; additionally, the backend can generate a public/private key pair for\n   you. We recommend using separate mounts for signing host and user\n   certificates.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * api/request: Passing username and password information in API request\n   [GH-2469]\n * audit: Logging the token's use count with authentication response and\n   logging the remaining uses of the client token with request [GH-2437]\n * auth/approle: Support for restricting the number of uses on the tokens\n   issued [GH-2435]\n * auth/aws-ec2: AWS EC2 auth backend now supports constraints for VPC ID,\n   Subnet ID and Region [GH-2407]\n * auth/ldap: Use the value of the `LOGNAME` or `USER` env vars for the\n   username if not explicitly set on the command line when authenticating\n   [GH-2154]\n * audit: Support adding a configurable prefix (such as `@cee`) before each\n   line [GH-2359]\n * core: Canonicalize list operations to use a trailing slash [GH-2390]\n * core: Add option to disable caching on a per-mount level [GH-2455]\n * core: Add ability to require valid client certs in listener config [GH-2457]\n * physical/dynamodb: Implement a session timeout to avoid having to use\n   recovery mode in the case of an unclean shutdown, which makes HA much safer\n   [GH-2141]\n * secret/pki: O (Organization) values can now be set to role-defined values\n   for issued/signed certificates [GH-2369]\n * secret/pki: Certificates issued/signed from PKI backend do not generate\n   leases by default [GH-2403]\n * secret/pki: When using DER format, still return the private key type\n   [GH-2405]\n * secret/pki: Add an intermediate to the CA chain even if it lacks an\n   authority key ID [GH-2465]\n * secret/pki: Add role option to use CSR SANs [GH-2489]\n * secret/ssh: SSH backend as CA to sign user and host certificates [GH-2208]\n * secret/ssh: Support reading of SSH CA public key from `config/ca` endpoint\n   and also return it when CA key pair is generated [GH-2483]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * audit: When auditing headers use case-insensitive comparisons [GH-2362]\n * auth/aws-ec2: Return role period in seconds and not nanoseconds [GH-2374]\n * auth/okta: Fix panic if user had no local groups and/or policies set\n   [GH-2367]\n * command/server: Fix parsing of redirect address when port is not mentioned\n   [GH-2354]\n * physical/postgresql: Fix listing returning incorrect results if there were\n   multiple levels of children [GH-2393]\n\n## 0.6.5 (February 7th, 2017)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Okta Authentication**: A new Okta authentication backend allows you to use\n   Okta usernames and passwords to authenticate to Vault. If provided with an\n   appropriate Okta API token, group membership can be queried to assign\n   policies; users and groups can be defined locally as well.\n * **RADIUS Authentication**: A new RADIUS authentication backend allows using\n   a RADIUS server to authenticate to Vault. Policies can be configured for\n   specific users or for any authenticated user.\n * **Exportable Transit Keys**: Keys in `transit` can now be marked as\n   `exportable` at creation time. This allows a properly ACL'd user to retrieve\n   the associated signing key, encryption key, or HMAC key. The `exportable`\n   value is returned on a key policy read and cannot be changed, so if a key is\n   marked `exportable` it will always be exportable, and if it is not it will\n   never be exportable.\n * **Batch Transit Operations**: `encrypt`, `decrypt` and `rewrap` operations\n   in the transit backend now support processing multiple input items in one\n   call, returning the output of each item in the response.\n * **Configurable Audited HTTP Headers**: You can now specify headers that you\n   want to have included in each audit entry, along with whether each header\n   should be HMAC'd or kept plaintext. This can be useful for adding additional\n   client or network metadata to the audit logs.\n * **Transit Backend UI (Enterprise)**: Vault Enterprise UI now supports the transit\n   backend, allowing creation, viewing and editing of named keys as well as using\n   those keys to perform supported transit operations directly in the UI.\n * **Socket Audit Backend** A new socket audit backend allows audit logs to be sent\n   through TCP, UDP, or UNIX Sockets.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/aws-ec2: Add support for cross-account auth using STS [GH-2148]\n * auth/aws-ec2: Support issuing periodic tokens [GH-2324]\n * auth/github: Support listing teams and users [GH-2261]\n * auth/ldap: Support adding policies to local users directly, in addition to\n   local groups [GH-2152]\n * command/server: Add ability to select and prefer server cipher suites\n   [GH-2293]\n * core: Add a nonce to unseal operations as a check (useful mostly for\n   support, not as a security principle) [GH-2276]\n * duo: Added ability to supply extra context to Duo pushes [GH-2118]\n * physical/consul: Add option for setting consistency mode on Consul gets\n   [GH-2282]\n * physical/etcd: Full v3 API support; code will autodetect which API version\n   to use. The v3 code path is significantly less complicated and may be much\n   more stable. [GH-2168]\n * secret/pki: Allow specifying OU entries in generated certificate subjects\n   [GH-2251]\n * secret mount ui (Enterprise): the secret mount list now shows all mounted\n   backends even if the UI cannot browse them. Additional backends can now be\n   mounted from the UI as well.\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * auth/token: Fix regression in 0.6.4 where using token store roles as a\n   blacklist (with only `disallowed_policies` set) would not work in most\n   circumstances [GH-2286]\n * physical/s3: Page responses in client so list doesn't truncate [GH-2224]\n * secret/cassandra: Stop a connection leak that could occur on active node\n   failover [GH-2313]\n * secret/pki: When using `sign-verbatim`, don't require a role and use the\n   CSR's common name [GH-2243]\n\n## 0.6.4 (December 16, 2016)\n\nSECURITY:\n\nFurther details about these security issues can be found in the 0.6.4 upgrade\nguide.\n\n * `default` Policy Privilege Escalation: If a parent token did not have the\n   `default` policy attached to its token, it could still create children with\n   the `default` policy. This is no longer allowed (unless the parent has\n   `sudo` capability for the creation path). In most cases this is low severity\n   since the access grants in the `default` policy are meant to be access\n   grants that are acceptable for all tokens to have.\n * Leases Not Expired When Limited Use Token Runs Out of Uses: When using\n   limited-use tokens to create leased secrets, if the limited-use token was\n   revoked due to running out of uses (rather than due to TTL expiration or\n   explicit revocation) it would fail to revoke the leased secrets. These\n   secrets would still be revoked when their TTL expired, limiting the severity\n   of this issue. An endpoint has been added (`auth/token/tidy`) that can\n   perform housekeeping tasks on the token store; one of its tasks can detect\n   this situation and revoke the associated leases.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n  * **Policy UI (Enterprise)**: Vault Enterprise UI now supports viewing,\n    creating, and editing policies.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * http: Vault now sets a `no-store` cache control header to make it more\n   secure in setups that are not end-to-end encrypted [GH-2183]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * auth/ldap: Don't panic if dialing returns an error and starttls is enabled;\n   instead, return the error [GH-2188]\n * ui (Enterprise): Submitting an unseal key now properly resets the\n   form so a browser refresh isn't required to continue.\n\n## 0.6.3 (December 6, 2016)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * Request size limitation: A maximum request size of 32MB is imposed to\n   prevent a denial of service attack with arbitrarily large requests [GH-2108]\n * LDAP denies passwordless binds by default: In new LDAP mounts, or when\n   existing LDAP mounts are rewritten, passwordless binds will be denied by\n   default. The new `deny_null_bind` parameter can be set to `false` to allow\n   these. [GH-2103]\n * Any audit backend activated satisfies conditions: Previously, when a new\n   Vault node was taking over service in an HA cluster, all audit backends were\n   required to be loaded successfully to take over active duty. This behavior\n   now matches the behavior of the audit logging system itself: at least one\n   audit backend must successfully be loaded. The server log contains an error\n   when this occurs. This helps keep a Vault HA cluster working when there is a\n   misconfiguration on a standby node. [GH-2083]\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Web UI (Enterprise)**: Vault Enterprise now contains a built-in web UI\n   that offers access to a number of features, including init/unsealing/sealing,\n   authentication via userpass or LDAP, and K/V reading/writing. The capability\n   set of the UI will be expanding rapidly in further releases. To enable it,\n   set `ui = true` in the top level of Vault's configuration file and point a\n   web browser at your Vault address.\n * **Google Cloud Storage Physical Backend**: You can now use GCS for storing\n   Vault data [GH-2099]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/github: Policies can now be assigned to users as well as to teams\n   [GH-2079]\n * cli: Set the number of retries on 500 down to 0 by default (no retrying). It\n   can be very confusing to users when there is a pause while the retries\n   happen if they haven't explicitly set it. With request forwarding the need\n   for this is lessened anyways. [GH-2093]\n * core: Response wrapping is now allowed to be specified by backend responses\n   (requires backends gaining support) [GH-2088]\n * physical/consul: When announcing service, use the scheme of the Vault server\n   rather than the Consul client [GH-2146]\n * secret/consul: Added listing functionality to roles [GH-2065]\n * secret/postgresql: Added `revocation_sql` parameter on the role endpoint to\n   enable customization of user revocation SQL statements [GH-2033]\n * secret/transit: Add listing of keys [GH-1987]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * api/unwrap, command/unwrap: Increase compatibility of `unwrap` command with\n   Vault 0.6.1 and older [GH-2014]\n * api/unwrap, command/unwrap: Fix error when no client token exists [GH-2077]\n * auth/approle: Creating the index for the role_id properly [GH-2004]\n * auth/aws-ec2: Handle the case of multiple upgrade attempts when setting the\n   instance-profile ARN [GH-2035]\n * auth/ldap: Avoid leaking connections on login [GH-2130]\n * command/path-help: Use the actual error generated by Vault rather than\n   always using 500 when there is a path help error [GH-2153]\n * command/ssh: Use temporary file for identity and ensure its deletion before\n   the command returns [GH-2016]\n * cli: Fix error printing values with `-field` if the values contained\n   formatting directives [GH-2109]\n * command/server: Don't say mlock is supported on OSX when it isn't. [GH-2120]\n * core: Fix bug where a failure to come up as active node (e.g. if an audit\n   backend failed) could lead to deadlock [GH-2083]\n * physical/mysql: Fix potential crash during setup due to a query failure\n   [GH-2105]\n * secret/consul: Fix panic on user error [GH-2145]\n\n## 0.6.2 (October 5, 2016)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * Convergent Encryption v2: New keys in `transit` using convergent mode will\n   use a new nonce derivation mechanism rather than require the user to supply\n   a nonce. While not explicitly increasing security, it minimizes the\n   likelihood that a user will use the mode improperly and impact the security\n   of their keys. Keys in convergent mode that were created in v0.6.1 will\n   continue to work with the same mechanism (user-supplied nonce).\n * `etcd` HA off by default: Following in the footsteps of `dynamodb`, the\n   `etcd` storage backend now requires that `ha_enabled` be explicitly\n   specified in the configuration file. The backend currently has known broken\n   HA behavior, so this flag discourages use by default without explicitly\n   enabling it. If you are using this functionality, when upgrading, you should\n   set `ha_enabled` to `\"true\"` *before* starting the new versions of Vault.\n * Default/Max lease/token TTLs are now 32 days: In previous versions of Vault\n   the default was 30 days, but moving it to 32 days allows some operations\n   (e.g. reauthenticating, renewing, etc.) to be performed via a monthly cron\n   job.\n * AppRole Secret ID endpoints changed: Secret ID and Secret ID accessors are\n   no longer part of request URLs. The GET and DELETE operations are now moved\n   to new endpoints (`/lookup` and `/destroy`) which consumes the input from\n   the body and not the URL.\n * AppRole requires at least one constraint: previously it was sufficient to\n   turn off all AppRole authentication constraints (secret ID, CIDR block) and\n   use the role ID only. It is now required that at least one additional\n   constraint is enabled. Existing roles are unaffected, but any new roles or\n   updated roles will require this.\n * Reading wrapped responses from `cubbyhole/response` is deprecated. The\n   `sys/wrapping/unwrap` endpoint should be used instead as it provides\n   additional security, auditing, and other benefits. The ability to read\n   directly will be removed in a future release.\n * Request Forwarding is now on by default: in 0.6.1 this required toggling on,\n   but is now enabled by default. This can be disabled via the\n   `\"disable_clustering\"` parameter in Vault's\n   [config](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/config/index.html), or per-request\n   with the `X-Vault-No-Request-Forwarding` header.\n * In prior versions a bug caused the `bound_iam_role_arn` value in the\n   `aws-ec2` authentication backend to actually use the instance profile ARN.\n   This has been corrected, but as a result there is a behavior change. To\n   match using the instance profile ARN, a new parameter\n   `bound_iam_instance_profile_arn` has been added. Existing roles will\n   automatically transfer the value over to the correct parameter, but the next\n   time the role is updated, the new meanings will take effect.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Secret ID CIDR Restrictions in `AppRole`**: Secret IDs generated under an\n   approle can now specify a list of CIDR blocks from where the requests to\n   generate secret IDs should originate from. If an approle already has CIDR\n   restrictions specified, the CIDR restrictions on the secret ID should be a\n   subset of those specified on the role [GH-1910]\n * **Initial Root Token PGP Encryption**: Similar to `generate-root`, the root\n   token created at initialization time can now be PGP encrypted [GH-1883]\n * **Support Chained Intermediate CAs in `pki`**: The `pki` backend now allows,\n   when a CA cert is being supplied as a signed root or intermediate, a trust\n   chain of arbitrary length. The chain is returned as a parameter at\n   certificate issue/sign time and is retrievable independently as well.\n   [GH-1694]\n * **Response Wrapping Enhancements**: There are new endpoints to look up\n   response wrapped token parameters; wrap arbitrary values; rotate wrapping\n   tokens; and unwrap with enhanced validation. In addition, list operations\n   can now be response-wrapped. [GH-1927]\n * **Transit Features**: The `transit` backend now supports generating random\n   bytes and SHA sums; HMACs; and signing and verification functionality using\n   EC keys (P-256 curve)\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * api: Return error when an invalid (as opposed to incorrect) unseal key is\n   submitted, rather than ignoring it [GH-1782]\n * api: Add method to call `auth/token/create-orphan` endpoint [GH-1834]\n * api: Rekey operation now redirects from standbys to master [GH-1862]\n * audit/file: Sending a `SIGHUP` to Vault now causes Vault to close and\n   re-open the log file, making it easier to rotate audit logs [GH-1953]\n * auth/aws-ec2: EC2 instances can get authenticated by presenting the identity\n   document and its SHA256 RSA digest [GH-1961]\n * auth/aws-ec2: IAM bound parameters on the aws-ec2 backend will perform a\n   prefix match instead of exact match [GH-1943]\n * auth/aws-ec2: Added a new constraint `bound_iam_instance_profile_arn` to\n   refer to IAM instance profile ARN and fixed the earlier `bound_iam_role_arn`\n   to refer to IAM role ARN instead of the instance profile ARN [GH-1913]\n * auth/aws-ec2: Backend generates the nonce by default and clients can\n   explicitly disable reauthentication by setting empty nonce [GH-1889]\n * auth/token: Added warnings if tokens and accessors are used in URLs [GH-1806]\n * command/format: The `format` flag on select CLI commands takes `yml` as an\n   alias for `yaml` [GH-1899]\n * core: Allow the size of the read cache to be set via the config file, and\n   change the default value to 1MB (from 32KB) [GH-1784]\n * core: Allow single and two-character path parameters for most places\n   [GH-1811]\n * core: Allow list operations to be response-wrapped [GH-1814]\n * core: Provide better protection against timing attacks in Shamir code\n   [GH-1877]\n * core: Unmounting/disabling backends no longer returns an error if the mount\n   didn't exist. This is line with elsewhere in Vault's API where `DELETE` is\n   an idempotent operation. [GH-1903]\n * credential/approle: At least one constraint is required to be enabled while\n   creating and updating a role [GH-1882]\n * secret/cassandra: Added consistency level for use with roles [GH-1931]\n * secret/mysql: SQL for revoking user can be configured on the role [GH-1914]\n * secret/transit: Use HKDF (RFC 5869) as the key derivation function for new\n   keys [GH-1812]\n * secret/transit: Empty plaintext values are now allowed [GH-1874]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * audit: Fix panic being caused by some values logging as underlying Go types\n   instead of formatted strings [GH-1912]\n * auth/approle: Fixed panic on deleting approle that doesn't exist [GH-1920]\n * auth/approle: Not letting secret IDs and secret ID accessors to get logged\n   in plaintext in audit logs [GH-1947]\n * auth/aws-ec2: Allow authentication if the underlying host is in a bad state\n   but the instance is running [GH-1884]\n * auth/token: Fixed metadata getting missed out from token lookup response by\n   gracefully handling token entry upgrade [GH-1924]\n * cli: Don't error on newline in token file [GH-1774]\n * core: Pass back content-type header for forwarded requests [GH-1791]\n * core: Fix panic if the same key was given twice to `generate-root` [GH-1827]\n * core: Fix potential deadlock on unmount/remount [GH-1793]\n * physical/file: Remove empty directories from the `file` storage backend [GH-1821]\n * physical/zookeeper: Remove empty directories from the `zookeeper` storage\n   backend and add a fix to the `file` storage backend's logic [GH-1964]\n * secret/aws: Added update operation to `aws/sts` path to consider `ttl`\n   parameter [39b75c6]\n * secret/aws: Mark STS secrets as non-renewable [GH-1804]\n * secret/cassandra: Properly store session for re-use [GH-1802]\n * secret/ssh: Fix panic when revoking SSH dynamic keys [GH-1781]\n\n## 0.6.1 (August 22, 2016)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * Once the active node is 0.6.1, standby nodes must also be 0.6.1 in order to\n   connect to the HA cluster. We recommend following our [general upgrade\n   instructions](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/upgrade.html) in\n   addition to 0.6.1-specific upgrade instructions to ensure that this is not\n   an issue.\n * Status codes for sealed/uninitialized Vaults have changed to `503`/`501`\n   respectively. See the [version-specific upgrade\n   guide](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/upgrade-to-0.6.1.html) for\n   more details.\n * Root tokens (tokens with the `root` policy) can no longer be created except\n   by another root token or the `generate-root` endpoint.\n * Issued certificates from the `pki` backend against new roles created or\n   modified after upgrading will contain a set of default key usages.\n * The `dynamodb` physical data store no longer supports HA by default. It has\n   some non-ideal behavior around failover that was causing confusion. See the\n   [documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/config/index.html#ha_enabled)\n   for information on enabling HA mode. It is very important that this\n   configuration is added _before upgrading_.\n * The `ldap` backend no longer searches for `memberOf` groups as part of its\n   normal flow. Instead, the desired group filter must be specified. This fixes\n   some errors and increases speed for directories with different structures,\n   but if this behavior has been relied upon, ensure that you see the upgrade\n   notes _before upgrading_.\n * `app-id` is now deprecated with the addition of the new AppRole backend.\n   There are no plans to remove it, but we encourage using AppRole whenever\n   possible, as it offers enhanced functionality and can accommodate many more\n   types of authentication paradigms.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **AppRole Authentication Backend**: The `approle` backend is a\n   machine-oriented authentication backend that provides a similar concept to\n   App-ID while adding many missing features, including a pull model that\n   allows for the backend to generate authentication credentials rather than\n   requiring operators or other systems to push credentials in. It should be\n   useful in many more situations than App-ID. The inclusion of this backend\n   deprecates App-ID. [GH-1426]\n * **Request Forwarding**: Vault servers can now forward requests to each other\n   rather than redirecting clients. This feature is off by default in 0.6.1 but\n   will be on by default in the next release. See the [HA concepts\n   page](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/ha.html) for information on\n   enabling and configuring it. [GH-443]\n * **Convergent Encryption in `Transit`**: The `transit` backend now supports a\n   convergent encryption mode where the same plaintext will produce the same\n   ciphertext. Although very useful in some situations, this has potential\n   security implications, which are mostly mitigated by requiring the use of\n   key derivation when convergent encryption is enabled. See [the `transit`\n   backend\n   documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit/index.html)\n   for more details. [GH-1537]\n * **Improved LDAP Group Filters**: The `ldap` auth backend now uses templates\n   to define group filters, providing the capability to support some\n   directories that could not easily be supported before (especially specific\n   Active Directory setups with nested groups). [GH-1388]\n * **Key Usage Control in `PKI`**: Issued certificates from roles created or\n   modified after upgrading contain a set of default key usages for increased\n   compatibility with OpenVPN and some other software. This set can be changed\n   when writing a role definition. Existing roles are unaffected. [GH-1552]\n * **Request Retrying in the CLI and Go API**: Requests that fail with a `5xx`\n   error code will now retry after a backoff. The maximum total number of\n   retries (including disabling this functionality) can be set with an\n   environment variable. See the [environment variable\n   documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/environment.html)\n   for more details. [GH-1594]\n * **Service Discovery in `vault init`**: The new `-auto` option on `vault init`\n   will perform service discovery using Consul. When only one node is discovered,\n   it will be initialized and when more than one node is discovered, they will\n   be output for easy selection. See `vault init --help` for more details. [GH-1642]\n * **MongoDB Secret Backend**: Generate dynamic unique MongoDB database\n   credentials based on configured roles. Sponsored by\n   [CommerceHub](http://www.commercehub.com/). [GH-1414]\n * **Circonus Metrics Integration**: Vault can now send metrics to\n   [Circonus](http://www.circonus.com/). See the [configuration\n   documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/config/index.html) for\n   details. [GH-1646]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * audit: Added a unique identifier to each request which will also be found in\n   the request portion of the response.

The end result was that either endpoint\n   could revoke both secret leases and tokens. We consider this a very minor\n   security issue as there are a number of mitigating factors: both endpoints\n   require `sudo` capability in addition to write capability, preventing\n   blanket ACL path globs from providing access; both work by using the prefix\n   to revoke as a part of the endpoint path, allowing them to be properly\n   ACL'd; and both are intended for emergency scenarios and users should\n   already not generally have access to either one. In order to prevent\n   confusion, we have simply removed `auth/token/revoke-prefix` in 0.6, and\n   `sys/revoke-prefix` will be meant for both leases and tokens instead.\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * `auth/token/revoke-prefix` has been removed. See the security notice for\n   details. [GH-1280]\n * Vault will now automatically register itself as the `vault` service when\n   using the `consul` backend and will perform its own health checks.  See\n   the Consul backend documentation for information on how to disable\n   auto-registration and service checks.\n * List operations that do not find any keys now return a `404` status code\n   rather than an empty response object [GH-1365]\n * CA certificates issued from the `pki` backend no longer have associated\n   leases, and any CA certs already issued will ignore revocation requests from\n   the lease manager. This is to prevent CA certificates from being revoked\n   when the token used to issue the certificate expires; it was not be obvious\n   to users that they need to ensure that the token lifetime needed to be at\n   least as long as a potentially very long-lived CA cert.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **AWS EC2 Auth Backend**: Provides a secure introduction mechanism for AWS\n   EC2 instances allowing automated retrieval of Vault tokens. Unlike most\n   Vault authentication backends, this backend does not require first deploying\n   or provisioning security-sensitive credentials (tokens, username/password,\n   client certificates, etc). Instead, it treats AWS as a Trusted Third Party\n   and uses the cryptographically signed dynamic metadata information that\n   uniquely represents each EC2 instance. [Vault\n   Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/vault.html) customers have access to a\n   turnkey client that speaks the backend API and makes access to a Vault token\n   easy.\n * **Response Wrapping**: Nearly any response within Vault can now be wrapped\n   inside a single-use, time-limited token's cubbyhole, taking the [Cubbyhole\n   Authentication\n   Principles](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-cubbyhole-principles.html)\n   mechanism to its logical conclusion. Retrieving the original response is as\n   simple as a single API command or the new `vault unwrap` command. This makes\n   secret distribution easier and more secure, including secure introduction.\n * **Azure Physical Backend**: You can now use Azure blob object storage as\n   your Vault physical data store [GH-1266]\n * **Swift Physical Backend**: You can now use Swift blob object storage as\n   your Vault physical data store [GH-1425]\n * **Consul Backend Health Checks**: The Consul backend will automatically\n   register a `vault` service and perform its own health checking. By default\n   the active node can be found at `active.vault.service.consul` and all with\n   standby nodes are `standby.vault.service.consul`. Sealed vaults are marked\n   critical and are not listed by default in Consul's service discovery.  See\n   the documentation for details. [GH-1349]\n * **Explicit Maximum Token TTLs**: You can now set explicit maximum TTLs on\n   tokens that do not honor changes in the system- or mount-set values. This is\n   useful, for instance, when the max TTL of the system or the `auth/token`\n   mount must be set high to accommodate certain needs but you want more\n   granular restrictions on tokens being issued directly from the Token\n   authentication backend at `auth/token`. [GH-1399]\n * **Non-Renewable Tokens**: When creating tokens directly through the token\n   authentication backend, you can now specify in both token store roles and\n   the API whether or not a token should be renewable, defaulting to `true`.\n * **RabbitMQ Secret Backend**: Vault can now generate credentials for\n   RabbitMQ. Vhosts and tags can be defined within roles.

This only affected the value shown at lookup, not the token\n   behavior itself. [GH-1306]\n * command/various: Tell the JSON decoder to not convert all numbers to floats;\n   fixes some various places where numbers were showing up in scientific\n   notation\n * command/server: Prioritized `devRootTokenID` and `devListenAddress` flags\n   over their respective env vars [GH-1480]\n * command/ssh: Provided option to disable host key checking. The automated\n   variant of `vault ssh` command uses `sshpass` which was failing to handle\n   host key checking presented by the `ssh` binary. [GH-1473]\n * core: Properly persist mount-tuned TTLs for auth backends [GH-1371]\n * core: Don't accidentally crosswire SIGINT to the reload handler [GH-1372]\n * credential/github: Make organization comparison case-insensitive during\n   login [GH-1359]\n * credential/github: Fix panic when renewing a token created with some earlier\n   versions of Vault [GH-1510]\n * credential/github: The token used to log in via `vault auth` can now be\n   specified in the `VAULT_AUTH_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable [GH-1511]\n * credential/ldap: Fix problem where certain error conditions when configuring\n   or opening LDAP connections would cause a panic instead of return a useful\n   error message [GH-1262]\n * credential/token: Fall back to normal parent-token semantics if\n   `allowed_policies` is empty for a role.

Upon\n   investigation, we found that this behavior was reproducible in a specific\n   scenario: when a generated lease for a Consul ACL token had been renewed\n   prior to revocation. In this case, the generated token was not being\n   properly persisted internally through the renewal function, leading to an\n   error during revocation due to the missing token. Unfortunately, this was\n   coded as a user error rather than an internal error, and the revocation\n   logic was expecting internal errors if revocation failed. As a result, the\n   revocation logic believed the revocation to have succeeded when it in fact\n   failed, causing the lease to be dropped while the token was still valid\n   within Consul. In this release, the Consul backend properly persists the\n   token through renewals, and the revocation logic has been changed to\n   consider any error type to have been a failure to revoke, causing the lease\n   to persist and attempt to be revoked later.\n\nWe have written an example shell script that searches through Consul's ACL\ntokens and looks for those generated by Vault, which can be used as a template\nfor a revocation script as deemed necessary for any particular security\nresponse. The script is available at\nhttps://gist.github.com/jefferai/6233c2963f9407a858d84f9c27d725c0\n\nPlease note that any outstanding leases for Consul tokens produced prior to\n0.5.3 that have been renewed will continue to exhibit this behavior. As a\nresult, we recommend either revoking all tokens produced by the backend and\nissuing new ones, or if needed, a more advanced variant of the provided example\ncould use the timestamp embedded in each generated token's name to decide which\ntokens are too old and should be deleted. This could then be run periodically\nup until the maximum lease time for any outstanding pre-0.5.3 tokens has\nexpired.\n\nThis is a security-only release. There are no other code changes since 0.5.2.\nThe binaries have one additional change: they are built against Go 1.6.1 rather\nthan Go 1.6, as Go 1.6.1 contains two security fixes to the Go programming\nlanguage itself.\n\n## 0.5.2 (March 16th, 2016)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **MSSQL Backend**: Generate dynamic unique MSSQL database credentials based\n   on configured roles [GH-998]\n * **Token Accessors**: Vault now provides an accessor with each issued token.\n   This accessor is an identifier that can be used for a limited set of\n   actions, notably for token revocation. This value can be logged in\n   plaintext to audit logs, and in combination with the plaintext metadata\n   logged to audit logs, provides a searchable and straightforward way to\n   revoke particular users' or services' tokens in many cases. To enable\n   plaintext audit logging of these accessors, set `hmac_accessor=false` when\n   enabling an audit backend.\n * **Token Credential Backend Roles**: Roles can now be created in the `token`\n   credential backend that allow modifying token behavior in ways that are not\n   otherwise exposed or easily delegated. This allows creating tokens with a\n   fixed set (or subset) of policies (rather than a subset of the calling\n   token's), periodic tokens with a fixed TTL but no expiration, specified\n   prefixes, and orphans.\n * **Listener Certificate Reloading**: Vault's configured listeners now reload\n   their TLS certificate and private key when the Vault process receives a\n   SIGHUP.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * auth/token: Endpoints optionally accept tokens from the HTTP body rather\n   than just from the URLs [GH-1211]\n * auth/token,sys/capabilities: Added new endpoints\n   `auth/token/lookup-accessor`, `auth/token/revoke-accessor` and\n   `sys/capabilities-accessor`, which enables performing the respective actions\n   with just the accessor of the tokens, without having access to the actual\n   token [GH-1188]\n * core: Ignore leading `/` in policy paths [GH-1170]\n * core: Ignore leading `/` in mount paths [GH-1172]\n * command/policy-write: Provided HCL is now validated for format violations\n   and provides helpful information around where the violation occurred\n   [GH-1200]\n * command/server: The initial root token ID when running in `-dev` mode can\n   now be specified via `-dev-root-token-id` or the environment variable\n   `VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID` [GH-1162]\n * command/server: The listen address when running in `-dev` mode can now be\n   specified via `-dev-listen-address` or the environment variable\n   `VAULT_DEV_LISTEN_ADDRESS` [GH-1169]\n * command/server: The configured listeners now reload their TLS\n   certificates/keys when Vault is SIGHUP'd [GH-1196]\n * command/step-down: New `vault step-down` command and API endpoint to force\n   the targeted node to give up active status, but without sealing. The node\n   will wait ten seconds before attempting to grab the lock again. [GH-1146]\n * command/token-renew: Allow no token to be passed in; use `renew-self` in\n   this case. Change the behavior for any token being passed in to use `renew`.\n   [GH-1150]\n * credential/app-id: Allow `app-id` parameter to be given in the login path;\n   this causes the `app-id` to be part of the token path, making it easier to\n   use with `revoke-prefix` [GH-424]\n * credential/cert: Non-CA certificates can be used for authentication. They\n   must be matched exactly (issuer and serial number) for authentication, and\n   the certificate must carry the client authentication or 'any' extended usage\n   attributes. [GH-1153]\n * credential/cert: Subject and Authority key IDs are output in metadata; this\n   allows more flexible searching/revocation in the audit logs [GH-1183]\n * credential/cert: Support listing configured certs [GH-1212]\n * credential/userpass: Add support for `create`/`update` capability\n   distinction in user path, and add user-specific endpoints to allow changing\n   the password and policies [GH-1216]\n * credential/token: Add roles [GH-1155]\n * secret/mssql: Add MSSQL backend [GH-998]\n * secret/pki: Add revocation time (zero or Unix epoch) to `pki/cert/SERIAL`\n   endpoint [GH-1180]\n * secret/pki: Sanitize serial number in `pki/revoke` endpoint to allow some\n   other formats [GH-1187]\n * secret/ssh: Added documentation for `ssh/config/zeroaddress` endpoint.\n   [GH-1154]\n * sys: Added new endpoints `sys/capabilities` and `sys/capabilities-self` to\n   fetch the capabilities of a token on a given path [GH-1171]\n * sys: Added `sys/revoke-force`, which enables a user to ignore backend errors\n   when revoking a lease, necessary in some emergency/failure scenarios\n   [GH-1168]\n * sys: The return codes from `sys/health` can now be user-specified via query\n   parameters [GH-1199]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * logical/cassandra: Apply hyphen/underscore replacement to the entire\n   generated username, not just the UUID, in order to handle token display name\n   hyphens [GH-1140]\n * physical/etcd: Output actual error when cluster sync fails [GH-1141]\n * vault/expiration: Not letting the error responses from the backends to skip\n   during renewals [GH-1176]\n\n## 0.5.1 (February 25th, 2016)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * RSA keys less than 2048 bits are no longer supported in the PKI backend.\n   1024-bit keys are considered unsafe and are disallowed in the Internet PKI.\n   The `pki` backend has enforced SHA256 hashes in signatures from the\n   beginning, and software that can handle these hashes should be able to\n   handle larger key sizes. [GH-1095]\n * The PKI backend now does not automatically delete expired certificates,\n   including from the CRL. Doing so could lead to a situation where a time\n   mismatch between the Vault server and clients could result in a certificate\n   that would not be considered expired by a client being removed from the CRL.\n   The new `pki/tidy` endpoint can be used to trigger expirations. [GH-1129]\n * The `cert` backend now performs a variant of channel binding at renewal time\n   for increased security. In order to not overly burden clients, a notion of\n   identity is used. This functionality can be disabled. See the 0.5.1 upgrade\n   guide for more specific information [GH-1127]\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Codebase Audit**: Vault's 0.5 codebase was audited by iSEC. (The terms of\n   the audit contract do not allow us to make the results public.) [GH-220]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * api: The `VAULT_TLS_SERVER_NAME` environment variable can be used to control\n   the SNI header during TLS connections [GH-1131]\n * api/health: Add the server's time in UTC to health responses [GH-1117]\n * command/rekey and command/generate-root: These now return the status at\n   attempt initialization time, rather than requiring a separate fetch for the\n   nonce [GH-1054]\n * credential/cert: Don't require root/sudo tokens for the `certs/` and `crls/`\n   paths; use normal ACL behavior instead [GH-468]\n * credential/github: The validity of the token used for login will be checked\n   at renewal time [GH-1047]\n * credential/github: The `config` endpoint no longer requires a root token;\n   normal ACL path matching applies\n * deps: Use the standardized Go 1.6 vendoring system\n * secret/aws: Inform users of AWS-imposed policy restrictions around STS\n   tokens if they attempt to use an invalid policy [GH-1113]\n * secret/mysql: The MySQL backend now allows disabling verification of the\n   `connection_url` [GH-1096]\n * secret/pki: Submitted CSRs are now verified to have the correct key type and\n   minimum number of bits according to the role. The exception is intermediate\n   CA signing and the `sign-verbatim` path [GH-1104]\n * secret/pki: New `tidy` endpoint to allow expunging expired certificates.\n   [GH-1129]\n * secret/postgresql: The PostgreSQL backend now allows disabling verification\n   of the `connection_url` [GH-1096]\n * secret/ssh: When verifying an OTP, return 400 if it is not valid instead of\n   204 [GH-1086]\n * credential/app-id: App ID backend will check the validity of app-id and user-id\n   during renewal time [GH-1039]\n * credential/cert: TLS Certificates backend, during renewal, will now match the\n   client identity with the client identity used during login [GH-1127]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * credential/ldap: Properly escape values being provided to search filters\n   [GH-1100]\n * secret/aws: Capping on length of usernames for both IAM and STS types\n   [GH-1102]\n * secret/pki: If a cert is not found during lookup of a serial number,\n   respond with a 400 rather than a 500 [GH-1085]\n * secret/postgresql: Add extra revocation statements to better handle more\n   permission scenarios [GH-1053]\n * secret/postgresql: Make connection_url work properly [GH-1112]\n\n## 0.5.0 (February 10, 2016)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n * Previous versions of Vault could allow a malicious user to hijack the rekey\n   operation by canceling an operation in progress and starting a new one. The\n   practical application of this is very small. If the user was an unseal key\n   owner, they could attempt to do this in order to either receive unencrypted\n   reseal keys or to replace the PGP keys used for encryption with ones under\n   their control. However, since this would invalidate any rekey progress, they\n   would need other unseal key holders to resubmit, which would be rather\n   suspicious during this manual operation if they were not also the original\n   initiator of the rekey attempt. If the user was not an unseal key holder,\n   there is no benefit to be gained; the only outcome that could be attempted\n   would be a denial of service against a legitimate rekey operation by sending\n   cancel requests over and over. Thanks to Josh Snyder for the report!\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * `s3` physical backend: Environment variables are now preferred over\n   configuration values. This makes it behave similar to the rest of Vault,\n   which, in increasing order of preference, uses values from the configuration\n   file, environment variables, and CLI flags. [GH-871]\n * `etcd` physical backend: `sync` functionality is now supported and turned on\n   by default. This can be disabled. [GH-921]\n * `transit`: If a client attempts to encrypt a value with a key that does not\n   yet exist, what happens now depends on the capabilities set in the client's\n   ACL policies. If the client has `create` (or `create` and `update`)\n   capability, the key will upsert as in the past. If the client has `update`\n   capability, they will receive an error. [GH-1012]\n * `token-renew` CLI command: If the token given for renewal is the same as the\n   client token, the `renew-self` endpoint will be used in the API. Given that\n   the `default` policy (by default) allows all clients access to the\n   `renew-self` endpoint, this makes it much more likely that the intended\n   operation will be successful. [GH-894]\n * Token `lookup`: the `ttl` value in the response now reflects the actual\n   remaining TTL rather than the original TTL specified when the token was\n   created; this value is now located in `creation_ttl` [GH-986]\n * Vault no longer uses grace periods on leases or token TTLs. Uncertainty\n   about the length grace period for any given backend could cause confusion\n   and uncertainty. [GH-1002]\n * `rekey`: Rekey now requires a nonce to be supplied with key shares. This\n   nonce is generated at the start of a rekey attempt and is unique for that\n   attempt.\n * `status`: The exit code for the `status` CLI command is now `2` for an\n   uninitialized Vault instead of `1`. `1` is returned for errors. This better\n   matches the rest of the CLI.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Split Data/High Availability Physical Backends**: You can now configure\n   two separate physical backends: one to be used for High Availability\n   coordination and another to be used for encrypted data storage. See the\n   [configuration\n   documentation](https://vaultproject.io/docs/config/index.html) for details.\n   [GH-395]\n * **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Policies can now use the `capabilities` set\n   to specify fine-grained control over operations allowed on a path, including\n   separation of `sudo` privileges from other privileges. These can be mixed\n   and matched in any way desired. The `policy` value is kept for backwards\n   compatibility. See the [updated policy\n   documentation](https://vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html) for\n   details. [GH-914]\n * **List Support**: Listing is now supported via the API and the new `vault\n   list` command. This currently supports listing keys in the `generic` and\n   `cubbyhole` backends and a few other places (noted in the IMPROVEMENTS\n   section below). Different parts of the API and backends will need to\n   implement list capabilities in ways that make sense to particular endpoints,\n   so further support will appear over time. [GH-617]\n * **Root Token Generation via Unseal Keys**: You can now use the\n   `generate-root` CLI command to generate new orphaned, non-expiring root\n   tokens in case the original is lost or revoked (accidentally or\n   purposefully). This requires a quorum of unseal key holders. The output\n   value is protected via any PGP key of the initiator's choosing or a one-time\n   pad known only to the initiator (a suitable pad can be generated via the\n   `-genotp` flag to the command. [GH-915]\n * **Unseal Key Archiving**: You can now optionally have Vault store your\n   unseal keys in your chosen physical store for disaster recovery purposes.\n   This option is only available when the keys are encrypted with PGP. [GH-907]\n * **Keybase Support for PGP Encryption Keys**: You can now specify Keybase\n   users when passing in PGP keys to the `init`, `rekey`, and `generate-root`\n   CLI commands.  Public keys for these users will be fetched automatically.\n   [GH-901]\n * **DynamoDB HA Physical Backend**: There is now a new, community-supported\n   HA-enabled physical backend using Amazon DynamoDB. See the [configuration\n   documentation](https://vaultproject.io/docs/config/index.html) for details.\n   [GH-878]\n * **PostgreSQL Physical Backend**: There is now a new, community-supported\n   physical backend using PostgreSQL. See the [configuration\n   documentation](https://vaultproject.io/docs/config/index.html) for details.\n   [GH-945]\n * **STS Support in AWS Secret Backend**: You can now use the AWS secret\n   backend to fetch STS tokens rather than IAM users. [GH-927]\n * **Speedups in the transit backend**: The `transit` backend has gained a\n   cache, and now loads only the working set of keys (e.g. from the\n   `min_decryption_version` to the current key version) into its working set.\n   This provides large speedups and potential memory savings when the `rotate`\n   feature of the backend is used heavily.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * cli: Output secrets sorted by key name [GH-830]\n * cli: Support YAML as an output format [GH-832]\n * cli: Show an error if the output format is incorrect, rather than falling\n   back to an empty table [GH-849]\n * cli: Allow setting the `advertise_addr` for HA via the\n   `VAULT_ADVERTISE_ADDR` environment variable [GH-581]\n * cli/generate-root: Add generate-root and associated functionality [GH-915]\n * cli/init: Add `-check` flag that returns whether Vault is initialized\n   [GH-949]\n * cli/server: Use internal functions for the token-helper rather than shelling\n   out, which fixes some problems with using a static binary in Docker or paths\n   with multiple spaces when launching in `-dev` mode [GH-850]\n * cli/token-lookup: Add token-lookup command [GH-892]\n * command/{init,rekey}: Allow ASCII-armored keychain files to be arguments for\n   `-pgp-keys` [GH-940]\n * conf: Use normal bool values rather than empty/non-empty for the\n   `tls_disable` option [GH-802]\n * credential/ldap: Add support for binding, both anonymously (to discover a\n   user DN) and via a username and password [GH-975]\n * credential/token: Add `last_renewal_time` to token lookup calls [GH-896]\n * credential/token: Change `ttl` to reflect the current remaining TTL; the\n   original value is in `creation_ttl` [GH-1007]\n * helper/certutil: Add ability to parse PKCS#8 bundles [GH-829]\n * logical/aws: You can now get STS tokens instead of IAM users [GH-927]\n * logical/cassandra: Add `protocol_version` parameter to set the CQL proto\n   version [GH-1005]\n * logical/cubbyhole: Add cubbyhole access to default policy [GH-936]\n * logical/mysql: Add list support for roles path [GH-984]\n * logical/pki: Fix up key usages being specified for CAs [GH-989]\n * logical/pki: Add list support for roles path [GH-985]\n * logical/pki: Allow `pem_bundle` to be specified as the format, which\n   provides a concatenated PEM bundle of returned values [GH-1008]\n * logical/pki: Add 30 seconds of slack to the validity start period to\n   accommodate some clock skew in machines [GH-1036]\n * logical/postgres: Add `max_idle_connections` parameter [GH-950]\n * logical/postgres: Add list support for roles path\n * logical/ssh: Add list support for roles path [GH-983]\n * logical/transit: Keys are archived and only keys between the latest version\n   and `min_decryption_version` are loaded into the working set. This can\n   provide a very large speed increase when rotating keys very often. [GH-977]\n * logical/transit: Keys are now cached, which should provide a large speedup\n   in most cases [GH-979]\n * physical/cache: Use 2Q cache instead of straight LRU [GH-908]\n * physical/etcd: Support basic auth [GH-859]\n * physical/etcd: Support sync functionality and enable by default [GH-921]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * api: Correct the HTTP verb used in the LookupSelf method [GH-887]\n * api: Fix the output of `Sys().MountConfig(...)` to return proper values\n   [GH-1017]\n * command/read: Fix panic when an empty argument was given [GH-923]\n * command/ssh: Fix panic when username lookup fails [GH-886]\n * core: When running in standalone mode, don't advertise that we are active\n   until post-unseal setup completes [GH-872]\n * core: Update go-cleanhttp dependency to ensure idle connections aren't\n   leaked [GH-867]\n * core: Don't allow tokens to have duplicate policies [GH-897]\n * core: Fix regression in `sys/renew` that caused information stored in the\n   Secret part of the response to be lost [GH-912]\n * physical: Use square brackets when setting an IPv6-based advertise address\n   as the auto-detected advertise address [GH-883]\n * physical/s3: Use an initialized client when using IAM roles to fix a\n   regression introduced against newer versions of the AWS Go SDK [GH-836]\n * secret/pki: Fix a condition where unmounting could fail if the CA\n   certificate was not properly loaded [GH-946]\n * secret/ssh: Fix a problem where SSH connections were not always closed\n   properly [GH-942]\n\nMISC:\n\n * Clarified our stance on support for community-derived physical backends.\n   See the [configuration\n   documentation](https://vaultproject.io/docs/config/index.html) for details.\n * Add `vault-java` to libraries [GH-851]\n * Various minor documentation fixes and improvements [GH-839] [GH-854]\n   [GH-861] [GH-876] [GH-899] [GH-900] [GH-904] [GH-923] [GH-924] [GH-958]\n   [GH-959] [GH-981] [GH-990] [GH-1024] [GH-1025]\n\nBUILD NOTE:\n\n * The HashiCorp-provided binary release of Vault 0.5.0 is built against a\n   patched version of Go 1.5.3 containing two specific bug fixes affecting TLS\n   certificate handling. These fixes are in the Go 1.6 tree and were\n   cherry-picked on top of stock Go 1.5.3. If you want to examine the way in\n   which the releases were built, please look at our [cross-compilation\n   Dockerfile](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/v0.5.0/scripts/cross/Dockerfile-patched-1.5.3).\n\n## 0.4.1 (January 13, 2016)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n  * Build against Go 1.5.3 to mitigate a security vulnerability introduced in\n    Go 1.5. For more information, please see\n    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/MEATuOi_ei4\n\nThis is a security-only release; other than the version number and building\nagainst Go 1.5.3, there are no changes from 0.4.0.\n\n## 0.4.0 (December 10, 2015)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\n * Policy Name Casing: Policy names are now normalized to lower-case on write,\n   helping prevent accidental case mismatches. For backwards compatibility,\n   policy names are not currently normalized when reading or deleting. [GH-676]\n * Default etcd port number: the default connection string for the `etcd`\n   physical store uses port 2379 instead of port 4001, which is the port used\n   by the supported version 2.x of etcd. [GH-753]\n * As noted below in the FEATURES section, if your Vault installation contains\n   a policy called `default`, new tokens created will inherit this policy\n   automatically.\n * In the PKI backend there have been a few minor breaking changes:\n   * The token display name is no longer a valid option for providing a base\n   domain for issuance. Since this name is prepended with the name of the\n   authentication backend that issued it, it provided a faulty use-case at best\n   and a confusing experience at worst. We hope to figure out a better\n   per-token value in a future release.\n   * The `allowed_base_domain` parameter has been changed to `allowed_domains`,\n   which accepts a comma-separated list of domains. This allows issuing\n   certificates with DNS subjects across multiple domains. If you had a\n   configured `allowed_base_domain` parameter, it will be migrated\n   automatically when the role is read (either via a normal read, or via\n   issuing a certificate).\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Significantly Enhanced PKI Backend**: The `pki` backend can now generate\n   and sign root CA certificates and intermediate CA CSRs. It can also now sign\n   submitted client CSRs, as well as a significant number of other\n   enhancements. See the updated documentation for the full API. [GH-666]\n * **CRL Checking for Certificate Authentication**: The `cert` backend now\n   supports pushing CRLs into the mount and using the contained serial numbers\n   for revocation checking. See the documentation for the `cert` backend for\n   more info. [GH-330]\n * **Default Policy**: Vault now ensures that a policy named `default` is added\n   to every token. This policy cannot be deleted, but it can be modified\n   (including to an empty policy). There are three endpoints allowed in the\n   default `default` policy, related to token self-management: `lookup-self`,\n   which allows a token to retrieve its own information, and `revoke-self` and\n   `renew-self`, which are self-explanatory. If your existing Vault\n   installation contains a policy called `default`, it will not be overridden,\n   but it will be added to each new token created. You can override this\n   behavior when using manual token creation (i.e. not via an authentication\n   backend) by setting the \"no_default_policy\" flag to true. [GH-732]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * api: API client now uses a 60 second timeout instead of indefinite [GH-681]\n * api: Implement LookupSelf, RenewSelf, and RevokeSelf functions for auth\n   tokens [GH-739]\n * api: Standardize environment variable reading logic inside the API; the CLI\n   now uses this but can still override via command-line parameters [GH-618]\n * audit: HMAC-SHA256'd client tokens are now stored with each request entry.\n   Previously they were only displayed at creation time; this allows much\n   better traceability of client actions. [GH-713]\n * audit: There is now a `sys/audit-hash` endpoint that can be used to generate\n   an HMAC-SHA256'd value from provided data using the given audit backend's\n   salt [GH-784]\n * core: The physical storage read cache can now be disabled via\n   \"disable_cache\" [GH-674]\n * core: The unsealing process can now be reset midway through (this feature\n   was documented before, but not enabled) [GH-695]\n * core: Tokens can now renew themselves [GH-455]\n * core: Base64-encoded PGP keys can be used with the CLI for `init` and\n   `rekey` operations [GH-653]\n * core: Print version on startup [GH-765]\n * core: Access to `sys/policy` and `sys/mounts` now uses the normal ACL system\n   instead of requiring a root token [GH-769]\n * credential/token: Display whether or not a token is an orphan in the output\n   of a lookup call [GH-766]\n * logical: Allow `.` in path-based variables in many more locations [GH-244]\n * logical: Responses now contain a \"warnings\" key containing a list of\n   warnings returned from the server. These are conditions that did not require\n   failing an operation, but of which the client should be aware. [GH-676]\n * physical/(consul,etcd): Consul and etcd now use a connection pool to limit\n   the number of outstanding operations, improving behavior when a lot of\n   operations must happen at once [GH-677] [GH-780]\n * physical/consul: The `datacenter` parameter was removed; It could not be\n   effective unless the Vault node (or the Consul node it was connecting to)\n   was in the datacenter specified, in which case it wasn't needed [GH-816]\n * physical/etcd: Support TLS-encrypted connections and use a connection pool\n   to limit the number of outstanding operations [GH-780]\n * physical/s3: The S3 endpoint can now be configured, allowing using\n   S3-API-compatible storage solutions [GH-750]\n * physical/s3: The S3 bucket can now be configured with the `AWS_S3_BUCKET`\n   environment variable [GH-758]\n * secret/consul: Management tokens can now be created [GH-714]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * api: API client now checks for a 301 response for redirects. Vault doesn't\n   generate these, but in certain conditions Go's internal HTTP handler can\n   generate them, leading to client errors.\n * cli: `token-create` now supports the `ttl` parameter in addition to the\n   deprecated `lease` parameter. [GH-688]\n * core: Return data from `generic` backends on the last use of a limited-use\n   token [GH-615]\n * core: Fix upgrade path for leases created in `generic` prior to 0.3 [GH-673]\n * core: Stale leader entries will now be reaped [GH-679]\n * core: Using `mount-tune` on the auth/token path did not take effect.\n   [GH-688]\n * core: Fix a potential race condition when (un)sealing the vault with metrics\n   enabled [GH-694]\n * core: Fix an error that could happen in some failure scenarios where Vault\n   could fail to revert to a clean state [GH-733]\n * core: Ensure secondary indexes are removed when a lease is expired [GH-749]\n * core: Ensure rollback manager uses an up-to-date mounts table [GH-771]\n * everywhere: Don't use http.DefaultClient, as it shares state implicitly and\n   is a source of hard-to-track-down bugs [GH-700]\n * credential/token: Allow creating orphan tokens via an API path [GH-748]\n * secret/generic: Validate given duration at write time, not just read time;\n   if stored durations are not parseable, return a warning and the default\n   duration rather than an error [GH-718]\n * secret/generic: Return 400 instead of 500 when `generic` backend is written\n   to with no data fields [GH-825]\n * secret/postgresql: Revoke permissions before dropping a user or revocation\n   may fail [GH-699]\n\nMISC:\n\n * Various documentation fixes and improvements [GH-685] [GH-688] [GH-697]\n   [GH-710] [GH-715] [GH-831]\n\n## 0.3.1 (October 6, 2015)\n\nSECURITY:\n\n * core: In certain failure scenarios, the full values of requests and\n   responses would be logged [GH-665]\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Settable Maximum Open Connections**: The `mysql` and `postgresql` backends\n   now allow setting the number of maximum open connections to the database,\n   which was previously capped to 2. [GH-661]\n * **Renewable Tokens for GitHub**: The `github` backend now supports\n   specifying a TTL, enabling renewable tokens. [GH-664]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * dist: linux-amd64 distribution was dynamically linked [GH-656]\n * credential/github: Fix acceptance tests [GH-651]\n\nMISC:\n\n * Various minor documentation fixes and improvements [GH-649] [GH-650]\n   [GH-654] [GH-663]\n\n## 0.3.0 (September 28, 2015)\n\nDEPRECATIONS/CHANGES:\n\nNote: deprecations and breaking changes in upcoming releases are announced\nahead of time on the \"vault-tool\" mailing list.\n\n * **Cookie Authentication Removed**: As of 0.3 the only way to authenticate is\n   via the X-Vault-Token header. Cookie authentication was hard to properly\n   test, could result in browsers/tools/applications saving tokens in plaintext\n   on disk, and other issues. [GH-564]\n * **Terminology/Field Names**: Vault is transitioning from overloading the\n   term \"lease\" to mean both \"a set of metadata\" and \"the amount of time the\n   metadata is valid\". The latter is now being referred to as TTL (or\n   \"lease_duration\" for backwards-compatibility); some parts of Vault have\n   already switched to using \"ttl\" and others will follow in upcoming releases.\n   In particular, the \"token\", \"generic\", and \"pki\" backends accept both \"ttl\"\n   and \"lease\" but in 0.4 only \"ttl\" will be accepted. [GH-528]\n * **Downgrade Not Supported**: Due to enhancements in the storage subsystem,\n   values written by Vault 0.3+ will not be able to be read by prior versions\n   of Vault. There are no expected upgrade issues, however, as with all\n   critical infrastructure it is recommended to back up Vault's physical\n   storage before upgrading.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **SSH Backend**: Vault can now be used to delegate SSH access to machines,\n   via a (recommended) One-Time Password approach or by issuing dynamic keys.\n   [GH-385]\n * **Cubbyhole Backend**: This backend works similarly to the \"generic\" backend\n   but provides a per-token workspace. This enables some additional\n   authentication workflows (especially for containers) and can be useful to\n   applications to e.g. store local credentials while being restarted or\n   upgraded, rather than persisting to disk. [GH-612]\n * **Transit Backend Improvements**: The transit backend now allows key\n   rotation and datakey generation. For rotation, data encrypted with previous\n   versions of the keys can still be decrypted, down to a (configurable)\n   minimum previous version; there is a rewrap function for manual upgrades of\n   ciphertext to newer versions. Additionally, the backend now allows\n   generating and returning high-entropy keys of a configurable bitsize\n   suitable for AES and other functions; this is returned wrapped by a named\n   key, or optionally both wrapped and plaintext for immediate use. [GH-626]\n * **Global and Per-Mount Default/Max TTL Support**: You can now set the\n   default and maximum Time To Live for leases both globally and per-mount.\n   Per-mount settings override global settings. Not all backends honor these\n   settings yet, but the maximum is a hard limit enforced outside the backend.\n   See the documentation for \"/sys/mounts/\" for details on configuring\n   per-mount TTLs.  [GH-469]\n * **PGP Encryption for Unseal Keys**: When initializing or rotating Vault's\n   master key, PGP/GPG public keys can now be provided. The output keys will be\n   encrypted with the given keys, in order. [GH-570]\n * **Duo Multifactor Authentication Support**: Backends that support MFA can\n   now use Duo as the mechanism. [GH-464]\n * **Performance Improvements**: Users of the \"generic\" backend will see a\n   significant performance improvement as the backend no longer creates leases,\n   although it does return TTLs (global/mount default, or set per-item) as\n   before.  [GH-631]\n * **Codebase Audit**: Vault's codebase was audited by iSEC. (The terms of the\n   audit contract do not allow us to make the results public.) [GH-220]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n * audit: Log entries now contain a time field [GH-495]\n * audit: Obfuscated audit entries now use hmac-sha256 instead of sha1 [GH-627]\n * backends: Add ability for a cleanup function to be called on backend unmount\n   [GH-608]\n * config: Allow specifying minimum acceptable TLS version [GH-447]\n * core: If trying to mount in a location that is already mounted, be more\n   helpful about the error [GH-510]\n * core: Be more explicit on failure if the issue is invalid JSON [GH-553]\n * core: Tokens can now revoke themselves [GH-620]\n * credential/app-id: Give a more specific error when sending a duplicate POST\n   to sys/auth/app-id [GH-392]\n * credential/github: Support custom API endpoints (e.g. for Github Enterprise)\n   [GH-572]\n * credential/ldap: Add per-user policies and option to login with\n   userPrincipalName [GH-420]\n * credential/token: Allow root tokens to specify the ID of a token being\n   created from CLI [GH-502]\n * credential/userpass: Enable renewals for login tokens [GH-623]\n * scripts: Use /usr/bin/env to find Bash instead of hardcoding [GH-446]\n * scripts: Use godep for build scripts to use same environment as tests\n   [GH-404]\n * secret/mysql: Allow reading configuration data [GH-529]\n * secret/pki: Split \"allow_any_name\" logic to that and \"enforce_hostnames\", to\n   allow for non-hostname values (e.g. for client certificates) [GH-555]\n * storage/consul: Allow specifying certificates used to talk to Consul\n   [GH-384]\n * storage/mysql: Allow SSL encrypted connections [GH-439]\n * storage/s3: Allow using temporary security credentials [GH-433]\n * telemetry: Put telemetry object in configuration to allow more flexibility\n   [GH-419]\n * testing: Disable mlock for testing of logical backends so as not to require\n   root [GH-479]\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n * audit/file: Do not enable auditing if file permissions are invalid [GH-550]\n * backends: Allow hyphens in endpoint patterns (fixes AWS and others) [GH-559]\n * cli: Fixed missing setup of client TLS certificates if no custom CA was\n   provided\n * cli/read: Do not include a carriage return when using raw field output\n   [GH-624]\n * core: Bad input data could lead to a panic for that session, rather than\n   returning an error [GH-503]\n * core: Allow SHA2-384/SHA2-512 hashed certificates [GH-448]\n * core: Do not return a Secret if there are no uses left on a token (since it\n   will be unable to be used) [GH-615]\n * core: Code paths that called lookup-self would decrement num_uses and\n   potentially immediately revoke a token [GH-552]\n * core: Some /sys/ paths would not properly redirect from a standby to the\n   leader [GH-499] [GH-551]\n * credential/aws: Translate spaces in a token's display name to avoid making\n   IAM unhappy [GH-567]\n * credential/github: Integration failed if more than ten organizations or\n   teams [GH-489]\n * credential/token: Tokens with sudo access to \"auth/token/create\" can now use\n   root-only options [GH-629]\n * secret/cassandra: Work around backwards-incompatible change made in\n   Cassandra 2.2 preventing Vault from properly setting/revoking leases\n   [GH-549]\n * secret/mysql: Use varbinary instead of varchar to avoid InnoDB/UTF-8 issues\n   [GH-522]\n * secret/postgres: Explicitly set timezone in connections [GH-597]\n * storage/etcd: Renew semaphore periodically to prevent leadership flapping\n   [GH-606]\n * storage/zk: Fix collisions in storage that could lead to data unavailability\n   [GH-411]\n\nMISC:\n\n * Various documentation fixes and improvements [GH-412] [GH-474] [GH-476]\n   [GH-482] [GH-483] [GH-486] [GH-508] [GH-568] [GH-574] [GH-586] [GH-590]\n   [GH-591] [GH-592] [GH-595] [GH-613] [GH-637]\n * Less \"armon\" in stack traces [GH-453]\n * Sourcegraph integration [GH-456]\n\n## 0.2.0 (July 13, 2015)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n * **Key Rotation Support**: The `rotate` command can be used to rotate the\n   master encryption key used to write data to the storage (physical) backend.\n   [GH-277]\n * **Rekey Support**: Rekey can be used to rotate the master key and change the\n   configuration of the unseal keys (number of shares, threshold required).\n   [GH-277]\n * **New secret backend: `pki`**: Enable Vault to be a certificate authority\n   and generate signed TLS certificates.

          "content": "# Contributing to Vault\n\n**Please note:** We take Vault's security and our users' trust very seriously.\nIf you believe you have found a security issue in Vault, please responsibly\ndisclose by contacting us at security@hashicorp.com.\n\n**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, just ask or submit the\nissue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving it your best\neffort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change\nsomething. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of\nrules to get in the way of that. \n\nThat said, if you want to ensure that a pull request is likely to be merged,\ntalk to us! You can find out our thoughts and ensure that your contribution\nwon't clash or be obviated by Vault's normal direction. A great way to do this\nis via the [Vault Discussion Forum][2].\n\n## Issues\n\nThis section will cover what we're looking for in terms of reporting issues.\n\nBy addressing all the points we're looking for, it raises the chances we can\nquickly merge or address your contributions.\n\n### Reporting an Issue\n\n* Make sure you test against the latest released version. It is possible we\n  already fixed the bug you're experiencing. Even better is if you can test\n  against the `main` branch, as the bugs are regularly fixed but new versions\n  are only released every few months.\n\n* Provide steps to reproduce the issue, and if possible include the expected \n  results as well as the actual results. Please provide text, not screen shots!\n\n* If you are seeing an internal Vault error (a status code of 5xx), please be\n  sure to post relevant parts of (or the entire) Vault log, as often these\n  errors are logged on the server but not reported to the user.\n\n* If you experienced a panic, please create a [gist](https://gist.github.com)\n  of the *entire* generated crash log for us to look at. Double check\n  no sensitive items were in the log.\n\n* Respond as promptly as possible to any questions made by the Vault\n  team to your issue.\n\n### Issue Lifecycle\n\n1. The issue is reported.\n\n2. The issue is verified and categorized by a Vault collaborator.\n   Categorization is done via tags. For example, bugs are marked as \"bugs\".\n\n3. Unless it is critical, the issue may be left for a period of time (sometimes\n   many weeks), giving outside contributors -- maybe you!? -- a chance to\n   address the issue.\n\n4. The issue is addressed in a pull request or commit. The issue will be\n   referenced in the commit message so that the code that fixes it is clearly\n   linked.\n\n5. The issue is closed.\n\n6. Issues that are not reproducible and/or not gotten responses for a long time are\n   stale issues. In order to provide faster responses and better engagement with\n   the community, we strive to keep the issue tracker clean and the issue count\n   low. In this regard, our current policy is to close stale issues after 30 days.\n   Closed issues will still be indexed and available for future viewers. If users\n   feel that the issue is still relevant, we encourage reopening them.\n\n## Pull requests\n\nWhen submitting a PR you should reference an existing issue. If no issue already exists, \nplease create one. This can be skipped for trivial PRs like fixing typos.\n\nCreating an issue in advance of working on the PR can help to avoid duplication of effort, \ne.g. maybe we know of existing related work. Or it may be that we can provide guidance \nthat will help with your approach.\n\nYour pull request should have a description of what it accomplishes, how it does so,\nand why you chose the approach you did.  PRs should include unit tests that validate\ncorrectness and the existing tests must pass.  Follow-up work to fix tests\ndoes not need a fresh issue filed.\n\nSomeone will do a first pass review on your PR making sure it follows the guidelines \nin this document.  If it doesn't we'll mark the PR incomplete and ask you to follow\nup on the missing requirements.\n\n### Changelog Entries\nPlease include a file within your PR named `changelog/#.txt`, where `#` is your\npull request ID.  There are many examples under [changelog](changelog/), but\nthe general format is\n\n````\n```release-note:CATEGORY\nCOMPONENT: summary of change\n```\n````\n\nCATEGORY is one of `security`, `change`, `feature`, `improvement`, or `bug`.\nYour PR is almost certain to be one of `bug` or `improvement`, but don't\nworry too much about getting it exactly right, we'll tell you if a change is \nneeded.\n\nTo determine the relevant component, consult [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and pick\nwhichever one you see that seems the closest match.\n\nYou do not need to include the link at the end of the summary that appears in\nCHANGELOG.md, those are generated automatically by the changelog-building \nprocess.\n\n### Vault UI\n\nHow you contribute to the UI depends on what you want to contribute. If that is \na new feature, please submit an informational issue first.  That issue \nshould include a short description of the proposed feature, the use case,\nthe approach you're taking, and the tests that would be written.  A mockup\nis optional but encouraged.  \n\nBug fixes are welcome in PRs but existing tests must pass and updated logic \nshould be handled in new tests.  You needn't submit an issue first to fix bugs.\n\nKeep in mind that the UI should be consistent with other areas of Vault. \nThe UI should be user-centered, informative, and include edge cases and errors— \nincluding accommodations for users who may not have permissions to view or \ninteract with your feature. If you are not comfortable with UI design, a Vault\ndesigner can take a look at your work— just be aware that this might mean \nit will add some time to the PR process. \n\nFinally, in your code, try to avoid logic-heavy templates (when possible, \ncalculate values in the .js file instead of .hbs) and Ember anti-patterns. \nAnd most of all, if you have any questions, please ask!\n\n## Setting up Go to work on Vault\n\nIf you have never worked with Go before, you will have to complete the\nfollowing steps listed in the README, under the section [Developing Vault][1].\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/hashicorp/vault#developing-vault\n[2]: https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/vault\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nWe require that all contributors sign our Contributor License Agreement (\"CLA\") before we can accept the contribution. \n\n[Learn more about why HashiCorp requires a CLA and what the CLA includes](https://www.hashicorp.com/cla)\n"

A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.\n\nA modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.\n\nThe key features of Vault are:\n\n* **Secure Secret Storage**: Vault can store arbitrary key/value pairs. Vault encrypts data before writing it to persistent\n  storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access\n  your secrets. Vault can write to disk, [Consul](https://www.consul.io),\n  and more.\n\n* **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some\n  systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application\n  needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault\n  will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After\n  creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them\n  after the lease is up.\n\n* **Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing\n  it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and\n  developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without\n  having to design their own encryption methods.\n\n* **Leasing and Renewal**: Vault associates a **lease** with each secret.\n  At the end of the lease, Vault automatically revokes the\n  secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.\n\n* **Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault\n  can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example,\n  all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type.\n  Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the\n  case of an intrusion.\n\nDocumentation, Getting Started, and Certification Exams\n-------------------------------\n\nDocumentation is available on the [Vault website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs).\n\nIf you're new to Vault and want to get started with security automation, please\ncheck out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/getting-started)\non HashiCorp's learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault)\nto continue your learning.\n\nFor examples of how to interact with Vault from inside your application in different programming languages, see the [vault-examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-examples) repo. An out-of-the-box [sample application](https://github.com/hashicorp/hello-vault-go) is also available.\n\nShow off your Vault knowledge by passing a certification exam. Visit the\n[certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/#hashicorp-certified-vault-associate)\nfor information about exams and find [study materials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/certification)\non HashiCorp's learning platform.\n\nDeveloping Vault\n--------------------\n\nIf you wish to work on Vault itself or any of its built-in systems, you'll\nfirst need [Go](https://www.golang.org) installed on your machine.\n\nFor local dev first make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a\n[GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), then setting the \n[GOBIN](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables) variable to `$GOPATH/bin`. \nEnsure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your path as some distributions bundle the old version \nof build tools. \n\nNext, clone this repository. Vault uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules),\nso it is recommended that you clone the repository ***outside*** of the GOPATH.\nYou can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your environment:\n\n```sh\n$ make bootstrap\n...\n```\n\nTo compile a development version of Vault, run `make` or `make dev`. This will\nput the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:\n\n```sh\n$ make dev\n...\n$ bin/vault\n...\n```\n\nTo compile a development version of Vault with the UI, run `make static-dist dev-ui`. This will\nput the Vault binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders:\n\n```sh\n$ make static-dist dev-ui\n...\n$ bin/vault\n...\n```\n\nTo run tests, type `make test`. Note: this requires Docker to be installed. If\nthis exits with exit status 0, then everything is working!\n\n```sh\n$ make test\n...\n```\n\nIf you're developing a specific package, you can run tests for just that\npackage by specifying the `TEST` variable. For example below, only\n`vault` package tests will be run.\n\n```sh\n$ make test TEST=./vault\n...\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter an error like `could not read Username for 'https://github.com'` you may need to adjust your git config like so:\n\n```sh\n$ git config --global --add url.\"git@github.com:\".insteadOf \"https://github.com/\"\n```\n\n\n### Importing Vault\n\nThis repository publishes two libraries that may be imported by other projects:\n`github.com/hashicorp/vault/api` and `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk`.\n\nNote that this repository also contains Vault (the product), and as with most Go\nprojects, Vault uses Go modules to manage its dependencies. The mechanism to do\nthat is the [go.mod](./go.mod) file. As it happens, the presence of that file\nalso makes it theoretically possible to import Vault as a dependency into other\nprojects. Some other projects have made a practice of doing so in order to take\nadvantage of testing tooling that was developed for testing Vault itself. This\nis not, and has never been, a supported way to use the Vault project. We aren't \nlikely to fix bugs relating to failure to import `github.com/hashicorp/vault` \ninto your project.\n\nSee also the section \"Docker-based tests\" below.\n\n### Acceptance Tests\n\nVault has comprehensive [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)\ncovering most of the features of the secret and auth methods.\n\nIf you're working on a feature of a secret or auth method and want to\nverify it is functioning (and also hasn't broken anything else), we recommend\nrunning the acceptance tests.\n\n**Warning:** The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify *real resources*, which\nmay incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug, it is technically\npossible that broken backends could leave dangling data behind. Therefore,\nplease run the acceptance tests at your own risk. At the very least,\nwe recommend running them in their own private account for whatever backend\nyou're testing.\n\nTo run the acceptance tests, invoke `make testacc`:\n\n```sh\n$ make testacc TEST=./builtin/logical/consul\n...\n```\n\nThe `TEST` variable is required, and you should specify the folder where the\nbackend is. The `TESTARGS` variable is recommended to filter down to a specific\nresource to test, since testing all of them at once can sometimes take a very\nlong time.\n\nAcceptance tests typically require other environment variables to be set for\nthings such as access keys. The test itself should error early and tell\nyou what to set, so it is not documented here.\n\nFor more information on Vault Enterprise features, visit the [Vault Enterprise site](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=github-vault-enterprise).\n\n### Docker-based Tests\n\nWe have created an experimental new testing mechanism inspired by NewTestCluster.\nAn example of how to use it:\n\n```go\nimport (\n  \"testing\"\n  \"github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker\"\n)\n\nfunc Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := &docker.DockerClusterOptions{\n    ImageRepo: \"hashicorp/vault\", // or \"hashicorp/vault-enterprise\"\n    ImageTag:    \"latest\",\n  }\n  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)\n  defer cluster.Cleanup()\n  \n  client := cluster.Nodes()[0].APIClient()\n  _, err := client.Logical().Read(\"sys/storage/raft/configuration\")\n  if err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr for Enterprise:\n\n```go\nimport (\n  \"testing\"\n  \"github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster/docker\"\n)\n\nfunc Test_Something_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := &docker.DockerClusterOptions{\n    ImageRepo: \"hashicorp/vault-enterprise\",\n    ImageTag:  \"latest\",\n\tVaultLicense: licenseString, // not a path, the actual license bytes\n  }\n  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)\n  defer cluster.Cleanup()\n}\n```\n\nHere is a more realistic example of how we use it in practice.  DefaultOptions uses \n`hashicorp/vault`:`latest` as the repo and tag, but it also looks at the environment\nvariable VAULT_BINARY. If populated, it will copy the local file referenced by\nVAULT_BINARY into the container. This is useful when testing local changes.\n\nInstead of setting the VaultLicense option, you can set the VAULT_LICENSE_CI environment\nvariable, which is better than committing a license to version control.\n\nOptionally you can set COMMIT_SHA, which will be appended to the image name we\nbuild as a debugging convenience.\n\n```go\nfunc Test_Custom_Build_With_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)\n  cluster := docker.NewTestDockerCluster(t, opts)\n  defer cluster.Cleanup()\n}\n```\n\nThere are a variety of helpers in the `github.com/hashicorp/vault/sdk/helper/testcluster`\npackage, e.g. these tests below will create a pair of 3-node clusters and link them using\nPR or DR replication respectively, and fail if the replication state doesn't become healthy\nbefore the passed context expires.\n\nAgain, as written, these depend on having a Vault Enterprise binary locally and the env\nvar VAULT_BINARY set to point to it, as well as having VAULT_LICENSE_CI set.\n\n```go\nfunc TestStandardPerfReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)\n  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)\n  if err != nil {\n      t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  defer r.Cleanup()\n\n  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)\n  defer cancel()\n  err = r.StandardPerfReplication(ctx)\n  if err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc TestStandardDRReplication_Docker(t *testing.T) {\n  opts := docker.DefaultOptions(t)\n  r, err := docker.NewReplicationSetDocker(t, opts)\n  if err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n  defer r.Cleanup()\n\n  ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Minute)\n  defer cancel()\n  err = r.StandardDRReplication(ctx)\n  if err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(err)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, here's an example of running an existing OSS docker test with a custom binary:\n\n```bash\n$ GOOS=linux make dev\n$ VAULT_BINARY=$(pwd)/bin/vault go test -run 'TestRaft_Configuration_Docker' ./vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary\nok      github.com/hashicorp/vault/vault/external_tests/raft/raft_binary        20.960s\n```\n"
