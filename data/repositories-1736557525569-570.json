          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThanks for considering contributing to `react-beautiful-dnd`! ❤️\n\nThere are a few categories of contribution so we'll go through them individually.\n\n## Documentation\n\nIf you think the docs could be improved - please feel free to raise a pull request!\n\n## Bug\n\nIf you spot a bug you are welcome to raise it on our issue page. You are also welcome to take a crack at fixing it if you like! When you create an issue you will be prompted with the details we would like you to provide.\n\n## Feature request\n\nIf you would like to see a feature added to the library, here is what you do:\n\n1.  Have a read of `README.md` to understand the motivations of this library. It is fairly opinionated and is not intended to be a universal drag and drop library. As such, it will not support every drag and drop interaction.\n2.  Have a search through the [open and closed issues](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to see if the feature you are requesting as already been requested.\n3.  Have a clear and general purpose keyboard story for any feature request\n4.  Please [create an issue](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/new) to discuss it.\n\n**Please do not raise a pull request directly**. There may be reasons why we will not add every feature to this library.\n\n## Large contributions\n\nIf you are interested in making a large contribution to this library there is some recommended reading / training we suggest. There is a large amount of different libraries, techniques and tools used in `react-beautiful-dnd` and we have created a list with resources about them. Not everything in the list will be applicable to everyone. But it is a great reference and starting point for those who do not know where to start.\n\nThe online courses listed are no free - feel free to seek out alternatives if you want to. We recommend the egghead.io courses because they are quite comprehensive.\n\n### General knowledge\n\n- [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS): This is an amazing resource that I recommend all the time. It is great for having a deeper understanding of the JavaScript language.\n\n### Technologies\n\n#### `React`\n\nThis is a `React` project so getting familiar with `React` is a must!\n\n- [`react`](https://facebook.github.io/react/)\n- [An intro to using React](https://egghead.io/courses/start-using-react-to-build-web-applications)\n\n#### `Redux`\n\nThis project uses `redux` for its state management. If you have not used `redux` before it is worth getting familiar with it.\n\n- [`redux`](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/): the library itself has really great docs\n- [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux): the whole course\n- [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux): no need to do the lessons on react router or data fetching\n- [`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux): `react` bindings for `redux`\n- [`reselect`](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect): we use `reselect` heavily to ensure that state selectors are as fast as they can be. Please have a read of its main page, especially the [sharing Selectors with Props Across Multiple Components](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect#sharing-selectors-with-props-across-multiple-components) section.\n\n#### Testing\n\nWe test our application very thoroughly. Changes will not be accepted without tests\n\n- [`jest`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/): We use the jest test runner. It is worth getting familiar with it\n- [Test JavaScript with Jest](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-test-javascript-with-jest)\n- [React Testing Cookbook](https://egghead.io/courses/react-testing-cookbook)\n\n#### Performance\n\nPerformance is **critical** to this project. Please get familiar with React performance considerations. Changes that break core performance characteristics will not be accepted.\n\n- [Performance optimisations for React applications](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/performance-optimisations-for-react-applications-b453c597b191)\n- [Performance optimisations for React applications round 2](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/performance-optimisations-for-react-applications-round-2-2042e5c9af97)\n- [React performance tools](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/perf.html)\n- [React performance documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html)\n- [React is slow, React is fast](https://marmelab.com/blog/2017/02/06/react-is-slow-react-is-fast.html)\n\n#### Flow\n\nThis codebase is typed with [`flow`](https://flow.org/). Changes will not be merged without correct flow typing. If you are not sure about a particular use case let flow break the build and it can be discussed in the pull request.\n\n- [`flow`](https://flow.org/en/docs/getting-started/): the `flow` docs are great\n- [Up and Running with Facebook Flow for Typed JavaScript](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-up-and-running-with-facebook-flow-for-typed-javascript): a small primer for running flow\n\n### Drag and drop problem space\n\n#### HTML5 drag and drop\n\nHow this library performs dragging is an implementation detail. The api is what users interact with. That said, this library does not use the html5 drag and drop api. The main reason is that html5 drag and drop does not allow the level of control we need to create our powerful and beautiful experiences. I could go into detail but this is not the right forum.\n\nHere is some general reading about html5 drag and drop. It is worth having a read to get familiar with its ideas and api\n\n- [HTML5 drag and drop api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)\n- [HTML5 Rocks - dnd basics](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/)\n- [The HTML5 drag and drop disaster](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html)\n- [HTML5 drag and drop browser inconsistencies](http://mereskin.github.io/dnd/)\n\n#### Prior work\n\nIt is worth looking at other libraries out there to see how they do drag and drop. Things to look at is their philosophy and api. `react-beautiful-dnd` is an opinionated, higher level abstraction than most drag and drop libraries. We do not need to support every use case. We need to find the right level of control while still maintaining a beautiful experience for the user, flexibility of use and a clean, powerful api.\n\n- [`react-dnd`](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/) - `react-beautiful-dnd` draws a fair amount of inspiration from `react-dnd`. Something to keep in mind is that `react-dnd` is designed to provide a set of drag and drop primitives which is a different set of goals to this project.\n- [`react-sortable-hoc`](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/) - on the surface this library looks similar to `react-beautiful-dnd`. I created a [comparison blog](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/thanks-for-reaching-out-dimitar-nestorov-8c0bf9abe19) that explains the differences\n- [`jQuery sortable`](http://jqueryui.com/sortable/) - the king of drag and drop for a long time\n"

We also provide complete customisation control and internationalisation support for those who need it 💖\n- [Conditional dragging](/docs/api/draggable.md#optional-props) and [conditional dropping](/docs/api/droppable.md#conditionally-dropping)\n- Multiple independent lists on the one page\n- Flexible item sizes - the draggable items can have different heights (vertical lists) or widths (horizontal lists)\n- [Add and remove items during a drag](/docs/guides/changes-while-dragging.md)\n- Compatible with semantic `<table>` reordering - [table pattern](/docs/patterns/tables.md)\n- [Auto scrolling](/docs/guides/auto-scrolling.md) - automatically scroll containers and the window as required during a drag (even with keyboard 🔥)\n- Custom drag handles - you can drag a whole item by just a part of it\n- Able to move the dragging item to another element while dragging (clone, portal) - [Reparenting your `<Draggable />`](/docs/guides/reparenting.md)\n- [Create scripted drag and drop experiences 🎮](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md)\n- Allows extensions to support for [any input type you like 🕹](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md)\n- 🌲 Tree support through the [`@atlaskit/tree`](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/confluence/tree) package\n- A `<Droppable />` list can be a scroll container (without a scrollable parent) or be the child of a scroll container (that also does not have a scrollable parent)\n- Independent nested lists - a list can be a child of another list, but you cannot drag items from the parent list into a child list\n- Server side rendering (SSR) compatible - see [resetServerContext()](/docs/api/reset-server-context.md)\n- Plays well with [nested interactive elements](/docs/api/draggable.md#interactive-child-elements-within-a-draggable-) by default\n\n## Motivation 🤔\n\n`react-beautiful-dnd` exists to create beautiful drag and drop for lists that anyone can use - even people who cannot see. For a good overview of the history and motivations of the project you can take a look at these external resources:\n\n- 📖 [Rethinking drag and drop](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/rethinking-drag-and-drop-d9f5770b4e6b)\n- 🎧 [React podcast: fast, accessible and beautiful drag and drop](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/17)\n\n## Not for everyone ✌️\n\nThere are a lot of libraries out there that allow for drag and drop interactions within React. Most notable of these is the amazing [`react-dnd`](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd). It does an incredible job at providing a great set of drag and drop primitives which work especially well with the [wildly inconsistent](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html) html5 drag and drop feature. `react-beautiful-dnd` is a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists (vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on). Within that subset of functionality `react-beautiful-dnd` offers a powerful, natural and beautiful drag and drop experience. However, it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by `react-dnd`. So `react-beautiful-dnd` might not be for you depending on what your use case is.\n\n## Documentation 📖\n\n### About 👋\n\n- [Installation](/docs/about/installation.md)\n- [Examples and samples](/docs/about/examples.md)\n- [Get started](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd)\n- [Design principles](/docs/about/design-principles.md)\n- [Animations](/docs/about/animations.md)\n- [Accessibility](/docs/about/accessibility.md)\n- [Browser support](/docs/about/browser-support.md)\n\n### Sensors 🔉\n\n> The ways in which somebody can start and control a drag\n\n- [Mouse dragging 🐭](/docs/sensors/mouse.md)\n- [Touch dragging 👉📱](/docs/sensors/touch.md)\n- [Keyboard dragging 🎹♿️](/docs/sensors/keyboard.md)\n- [Create your own sensor](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md) (allows for any input type as well as scripted experiences)\n\n### API 🏋️‍\n\n![diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2182637/53607406-c8f3a780-3c12-11e9-979c-7f3b5bd1bfbd.gif)\n\n- [`<DragDropContext />`](/docs/api/drag-drop-context.md) - _Wraps the part of your application you want to have drag and drop enabled for_\n- [`<Droppable />`](/docs/api/droppable.md) - _An area that can be dropped into.
