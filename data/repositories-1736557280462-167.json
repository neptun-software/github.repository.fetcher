In this case, **adding a new language key** via `$t(\"languageKey\")` might be nessesary\n  - language keys need to be **added to `en.json`** to be visible in weblate. If this has not happened, a PR is appreciated.\n  - **Adding a new language** requires a new file see [these instructions](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/src/lang/README.md)\n  \n  <sub>Because maintainer time is precious, junior maintainers may merge uncontroversial PRs in this area.</sub>\n  </p>\n  </details> \n- <details><summary><b>new notification providers</b></summary>\n  <p>\n  \n  To set up a new notification provider these files need to be modified/created:\n  - `server/notification-providers/PROVIDER_NAME.js` is where the heart of the notification provider lives.\n    - Both `monitorJSON` and `heartbeatJSON` can be `null` for some events.\n      If both are `null`, this is a general testing message, but if just `heartbeatJSON` is `null` this is a certificate expiry.\n    - Please wrap the axios call into a \n      ```js\n      try {\n        let result = await axios.post(...);\n        if (result.status === ...) ...\n      } catch (error) {\n        this.throwGeneralAxiosError(error);\n      }\n      ```\n  - `server/notification.js` is where the backend of the notification provider needs to be registered.\n    *If you have an idea how we can skip this step, we would love to hear about it ^^*\n  - `src/components/NotificationDialog.vue` you need to decide if the provider is a regional or a global one and add it with a name to the respective list\n  - `src/components/notifications/PROVIDER_NAME.vue` is where the frontend of each provider lives.\n    Please make sure that you have:\n    - used `HiddenInput` for secret credentials\n    - included all the necessary helptexts/placeholder/.. to make sure the notification provider is simple to setup for new users. \n    - include all translations (`{{ $t(\"Translation key\") }}`, [`i18n-t keypath=\"Translation key\">`](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/advanced/component.html)) in `src/lang/en.json` to enable our translators to translate this\n  - `src/components/notifications/index.js` is where the frontend of the provider needs to be registered.\n    *If you have an idea how we can skip this step, we would love to hear about it ^^*\n\n  Offering notifications is close to the core of what we are as an uptime monitor.\n  Therefore, making sure that they work is also really important.\n  Because testing notification providers is quite time intensive, we mostly offload this onto the person contributing a notification provider.\n  \n  To make sure you have tested the notification provider, please include screenshots of the following events in the pull-request description:\n    - `UP`/`DOWN`\n    - Certificate Expiry via https://expired.badssl.com/\n    - Testing (the test button on the notification provider setup page)\n  \n  Using the following way to format this is encouraged:\n  ```md\n  | Event | Before | After |\n  ------------------\n  | `UP` | paste-image-here | paste-image-here |\n  | `DOWN` | paste-image-here | paste-image-here |\n  | Certificate-expiry | paste-image-here | paste-image-here |\n  | Testing | paste-image-here | paste-image-here |\n  ```\n\n  <sub>Because maintainer time is precious, junior maintainers may merge uncontroversial PRs in this area.</sub>\n  </p>\n  </details>\n- <details><summary><b>new monitoring types</b></summary>\n  <p>\n\n  To set up a new notification provider these files need to be modified/created:\n  - `server/monitor-types/MONITORING_TYPE.js` is the core of each monitor.\n    the `async check(...)`-function should:\n    - throw an error for each fault that is detected with an actionable error message\n    - in the happy-path, you should set `heartbeat.msg` to a successful message and set `heartbeat.status = UP`\n  - `server/uptime-kuma-server.js` is where the monitoring backend needs to be registered.\n    *If you have an idea how we can skip this step, we would love to hear about it ^^*\n  - `src/pages/EditMonitor.vue` is the shared frontend users interact with.\n    Please make sure that you have:\n    - used `HiddenInput` for secret credentials\n    - included all the necessary helptexts/placeholder/.. to make sure the notification provider is simple to setup for new users.\n    -

\n\n\n  <sub>Because maintainer time is precious, junior maintainers may merge uncontroversial PRs in this area.</sub>\n  </p>\n  </details> \n- <details><summary><b>new features/ major changes / breaking bugfixes</b></summary>\n  <p>\n  \n  be sure to **create an empty draft pull request or open an issue, so we can have a discussion first**.\n  This is especially important for a large pull request or when you don't know if it will be merged or not.\n  \n  <sub>Because of the large impact of this work, only senior maintainers may merge PRs in this area.</sub>\n  </p>\n  </details>\n\nThe following rules are essential for making your PR mergable:\n- Merging multiple issues by a huge PR is more difficult to review and causes conflicts with other PRs. Please\n  - (if possible) **create one PR for one issue** or\n  - (if not possible) **explain which issues a PR addresses and why this PR should not be broken apart**\n- Make sure your **PR passes our continuous integration**.\n  PRs will not be merged unless all CI-Checks are green.\n- **Breaking changes** (unless for a good reason and discussed beforehand) will not get merged / not get merged quickly.\n  Such changes require a major version release.\n- **Test your code** before submitting a PR.\n  Buggy PRs will not be merged.\n- Make sure the **UI/UX is close to Uptime Kuma**.\n- **Think about the maintainability**:\n  Don't add functionality that is completely **out of scope**.\n  Keep in mind that we need to be able to maintain the functionality.\n- Don't modify or delete existing logic without a valid reason.\n- Don't convert existing code into other programming languages for no reason.\n\nI ([@louislam](https://github.com/louislam)) have the final say.\nIf your pull request does not meet my expectations, I will reject it, no matter how much time you spent on it.\nTherefore, it is essential to have a discussion beforehand.\n\nI will assign your pull request to a [milestone](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/milestones), if I plan to review and merge it.\n\nPlease don't rush or ask for an ETA.\nWe have to understand the pull request, make sure it has no breaking changes and stick to the vision of this project, especially for large pull requests.\n\n\n## I'd like to work on an issue. How do I do that?\n\nWe have found that assigning people to issues is management-overhead that we don't need.\nA short comment that you want to try your hand at this issue is appreciated to save other devs time.\nIf you come across any problem during development, feel free to leave a comment with what you are stuck on.\n\n### Recommended Pull Request Guideline\n\nBefore diving deep into coding, having a discussion first by creating an empty pull request for discussion is preferred.\nThe rationale behind this is that we can align the direction and scope of the feature to eliminate any conflicts with existing and planned work, and can help by pointing out any potential pitfalls.\n\n1. Fork the project\n2. Clone your fork repo to local\n3. Create a new branch\n4. Create an empty commit: `git commit -m \"<YOUR TASK NAME>\" --allow-empty`\n5. Push to your fork repo\n6. Prepare a pull request: https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/compare\n7. Write a proper description. You can mention @louislam in it, so @louislam will get the notification.\n8. Create your pull request as a Draft\n9. Wait for the discussion\n\n## Project Styles\n\nI personally do not like something that requires a lot of configuration before you can finally start the app.\nThe goal is to make the Uptime Kuma installation as easy as installing a mobile app.\n\n- Easy to install for non-Docker users\n  - no native build dependency is needed (for `x86_64`/`armv7`/`arm64`)\n  - no extra configuration and\n  - no extra effort required to get it running\n- Single container for Docker users\n  - no complex docker-compose file\n  - mapping the volume and exposing the port should be the only requirements\n- Settings should be configurable in the frontend. Environment variables are discouraged, unless it is related to startup such as `DATA_DIR`\n- Easy to use\n- The web UI styling should be consistent and nice\n\n## Coding Styles\n\n- 4 spaces indentation\n- Follow `.editorconfig`\n- Follow ESLint\n- Methods and functions should be documented with JSDoc\n\n## Name Conventions\n\n- Javascript/Typescript: camelCaseType\n- SQLite: snake_case (Underscore)\n- CSS/SCSS: kebab-case (Dash)\n\n## Tools\n\n- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18\n- [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 9.3\n- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)\n- IDE that supports [`ESLint`](https://eslint.org/) and EditorConfig (I am using [`IntelliJ IDEA`](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))\n- A SQLite GUI tool (f.ex. [`SQLite Expert Personal`](https://www.sqliteexpert.com/download.html) or [`DBeaver Community`](https://dbeaver.io/download/))\n\n## Git Branches\n\n- `master`: 2.X.X development. If you want to add a new feature, your pull request should base on this.\n- `1.23.X`: 1.23.X development. If you want to fix a bug for v1 and v2, your pull request should base on this.\n- All other branches are unused, outdated or for dev.\n\n## Install Dependencies for Development\n\n```bash\nnpm ci\n```\n\n## Dev Server\n\n(2022-04-26 Update)\n\nWe can start the frontend dev server and the backend dev server in one command.\n\nPort `3000` and port `3001` will be used.\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nBut sometimes you may want to restart the server without restarting the frontend. In that case, you can run these commands in two terminals:\n\n```bash\nnpm run start-frontend-dev\nnpm run start-server-dev\n```\n\n## Backend Server\n\nIt binds to `0.0.0.0:3001` by default.\n\nThe backend is an `express.js` server with `socket.io` integrated.\nIt uses `socket.io` to communicate with clients, and most server logic is encapsulated in the `socket.io` handlers.\n`express.js` is also used to serve:\n\n- as an entry point for redirecting to a status page or the dashboard\n- the frontend built files (`index.html`, `*.js`, `*.css`, etc.)\n- internal APIs of the status page\n\n### Structure in `/server/`\n\n- `jobs/` (Jobs that are running in another process)\n- `model/` (Object model, auto-mapping to the database table name)\n- `modules/` (Modified 3rd-party modules)\n- `monitor_types/` (Monitor Types)\n- `notification-providers/` (individual notification logic)\n- `routers/` (Express Routers)\n- `socket-handler/` (Socket.io Handlers)\n- `server.js` (Server entry point)\n- `uptime-kuma-server.js` (UptimeKumaServer class, main logic should be here, but some still in `server.js`)\n\n## Frontend Dev Server\n\nIt binds to `0.0.0.0:3000` by default. The frontend dev server is used for development only.\n\nFor production, it is not used. It will be compiled to `dist` directory instead.\n\nYou can use Vue.js devtools Chrome extension for debugging.\n\n### Build the frontend\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n### Frontend Details\n\nUptime Kuma Frontend is a single page application (SPA). Most paths are handled by Vue Router.\n\nThe router is in `src/router.js`\n\nAs you can see, most data in the frontend is stored at the root level, even though you changed the current router to any other pages.\n\nThe data and socket logic are in `src/mixins/socket.js`.\n\n## Database Migration\n\nSee: https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/tree/master/db/knex_migrations\n\n## Unit Test\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nBoth frontend and backend share the same `package.json`.\nHowever, the frontend dependencies are eventually not used in the production environment, because it is usually also baked into `dist` files. So:\n\n- Frontend dependencies = \"devDependencies\"\n  - Examples: `vue`, `chart.js`\n- Backend dependencies = \"dependencies\"\n  - Examples: `socket.io`, `sqlite3`\n- Development dependencies = \"devDependencies\"\n  - Examples: `eslint`, `sass`\n\n### Update Dependencies\n\nSince previously updating Vite 2.5.10 to 2.6.0 broke the application completely, from now on, it should update the patch release version only.\n\nPatch release = the third digit ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/))\n\nIf for security / bug / other reasons, a library must be updated, breaking changes need to be checked by the person proposing the change.\n\n## Translations\n\nPlease add **all** the strings which are translatable to `src/lang/en.json` (if translation keys are omitted, they can not be translated.)\n\n**Don't include any other languages in your initial pull request** (even if this is your mother tongue), to avoid merge-conflicts between weblate and `master`.\nThe translations can then (after merging a PR into `master`) be translated by awesome people donating their language skills.\n\nIf you want to help by translating Uptime Kuma into your language, please visit the [instructions on how to translate using weblate](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/src/lang/README.md).\n\n## Spelling & Grammar\n\nFeel free to correct the grammar in the documentation or code.\nMy mother language is not English and my grammar is not that great.\n\n## Wiki\n\nSince there is no way to make a pull request to the wiki, I have set up another repo to do that.\n\nhttps://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma-wiki\n\n## Docker\n\n### Arch\n\n- amd64\n- arm64\n- armv7\n\n### Docker Tags\n\n#### v2\n\n- `2`, `latest-2`: v2 with full features such as Chromium and bundled MariaDB\n- `2.x.x`\n- `2-slim`: v2 with basic features\n- `2.x.x-slim`\n- `beta2`: Latest beta build\n- `2.x.x-beta.x`\n- `nightly2`: Dev build\n- `base2`: Basic Debian setup without Uptime Kuma source code (Full features)\n- `base2-slim`: Basic Debian setup without Uptime Kuma source code\n- `pr-test2`: For testing pull request without setting up a local environment\n\n#### v1\n\n- `1`, `latest`, `1-debian`, `debian`: Latest version of v1\n- `1.x.x`, `1.x.x-debian`\n- `1.x.x-beta.x`: Beta build\n- `beta`: Latest beta build\n- `nightly`: Dev build\n- `base-debian`: Basic Debian setup without Uptime Kuma source code\n- `pr-test`: For testing pull request without setting up a local environment\n- `base-alpine`: (Deprecated) Basic Alpine setup without Uptime Kuma source code\n- `1-alpine`, `alpine`: (Deprecated)\n- `1.x.x-alpine`: (Deprecated)\n\n## Maintainer\n\nCheck the latest issues and pull requests:\nhttps://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc\n\n### What is a maintainer and what are their roles?\n\nThis project has multiple maintainers who specialise in different areas.\nCurrently, there are 3 maintainers:\n\n| Person            | Role              | Main Area        |\n|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| `@louislam`       | senior maintainer | major features   |\n| `@chakflying`     | junior maintainer | fixing bugs      |\n| `@commanderstorm` | junior maintainer | issue-management |\n\n### Procedures\n\nWe have a few procedures we follow. These are documented here:\n- <details><summary>Set up a Docker Builder</summary>\n  <p>\n\n  - amd64, armv7 using local.\n  - arm64 using remote arm64 cpu, as the emulator is too slow and can no longer pass the `npm ci` command.\n     1. Add the public key to the remote server.\n     2. Add the remote context. The remote machine must be arm64 and installed Docker CE. \n        ```\n        docker context create oracle-arm64-jp --docker \"host=ssh://root@100.107.174.88\"\n        ```\n     3. Create a new builder.\n        ```\n        docker buildx create --name kuma-builder --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7\n        docker buildx use kuma-builder\n        docker buildx inspect --bootstrap\n        ```\n     4. Append the remote context to the builder.\n        ```\n        docker buildx create --append --name kuma-builder --platform linux/arm64 oracle-arm64-jp\n        ```\n     5. Verify the builder and check if the builder is using `kuma-builder`.\n        ```\n        docker buildx inspect kuma-builder\n        docker buildx ls\n        ```\n  </p>\n  </details>\n- <details><summary>Release</summary>\n  <p>\n\n  1. Draft a release note\n  2. Make sure the repo is cleared\n  3. If the healthcheck is updated, remember to re-compile it: `npm run build-docker-builder-go`\n  4. `npm run release-final` with env vars: `VERSION` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`\n  5. Wait until the `Press any key to continue`\n  6. `git push`\n  7. Publish the release note as `1.X.X`\n  8. Press any key to continue\n  9. Deploy to the demo server: `npm run deploy-demo-server`\n\n  These Items need to be checked:\n\n  - [ ] Check all tags is fine on https://hub.docker.com/r/louislam/uptime-kuma/tags\n  - [ ] Try the Docker image with tag 1.X.X (Clean install / amd64 / arm64 / armv7)\n  - [ ] Try clean installation with Node.js\n  \n  </p>\n  </details>\n- <details><summary>Release Beta</summary>\n  <p>\n\n  1. Draft a release note, check `This is a pre-release`\n  2. Make sure the repo is cleared\n  3. `npm run release-beta` with env vars: `VERSION` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`\n  4. Wait until the `Press any key to continue`\n  5. Publish the release note as `1.X.X-beta.X`\n  6. Press any key to continue\n  \n  </p>\n  </details>\n- <details><summary>Release Wiki</summary>\n  <p>\n\n  **Setup Repo**\n  \n  ```bash\n  git clone https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma-wiki.git\n  cd uptime-kuma-wiki\n  git remote add production https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma.wiki.git\n  ```\n  \n  **Push to Production Wiki**\n  \n  ```bash\n  git pull\n  git push production master\n  ```\n  \n  </p>\n  </details>\n- <details><summary>Change the base of a pull request such as <code>master</code> to <code>1.23.X</code></summary>\n  <p>\n  \n  ```bash\n  git rebase --onto <new parent> <old parent>\n  ```\n  \n  </p>\n  </details>\n"
