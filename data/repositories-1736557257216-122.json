It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! 😊\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with\n- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)\n- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...\n- **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...\n- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist/issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.\n- **Money**: we welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/front-end-checklist).\n\n## Your First Contribution\n\nWorking on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n\n## Submitting code\n\nAny code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.\n\n## Code review process\n\nThe bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.\nIt is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?\n\n## Financial contributions\n\nWe also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/front-end-checklist).\nAnyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be \"merged\" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.\n\n## Questions\n\nIf you have any questions, create an [issue](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist/issues) (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!).\nYou can also reach us at hello@front-end-checklist.opencollective.com.\n\n## Credits\n\n### Contributors\n\nThank you to all the people who have already contributed to front-end-checklist!\n<a href=\"https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist/graphs/contributors\"><img src=\"https://opencollective.com/front-end-checklist/contributors.svg?width=890\" /></a>\n\n\n### Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers!

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\").
